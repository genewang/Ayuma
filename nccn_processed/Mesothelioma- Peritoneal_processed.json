Of all mesotheliomas, ~85% arise from the \npleura, ~15% arise from the peritoneum, and the remainder (<1%) originate from the pericardium or the tunica vaginalis.1 \n• In the United States, diffuse pleural mesothelioma affects ~3,000 patients each year , with an annual incidence of ~1 in 100,000.2,3\n• The purpose of the pathologic evaluation of mesothelioma is based on the pathologic assessment of tumor tissue, which can be obtained \nfrom core biopsy sampling, pleurectomy, or other more extensive resections such as extrapleural pneumonectomy. Given its rarity and \noverlapping microscopic features with other conditions, the histologic diagnosis of diffuse mesothelioma can be challenging. \n• To establish a pathologic diagnosis of mesothelioma, diagnostic tools that are used clinically include histologic assessment, \nimmunohistochemistry (IHC), cytogenetics, and molecular techniques (such as targeted next-generation sequencing [NGS], fluorescence in \nsitu hybridization [FISH], and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays). Despite the multiple diagnostic toolkits, the diagnosis relies primarily \non proper histologic assessment and IHC.\n• The new edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Thoracic Tumors by the International Agency for Research on \nCancer (IARC) introduced the following changes for 2021 from the previous 2015 edition:1,4\n\u0017New entity: mesothelioma in situ\n\u0017New terminology: diffuse pleural mesothelioma (instead of diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma)\n\u0017New terminology: localized pleural mesothelioma (instead of localized malignant pleural mesothelioma)\n\u0017New terminology: well-differentiated papillary mesothelial tumor (WDPMT , instead of well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma)\n\u0017Genetic tumor syndromes involving the thorax: BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by \nheterozygous germline pathogenic variants in the BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein 1) gene.\n• The descriptions below refer to diffuse mesothelioma, which will be named mesothelioma for the purpose of simplicity.\nMesothelioma Classification\n• Mesothelioma is classified into three histologic types: epithelioid, biphasic (mixed), and sarcomatoid, which have significant prognostic \nvalue.1\n• The determination of histologic types is based on the cytologic features of the tumor:\n\u0017Epithelioid mesothelioma  is characterized by epithelioid-to-round cells.\n\u0017Sarcomatoid mesothelioma is characterized by spindled cells with tapered nuclei.\n\u0017Biphasic mesothelioma contains both epithelioid and sarcomatoid components in various proportions, with each comprising at least 10% \nof the tumor.

Appropriate \ntype classification of mesothelioma is nonetheless important, given the prognostic significance of different histologic types.\n\u0017Studies comparing the concordance between histologic type in initial biopsies with subsequent resections have shown that the accuracy \nof typing increases with a higher number of biopsies.14 While sarcomatoid histology in biopsies is highly predictive of sarcomatoid \nhistology in resections, epithelioid histology in biopsies is not entirely specific and is changed to biphasic or sarcomatoid types in \nresections in up to 20% of patients.14\nHistologic Criteria for Mesothelioma\n• In mesothelioma, the goals of histologic assessment are to confirm the pathologic diagnosis and to determine the histologic type, which \nallows for prognostication and treatment planning. For the diagnosis of mesothelioma, one needs to establish each of the three conditions \nbelow:\n\u0017The lesion is diffuse and not solitary . Correlation with clinical and radiologic findings is needed to confirm that the distribution of the tumor \nis diffuse rather than solitary. While almost all (>99%) mesotheliomas are diffuse, rare cases of localized pleural mesothelioma  have been \ndescribed, which are solitary, have a different pathogenesis, and harbor a relatively less aggressive clinical course.15-18\n\u0017The lesional cells are mesothelial . Given the morphologic overlap between mesothelioma and diverse mimics such as carcinomas, IHC can \nbe used to confirm the presence of mesothelial differentiation in the tumor cells. Other tools such as cytogenetics and molecular analysis \nmay also be helpful in some instances (see next page).\n\u0017The lesional cells are malignant . Histologic assessment is integral to establish that the mesothelial cells are malignant. Morphologic \nfeatures that distinguish mesothelioma from reactive conditions include: 1) invasion into adjacent tissue, such as adipose or fibrous \ntissue, and skeletal muscle; 2) full-thickness serosal involvement; and 3) formation of expansile nodules (considered as a type of fibrous \ntissue invasion). The presence of tissue invasion is considered to be the most reliable criterion in distinguishing mesothelioma from \nreactive mesothelial proliferations.19,20 On the other hand, “worrisome” features such as necrosis, cytologic atypia, and mitoses should be \ninterpreted with caution, since each can be present in reactive pleuritis and do not necessarily indicate malignancy.\n• Interpretation can be difficult when there is limited diagnostic tissue, tangential sectioning, artifacts from histologic processing, and/\nor entrapment of adjacent structures mimicking invasion.19,21 For a mesothelial proliferation that is suspicious for, but not definitive for \nmalignancy, one may report the findings as “atypical mesothelial proliferation” and recommend re-biopsy and/or close follow-up.\n• In the distinction between mesothelioma and benign, reactive mesothelial proliferations, the role of ancillary studies has been limited until \nrecently, where BAP1 or MTAP IHC and CDKN2A  copy number assessment by FISH may aid in the distinction in some instances (see next \npage).22 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:41 PM.

Therefore, it is recommended that a panel including at least \ntwo mesothelial markers (eg, calretinin, D2-40) and two carcinoma markers (eg, claudin-4, TTF-1, polyclonal CEA, PAX8) should be used to \nestablish the diagnosis.26\n• Broad-spectrum keratins ( eg, AE1/AE3, pancytokeratin, MNF116) are not specific and are expressed in both mesothelioma and carcinomas. \n• Sarcomatoid mesothelioma often shows focal to absent expression for most mesothelial markers, with the most sensitive marker being  \nD2-40/podoplanin.27 \n• Recently, GATA3 has been explored as a potential diagnostic marker for sarcomatoid mesotheliomas since GATA3 is expressed in only ~10%–\n20% of sarcomatoid carcinoma28 and strongly expressed in all sarcomatoid/desmoplastic mesotheliomas.29\nMarkers to Confirm a Mesothelial Malignant Proliferation\n• Although the distinction between mesothelioma and reactive mesothelial proliferations primarily relies on histologic assessment, this can be \nchallenging in some cases. \n• BAP1, MTAP IHC, and CDKN2A  (p16) FISH are established markers for diagnosing mesothelioma .22 \n\u0017BAP1 IHC is a specific (though not sensitive) marker to distinguish mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial proliferations. \n\u0017BAP1 is a tumor suppressor implicated in the pathogenesis of mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and  clear cell renal \ncell carcinoma.30 Recurrent somatic and/or germline mutations in BAP1 are present in mesothelioma. As a surrogate for BAP1 genomic \nstatus, BAP1 IHC is used as a diagnostic marker for mesothelioma, whereas reactive proliferations have intact BAP1 nuclear staining. \nComplete absence of expression or cytoplasmic staining is considered a loss of BAP1 expression. Aberrant BAP1 protein expression, \ndefined as absence of nuclear BAP1 staining, is present in ~50%–70% of mesothelioma epithelioid type31-37 but in  <20% of sarcomatoid \ntype.38\n\u0017MTAP IHC has been used as a diagnostic marker for mesothelioma.39 MTAP is located near CDKN2A  on the chromosomal region 9p21. \nLoss of cytoplasmic MTAP staining is considered a surrogate for chromosomal 9p loss as determined by concurrent CDKN2A  FISH \ntesting39 and has been reported in ~40%–60% of mesothelioma but rarely in reactive proliferations.35-37 \n\u0017Although MTAP alone is not sensitive, combined use of BAP1 and MTAP IHC may improve sensitivity and specificity.35-37 Since ~10%–20% \nof lung adenocarcinomas have MTAP loss,36 MTAP IHC is not useful for distinction between mesothelioma and lung carcinoma.\n\u0017CDKN2A  FISH and MTAP IHC are less useful for the diagnosis of peritoneal mesotheliomas because the prevalence of CDKN2A  deletions is \n8%–26% and MTAP loss is 14%–16% in peritoneal mesotheliomas.40-44\n• Additional IHC markers such as 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5-HMC), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), cyclin D1, and programmed death \nligand 1 (PD-L1),  and NF2 by FISH are all potentially useful to distinguish mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial proliferations, but need \nfurther study since their utility in clinical practice remains unclear.22 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:41 PM.

Furthermore, distinction between a mesothelioma with prominent papillary surface projections and WDPMT can be \nchallenging, particularly in small superficial biopsies. \n\u0017Adenomatoid tumor  primarily affects the genital tracts but rarely can involve the pleura; recurrent mutations in TRAF7 have been described \nin adenomatoid tumors of genital type.78\n\u0017Peritoneal inclusion cyst  is a benign, rare tumor that displays multiple mesothelial-lined cysts that may be distinguished from mesothelial \nneoplasia. This lesion is almost always located in the peritoneum, although uncommon cases have been described in the pleura. These \ncystic proliferations are lined by bland mesothelial cells and lack significant stratification, papillary structures, or atypia.\n\u0017Mesothelioma in situ  is a preinvasive, single-layer surface proliferation of neoplastic mesothelial cells. Since the diagnosis of \nmesothelioma in situ cannot be simply made on conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains, the diagnosis requires either 1) loss of \nBAP1 nuclear expression by IHC; and/or 2) CDKN2A  homozygous deletion identified either by FISH or by MTAP IHC (cytoplasmic staining). \nFurthermore, no mass lesions should be identified on imaging or thoracoscopy .PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:41 PM.

Peritoneal biopsy for diagnosis should \nprovide enough tissue for differentiation between peritoneal inclusion cyst, WDPMT , and subtypes of diffuse mesothelioma such as \nepithelioid, biphasic, and sarcomatoid. Cytology is generally not considered adequate for important histologic differentiation required for \ntreatment decisions.\n• For patients being considered for surgery, a laparoscopy is recommended to determine candidacy for complete cytoreduction.1\n• The goal of surgery is complete gross cytoreduction of the tumor. The goal of CRS is “macroscopic complete resection”—in other words, \nremoval of ALL visible or palpable tumors (CC-0). A near complete cytoreduction with <2.5 mm visible residual disease (CC-1) is also \nacceptable for epithelioid mesothelioma subtype, as a large multi-institutional study suggests <2% change in 5-year OS and unchanged \nmedian OS for epithelioid peritoneal mesothelioma undergoing CC-1 compared to CC-0.2 In cases where this is not possible, palliative \nsurgery and/or HIPEC can be considered if associated with minimal morbidity . Otherwise, surgery should be aborted/not offered.3\n• Complete cytoreduction frequently requires a total parietal peritonectomy, including visceral resections when necessary to achieve complete \ncytoreduction.4\n• Resectable epithelioid mesothelioma should undergo upfront CRS and HIPEC. If there are no high-risk features identified (such as positive \nlymph node [LN], incomplete cytoreduction, or high Ki-67 >9%)5 then surveillance is sufficient. If high-risk features are identified then \nconsideration for adjuvant therapy is recommended (see PEM-2).\n• For patients with biphasic, sarcomatoid, clinically positive LN, or high PCI >17, neoadjuvant therapy is strongly encouraged followed by re-\nevaluation for complete CRS and HIPEC.\n• For patients with bicavitary disease and minimal disease burden in the thorax, systemic therapy is recommended. Surgery can be \nconsidered in select cases.6\n• If a bevacizumab-containing regimen is administered, there should be at least a 6-week interval between the last dose and CRS.7,8\n• Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy regimens typically consist of cisplatin, carboplatin, or mitomycin C. Platinum agents (both cisplatin and \ncarboplatin) have been associated with improved outcomes over mitomycin C in retrospective comparisons.9,10\n• Early postoperative or prolonged adjuvant IP therapy have been investigated with some success and limited toxicity, but there remains \ninsufficient evidence to recommend their use outside of a clinical trial.11,12\n•  Patients whose disease recurs in the peritoneum after CRS and HIPEC should be re-evaluated for repeat CRS and HIPEC, as studies show \nthis can be done safely and with good outcomes in appropriately selected patients.13,14PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY\nIP Chemotherapy Regimens (PEM-C 2 of 3)\nCompleteness of Cytoreduction Score (PEM-C 2 of 3)\nPeritoneal Cancer Index Scoring System (PEM-C 2 of 3) References (PEM-C 3 of 3)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:41 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Peritoneal   \n \nMS-2 Overview \nMesothelioma is a rare cancer originating in mesothelial surfaces of the \nperitoneum, pleura, and other sites that is estimated to occur in \napproximately 3500 people in the United States every year.1-5 These \nNCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) focus \non peritoneal mesothelioma (PeM) , which is a less common type  \n(approximately 15%).  Most mesothelioma occurs in the pleura \n(approximately 85%); it can also occur very rarely in other sites, such as \nthe pericardium and tunica vaginalis testis .6-9 It is estimated that PeM \noccurs in approximately 300 to 400 people in the United States every \nyear.10 The true incidence may be higher because PeM may not be coded \ncorrectly; it may be misdiagnosed as other cancers that typically involve the peritoneum, such as ovarian cancer. The mean age is about 69 years \nat diagnosis of PeM . One -year overall survival is approximately 46% in \npatients with PeM , and 5 -year overall survival is about 20%; cure is rare.\n11 \nSurvival is improved for patients who are able to undergo complete \ncytoreductive surgery (CRS) with intraperitoneal chemotherapy.12-16 There \nare multiple intravenous systemic therapy options for patients who are not candidates for CRS, or those whose disease recurs following CRS with or \nwithout hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) . \nSimilar to pleural mesothelioma, the histologic subtypes of PeM  include \nepithelioid (most common), sarcomatoid, and biphasic (also known as \nmixed, containing both epithelioid and sarcomatoid components) .\n4,17- 19 \nPatients with epithelioid histology have better outcomes than those with \neither biphasic or sarcomatoid histologies; histology is used to direct \ntreatment.15 Although there are similarities between PeM  and pleural \nmesothelioma , there are unique differences.15 PeM is diagnosed in equal \nnumbers of males  and females ; pleural mesothelioma is more common in \nmales .11 In addition, PeM  may occur in younger patients, whereas pleural \nmesothelioma  typically occurs in older patients. Many patients with PeM  \nhave idiopathic disease.20 Pleural mesothelioma is typically caused by asbestos exposure; however, PeM  is less frequently associated with  \nasbestos  exposure .21-24 The incidence of pleural mesothelioma  and PeM is \ndecreasing in the United States, because asbestos use has decreased \nsince the  1970s.1,5,25- 28 Although asbestos is no longer mined in the United \nStates, it is still imported.28 Genetic factors play a role in some patients \nwith PeM, with families carrying a germline mutation in the \nBRCA1 -associated protein- 1 (BAP1 ) gene; a few patients have somatic \nmutations, such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK)  rearrangements or \nrare fusions .29-37  \nPatients with PeM  present with abdominal signs and symptoms, such as \nascites, pain, distension, and an abdominal mass.11,38 They often have a \nhigh symptom burden compared with patients who have other types of \ncancer. The diagnosis of PeM  may be delayed, because symptoms are \nnonspecific.11,21,24,38 Thus, many patients with PeM  have advanced \ndisease at diagnosis .11 Although PeM can spread extensively in the \nabdomen, it less commonly  metastasizes beyond the abdominal cavity.24  \nThese NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines ( NCCN Guidelines®) \nMesothelioma: Peritoneal were first published in 2021 and will be updated \nat least once every year . For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN \nPanel revised the title of the guideline to Mesothelioma: Peritoneal  to \nalign with the pleural mesothelioma guidelines ; the previous title was \nMalignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma. The term malignant  is no longer \nused to classify mesotheliomas, because all mesotheliomas are now \ndefined as malignant.39 The pathology  section was also updated to \ninclude new information about markers used to identify mesothelioma, \nwhich is difficult to diagnose;  PeM has distinct molecular features when \ncompared with pleural mesothelioma (see Principles of Pathologic \nReview) .40 A new abbreviations list was also added to the guidelines.  \nAdditional supplementary material in the NCCN Guidelines® for \nMesothelioma: Peritoneal  includes the Principles of Pathologic Review , PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:41 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Peritoneal   \n \nMS-3 Principles of Surgery, Principles of Systemic Therapy , and Principles of \nSupportive Care.  These NCCN Guidelines for Mesothelioma: Peritoneal  \nwere developed by panel members who also developed the NCCN \nGuidelines for Mesothelioma: Pleural  and the NCCN Guidelines for \nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer .  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at  www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines for Mesothelioma: Peritoneal, \nan electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key \nliterature in PeM  published since the previous Guidelines update, using \nthe search term: peritoneal mesothelioma. The PubMed database was \nchosen because it remains the most widely used resource for medical \nliterature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II ; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; \nGuideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta- Analysis; Systematic \nReviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key PubMed articles as \nwell as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these \nguidelines as discussed by the panel during the Guidelines update have \nbeen included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations \nfor which high- level evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of \nlower -level evidence and expert opinion.   \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use language that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -fat-biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue t o use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeabl y or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.   \nDiagnosis \nInitial Evaluation  \nPatients with PeM  present with abdominal signs and symptoms, such as \nascites (77%), pain (69%), distension, and an abdominal mass (30%); \nthey may also present with weight loss, fatigue, anorexia, asthenia, \nnausea, early satiety, and intestinal obstruction  (see the NCCN Guidelines \nfor Adult Cancer Pain, available at www.NCCN.org ).11,21,38 The diagnosis \nof PeM may be delayed, because PeM mimics other diseases and \nconditions and because the disease is so rare .11,24,38  \nTo diagnose PeM , initial evaluations include CT imaging of the \nchest/abdomen/pelvis and l aparoscopy  to obtain a biopsy of the \nabdominal mass/nodule(s).  On CT, diffuse distribution in the abdomen and \nthe absence of lymph nodes or distant metastases suggest  PeM; however, \nthere are no specific imaging findings for PeM .24,41,42 Laparoscopy is also PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:41 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Peritoneal   \n \nMS-4 done to assess whether complete  CRS  is possible.24 Fine- needle \naspiration (FNA) of the nodule/mass is  not recommended for diagnosis , \nbecause FNA cannot differentiate between the different histologic \nsubtypes of PeM including epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and biphasic . Using  \nparacentesis fluid (cytology) is  also not recommended for diagnosis  \nbecause invasion cannot be detected using cytology .21,24 Measurement of \nsoluble mesothelin- related peptide (SMRP) and CA -125 levels may be \nconsidered, and these levels may correlate with disease status . For \npatients suspected of having PeM , the NCCN Guidelines for \nMesothelioma: Peritoneal recommend an initial  evaluation including : 1) CT \nwith contrast  of the chest , abdom en, and pelvis ; 2) biopsies of the \nnodule/mass using a midline laparoscopy; and 3) serum markers.21,42,43  \nPathology  \nTissue biopsy of the abdominal mass/nodule(s) with histopathology is \nessential for an accurate diagnosis of PeM , because symptoms, imaging \nfindings, and serum markers are not specific. Patients may have benign and preinvasive mesothelial tumors such as peritoneal inclusion cyst , \nwell-differentiate d papillary  mesothelial tumor (WDPMT) , or mesothelioma \nin situ.\n44-46 Peritoneal inclusion cyst  is very rare ; it was previously termed \nbenign multicystic PeM  but was revised based on the recent WHO \nclassification .47-49 Diffuse PeM is malignant and further divided into specific \nhistologic subtypes, including epithelioid, sarcomatoid, or biphasic \nhistology (epithelioid and sarcomatoid histology , also known as mixed ).17,50 \nUnless otherwise indicated, these PeM guidelines refer to diffuse PeM , \nbecause most patients have diffuse mesothelioma. Although localized \npleural mesothelioma may occur, it is very rare; localized PeM is \nextremely rare .33,51 -53 Accurate histology is essential , because the \ntreatment options depend on histology.  Patients with an epithelioid \nsubtype have longer median overall survival ( 39 months) compared to \npatients who have a biphasic subtype ( 14 months).15 However, median \nsurvival is improved if patients are able to undergo cytoreductive surgery (55 months for epithelial histology vs.13 months for biphasic).54 It is \nimportant  to distinguish diffuse PeM from peritoneal inclusion cyst  and \nWDPMT  because treatment options differ ; it is also important to \ndistinguish PeM from metastatic carcinomas such as breast,  \ngastrointestinal, liver, lung, ovarian,  pancreatic , and renal cell (see \nPrinciples of Pathologic Review  in the algorithm).55 The differential \ndiagnosis of PeM includes peritoneal carcinomatosis , serous peritoneal \ncarcinoma, tuberculous peritonitis, and alcoholic cirrhosis.24,56  \nDetailed information about the pathologic evaluation of PeM  is provided in \nthe algorithm and summarized here (see Principles of Pathologic Review) . \nBecause PeM and pleural mesothelioma are similar, the pathology section \nalso contains content about pleural mesothelioma. The  classification for \npleural mesothelioma was revised based on new recommendations from \nthe World Health Organization ( WHO ).39,57 The classification for PeM has \nalso been revised. The term malignant  is no longer used to classify \nmesotheliomas, because all mesotheliomas are now defined as \nmalignant.39 \nHistologic assessment and immunohistochemistry (IHC)  are the main tools \nused in the diagnosis of diffuse PeM ; however , cytogenetics and \nmolecular techniques  are also used . For a diagnosis of mesothelioma, the \nlesion needs to be diffuse, mesothelial, and malignant. There is no single IHC marker to diagnose PeM. Different IHC markers need to be used to \ndistinguish PeMs from other carcinomas, such as gynecologic \nmalignancies or renal cell carcinomas.  A panel of markers is \nrecommended as follows : 1) two mesothelial markers (ie, positive \nmarkers), including c alretinin and podoplanin ( D2-40); and 2) two \ncarcinoma markers (ie, negative markers) including claudin 4, thyroid \ntranscription factor 1 ( TTF-1), polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),  \nand paired box gene 8 (PAX8) .\n17,50,58- 64 Although PAX8 is a carcinoma \nmarker, sometimes PeM s will stain for PAX8.17,65 Wilms tumor protein 1 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:41 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Peritoneal   \n \nMS-5 (WT-1) is generally positive for PeM ; however , it is also positive for \npapillary serous carcinoma.63 For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN \nPanel deleted WT -1 and added PAX8 for the differential diagnosis of PeM . \nIt is important to note that IHC markers for diagnosing PeM  differ slightly \nfrom those for diagnosing pleural mesothelioma. For example, TTF- 1 and \nD2-40 are not useful for diagnosing PeM , although they are useful for \ndiagnosing pleural mesothelioma.17  \nBAP1  IHC loss is a molecular marker that is useful for diagnosing \nmesothelioma , especially mesothelioma in situ, which is difficult to \ndiagnose.11,66- 71 BAP1  is a tumor suppressor gene involved in \nmesothelioma and other carcinomas. Recurrent somatic and/or germline \nmutations in BAP1  occur in mesothelioma.11,71Aberrant BAP1 protein \nexpression, which is defined as absence of nuclear BAP1 IHC staining, \noccurs in about 50% to 70% of patients with epithelioid mesothelioma but \nin less than 20% of those with sarcomatoid mesothelioma.72 BAP1 IHC is \nuseful for distinguishing mesotheliomas from benign mesothelial tumors . \nFor the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel clarified that complete \nabsence of expression or cytoplasmic staining is considered a loss of \nBAP1 expression. Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase ( MTAP)  IHC is \nanother molecular marker that is useful for diagnosing pleural \nmesotheliomas. Cytoplasmic loss of MTAP IHC is used to quickly assess  \nthe presence of  cyclin -dependent kinase inhibitor 2A ( CDKN2A ) deletions , \nwhich can be m easured by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ). \nHowever, fewer patients  with PeMs have CDKN2A  deletions (8%–35%) \ncompared with patients with pleural mesotheliomas (60% –74%) .40,66,67,73  \nManagement   \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Mesothelioma: Peritoneal recommend that \npatients with PeM should have their treatment managed  by a \nmultidisciplinary team with experienc e in PeM .12,21 Treatment options for \npatients with diffuse PeM include surgery  and/or systemic therapy .21,74 Select patients with medically operable diffuse PeM and good \nperformance status (PS) are candidates for multimodality therapy , \nincluding those with epithelioid histology and unicavitary disease . \nSystemic therapy is recommended for patients with diffuse PeM who are \nnot eligible for or refuse surgery. Best supportive care is recommended \nfor patients with a PS of 3 to 4 (see Principles of Supportive Care  in the \nalgorithm) . Radiation therapy is not recommended as a primary therapy \nfor PeM but can be used selectively for palliation. T reatment options for \npatients with peritoneal inclusion cyst  or WDPMT  include: 1) observation \nwith imaging surveillance for those with asymptomatic and noninvasive \ndisease ; or 2) CRS with or without HIPEC for those who have \nsymptomatic, recurrent, or microinvasive disease.   \nThere are no phase 3 randomized trials to determine the best treatment \nfor patients with PeM because it is so rare, although there are a few \nclinical trials.13,14,75- 77 Because PeM and pleural mesothelioma  are \nsimilar, systemic therapy recommendations for PeM  are based on \nextrapolating data from clinical trials in pleural mesothelioma; \nrecommendations are also based on clinical trials in PeM, and on the \nexpertise of the panel members (see Surgery  and Intraperitoneal \nChemotherapy  and Systemic Therapy  in this Discussion).21  \nSurgery and Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy  \nData show good outcomes for eligible patients with PeM  who have CRS \nand intraperitoneal chemotherapy  (see Clinical Trials  in this \nDiscussion) .13,14,59,75 -77 Therefore, a multidisciplinary evaluation is \nrecommended to assess whether patients are eligible for surgery. During \nlaparoscopic biopsy, a surgical evaluation is done to assess whether \npatients are candidates for surgery. After a diagnosis of diffuse PeM , \nPET/CT is done to determine whether patients have unicavitary or bicavitary disease. Surgery is typically contraindicated in patients with \nbicavitary disease and those with biphasic or sarcomatoid histology; PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:41 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Peritoneal   \n \nMS-6 however, surgery may be considered in select patients with bicavitary \ndisease or low -volume biphasic disease (see Principles of Surgery  in the \nalgorithm).78 It is essential that patients receive a careful assessment \nbefore surgery is performed.  Complete cytoreduction is recommended for \neligible patients with epithelioid histology and unicavitary PeM  who are \nmedically operable.21,74,76,79  \nThe surgical goal for PeM  is CRS to achieve macroscopic complete \nresection by removing all visible or palpable tumors, which frequently \ninvolves a total parietal peritonectomy (see Principles of Surgery  in the \nalgorithm). If macroscopic complete resection or near complete cytoreduction is not possible, then surgery should be aborted. Palliative \nsurgery and/or HIPEC can be considered but only if there will be minimal \nmorbidity. There is no accepted staging system for PeM. The peritoneal \ncancer index scoring system is used to indi cate the severity of the \nsymptom burden (see Principles of Surgery  in the algorithm).\n74 A \ncompleteness of cytoreduction score of zero (CC -0) indicates that there is \nno residual disease (see Principles of Surgery  in the algorithm).80 A novel \nstaging system based on the peritoneal carcinomatosis index is \navailable.81  \nClinical Trials  \nA multi -institutional study assessed CRS and HIPEC in 401 patients with \nPeM; 46% had complete or near -complete cytoreduction and 92% \nreceived HIPEC.76 The median overall survival was 53 months (1– 235 \nmonths); 3- year and 5- year survival rates were 60% and 47%, \nrespectively. Grade 3– 4 complications occurred in 127 patients ( 31%); 9 \npatients died perioperatively. A meta- analysis assessed CRS  and \nintraperitoneal chemotherapy  in 1047 patients with PeM.16 Complete \ncytoreduction was done in 67% of patients (46% –93%). Survival \nestimates were 84% at 1 year, 59% at 3 years, and 42% at 5 years.   In a single institution study, 108 patients with PeM  had CRS  and HIPEC \nwith cisplatin and either doxorubicin or mitomycin -C.77 The median overall \nsurvival was 63.2 months (95% CI, 29.6– 96.7). Nineteen patients survived \nmore than 7 years and appeared to be cured. Major morbidity was 38.9%; \ntwo patients died perioperatively. In another single institution study, 84 \npatients with PeM  had CRS  and HIPEC with cisplatin  plus doxorubicin; 66 \npatients had complete or near complete cytoreduction.14 Almost all \npatients had epithelioid histology (97.6%). The median overall survival was 38.4 months (95% CI, 23.6– 54.3); 5- year survival was 42%. Grade 3– 4 \ncomplications occurred in 22 patients (26.2%); acute kidney injury occurred in 30 patients (35.7%). Three patients died perioperatively.  \nA retrospective study (Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group International) assessed CRS and HIPEC in 34 patients with MPEM and biphasic \nhistology ; 5-year survival was 50.2% (median, 6.8 years ) for those who \nhad a complete resection (CC -0).\n78 Five-year survival was 41.6%  (median, \n2.8 years ) for those who had incomplete CC -1 resections . Median survival \nwas only 4.3 months in those who had incomplete CC -2 resections.   \nNCCN Recommendations \nThe NCCN Panel recommends CRS and HIPEC for eligible patients with \nPeM based on trials for PeM  and pleural mesothelioma (see Principles of \nSurgery  and Principles of Systemic Therapy in the algorithm).21,74 \nAppropriate patients should be evaluated by surgeons, medical \noncologists, and diagnostic imaging specialists  to assess if they are \ncandidates for multimodality treatment.  \nComplete cytoreduction and HIPEC  are recommended for patients with \nunicavitary PeM and epithelioid histology who are medically operable if a \ncomplete cytoreduction is achievable. Perioperative systemic therapy \nshould be considered if patients have high- risk features (such as Ki -67 \n>9%, nodal metastases, high tumor burden [peritoneal cancer index >17]), CC > 1, biphasic disease , or bicavitary disease).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Peritoneal   \n \nMS-7 Ki-67 index is not routinely recommended at diagnosis, it may be useful for \nhelping to define high- risk features. After perioperative therapy, patients \nmay be eligible for CRS and HIPEC. Systemic therapy alone is \nrecommended for patients  with PS 0 to 2 who are medically inoperable or \nrefuse surgery (see Systemic Therapy  in this Discussion) .  \nThe NCCN Panel has preference stratified the intraperitoneal \nchemotherapy regimens and voted that the following regimens are \npreferred: 1) cisplatin plus doxorubicin; 2) cisplatin; 3) carboplatin; or 4) \ncisplatin  plus mitomycin (see Principles of Surgery  in the \nalgorithm).74,77,82 -84 The panel has voted that monotherapy mitomycin \nregimens are useful in certain circumstances.74  \nSystemic Therapy  \nOnly a few systemic therapy clinical trials have been done for patients with \nPeM who are not eligible for surgery.7,85- 89 Therefore, recommended \nsystemic therapy regimens for PeM  are mainly based on clinical trials \ndone in patients with pleural mesothelioma ; the NCCN Panel has decided \nthat these regimens are equally efficacious for both disease sites (see Principles of Systemic Therapy  in the algorithm) .\n21,74,85,89 Details  about the \nsystemic therapy clinical trials for pleural mesothelioma are described  in \nthe Discussion for pleural mesothelioma (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nMesothelioma : Pleural , available at www.NCCN.org ). For the 2023 update \n(Version 1), the NCCN Panel reorganized the systemic therapy recommendations based on histology and line of therapy.  All of the \nregimens recommended for PeM and pleural mesothelioma may also be \nused for eligible patients with pericardial mesothelioma and tunica \nvaginalis testis mesothelioma, which are extremely rare cancers.\n90,91  \nClinical Trials  \nThe International Expanded Access Program (EAP) assessed pemetrexed \nregimens in patients with mesothelioma who were not eligible for surgery.92-94 A subset of 98 patients with PeM  received pemetrexed \nregimens.86 Median survival was not reached for patients receiving \nfirst-line therapy with either pemetrexed alone or pemetrexed plus \ncisplatin; response rates were 25%. Median survival was 13.1 months for \npatients with PeM  receiving second- line therapy with either pemetrexed \nalone or pemetrexed  plus cisplatin; response rates were 23.3%. Updated \nresults from the EAP were published for 109 patients with PeM  receiving \npemetrexed regimens who were not eligible for surgery.7 Patients received \npemetrexed, pemetrexed  plus cisplatin, or pemetrexed plus carboplatin as \neither first -line or second -line therapy. For pemetrexed plus cisplatin, \n1-year survival was 57.4% (95% CI, 10.3% –100%). For patients receiving \npemetrexed alone, median survival was 10.3 months; 1- year survival was \n41.5% (95% CI, 4.6% –78.4%). Survival rates are not available for \npemetrexed plus carboplatin. The most frequent grade 3– 4 adverse event \nwas neutropenia (34.6%).  \nSeveral small studies done in Japan assessed pemetrexed regimens in \npatients with PeM . One study assessed first -line therapy with pemetrexed \nplus cisplatin in 24 patients with PeM .95 There were two complete \nresponses and nine partial responses. Median overall survival was 15.8 \nmonths . Another study assessed first -line therapy with pemetrexed plus \ncisplatin in 29 patients with PeM.89 Median overall survival was 15.4 \nmonths (95% CI, 9.5– 21.2). Grade 3– 4 adverse events included \nleukopenia (21%), neutropenia (17%), anemia (14%), and \nthrombocytopenia (3%). Updated results were reported from this group in \n54 patients with PeM  who received first -line therapy with pemetrexed  plus \nplatinum.87 Median overall survival was 16.6 months. This study also \nassessed second- line therapy in 26 patients with PeM.87 Patients received \ngemcitabine (12), taxane (6), nivolumab (3), and other agents (5). Median \noverall survival was 16.9 months.

The median age was 63 years. Most patients had epithelioid histology (90%); 10% had biphasic histology. \nOne patient had previously received bevacizumab.

Grade 3 treatment -emergent adverse events occurred in \n50% of patients (10/20) including hypertension (40%) and anemia (10%). \nGrade 3 immune -related adverse events —pancr eatitis and \nthrombocytopenia—occurred in 2 patients (10%), which required stopping treatment.   \nA cohort study assessed subsequent therapy with immune checkpoint \ninhibitors (ICIs) in 29 patients with PeM .\n100 Most patients had received one \nline of therapy (83%, 24/29). Many patients received subsequent therapy \nwith nivolumab plus ipilimumab (69%, 20/29); some patients received \nsingle -agent ICIs (31%, 9/29), including nivolumab (n=4), pembrolizumab \n(n=3), or atezolizumab (n=2). The overall response rate was 19% (5/26; \n95% CI, 6.6% –39%). Patients responded to ICIs regardless of whether \nthey had responded to previous platinum -based chemotherapy. The \nmedian duration of overall survival was 19 months (95% CI, 7.4– 43). The \n1-year overall survival rate was 68% (95% CI, 45% -83%). Five patients \n(17%) had moderate or severe side effects, including edema and \nincreased creatinine levels.  \nCONFIRM, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed nivolumab (67%) \nversus placebo (33%) in 332 patients with pleural mesothelioma who had \nprogressed after platinum -based chemotherapy.88 Most patients had pleural mesothelioma (95%) and epithelioid histology (88%); a few \npatients had PeM (n = 16). Many patients had received third -line therapy \n(56%). Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI, 8.5– 12.1) in \npatients receiving nivolumab versus 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.0 –8.0) in \nthose receiving placebo (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 –0.91). Grade 3 or \nworse adverse events were reported in 3%  of patients receiving \nnivolumab (diarrhea and infusion -related reaction, 6/221).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Peritoneal   \n \nMS-10 longer used to classify mesotheliomas, because all mesotheliomas are \nnow defined as malignant.39 The classification for pleural mesothelioma \nwas revised based on new recommendations from the World Health \nOrganization (WHO).39,57 The classification for PeM  has also been revised. \nA new abbreviations list was also added to the guidelines.   \nMesothelioma is a rare cancer originating in mesothelial surfaces of the \nperitoneum (15%), pleura (85%), and other sites that is estimated to occur \nin approximately 3500 people in the United States every year.1-4 It is \nestimated that PeM occurs in approximately 300 to 400 people in the \nUnited States every year.10 The mean age is about 69 years at diagnosis \nof PeM. One -year overall survival is approximately 46% in patients with \nPeM, and 5 -year overall survival is about 20%; cure is rare.2,11,121 -124  \nPatients with PeM  present with abdominal signs and symptoms, such as \npain, distension, ascites, and an abdominal mass.11,38 Patients with PeM  \noften have a high symptom burden compared with patients who have \nother types of cancer. The diagnosis of PeM  may be delayed, because \nsymptoms are nonspecific.11,24,38 Thus, many patients have advanced \ndisease at diagnosis .11 Although PeM can spread extensively in the \nabdomen, it rarely metastasizes beyond the abdominal cavity.24 For the \n2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel revised the pathology  section to \ninclude new information about markers used to identify PeM , which is \ndifficult to diagnose and has distinct molecular features when compared \nwith pleural mesothelioma (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the \nalgorithm) .40 There is no single IHC marker to diagnose PeM . Different \nIHC markers need to be used to distinguish PeM s from other carcinomas, such as gynecologic  malignancies or renal cell carcinomas.  A panel of \nmarkers is recommended as follows : 1) two mesothelial markers (ie, \npositive markers), including c alretinin and podoplanin ( D2-40); and 2) two \ncarcinoma markers (ie, negative markers) including claudin 4, TTF- 1, \npolyclonal CEA, and PAX8.17,50,58- 64 Although PAX8 is a carcinoma marker, \nsometimes PeMs will stain for PAX8.17,65 WT-1 is generally positive for \nPeM; however, it is also positive for papillary serous carcinoma.63 For the \n2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel deleted WT- 1 and added PAX8 \nfor the differential diagnosis of PeM .  \nData show good outcomes for eligible patients with PeM  who have CRS \nand intraperitoneal chemotherapy.13,14,75 -77 Therefore, a multidisciplinary \nevaluation is recommended to assess whether patients are eligible for \nsurgery. There are multiple intravenous systemic therapy options for \npatients who are not candidates for CRS, or whose disease recurs \nfollowing CRS with or without HIPE C. Recommended systemic therapy \nregimens for PeM are mainly based on clinical trials done in patients with \npleural mesothelioma; the NCCN Panel has decided that these regimens \nare equally efficacious for both disease sites .21,74,89 Details  about the \nsystemic therapy clinical trials for pleural mesothelioma are described  in \nthe discussion for pleural mesothelioma (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nMesothelioma: Pleural, available at www.NCCN.org ). For the 2023 update \n(Version 1), the NCCN Panel reorganized the systemic therapy \nrecommendations for PeM based on histology and line of therapy.  The \nNCCN Panel also clarified that atezolizumab plus bevacizumab should \nonly be considered as a subsequent therapy option for patients with PeM  if \nthey have not previously been treated with ICIs.
