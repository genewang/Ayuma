See NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology .\n• Modification of treatment should be considered if hematologic (biochemical) response is < very good partial response (VGPR) by cycle 3 or < \npartial response (PR) by cycle 2 of initial therapy, or no complete response (CR) and persistent organ dysfunction.1\n• Typically, light-chain normalization precedes organ response. \n• For SLCA with an underlying lymphoplasmacytic clone, treat underlying Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM)/lymphoplasmacytic \nlymphoma (LPL) as outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for Waldenström Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma.\nSupportive Care\n• There are several supportive care measures that should be considered. See Table 1 in Maroun BZ, et al. Blood Res 2022;57:106-116.\nScreening and Prophylaxis Recommendations  \n• Screen for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, as clinically indicated.\n• Recommend herpes zoster prophylaxis for patients treated with proteasome inhibitors or Daratumumab.\nSide Effects and Lab Tests\n• Regimens containing Bortezomib are associated with a higher risk of treatment-related peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, especially in \nthose with disease-related baseline neuropathy. Close monitoring or alternative therapies should be considered in some patients.\n• Carfilzomib can potentially cause cardiac and pulmonary toxicity, especially in older patients.\n• Treatment with immunomodulatory drugs is associated with transient elevation of cardiac biomarkers. Patients with cardiac amyloid should \nbe carefully monitored while on therapy with immunomodulatory drugs.  \n• For patients with cardiac amyloidosis or nephrotic syndrome who are taking corticosteroids, close monitoring for volume overload is \nnecessary. A dose reduction or elimination may be required.\n• Renal function should be continuously monitored while on Lenalidomide to ensure appropriate dosing.\n• Type and screen should be performed before using Daratumumab. Daratumumab may interfere with serologic testing and cause a false-\npositive indirect Coombs test.\n• Daratumumab can produce a false-positive serum immunofixation if the monoclonal protein is IgG kappa and special interference testing or \nMS-based assessment can differentiate between the two.\nDosing and Administration \n• Proteasome inhibitors: \n\u0017Subcutaneous Bortezomib is the preferred method of administration.\n\u0017Weekly dosing schedules of Bortezomib are recommended. \n\u0017Carfilzomib may be used once (preferred) or twice weekly and at different doses.\n\u0017For any regimen that includes Daratumumab, this could be Daratumumab for intravenous infusion or Daratumumab and Hyaluronidase-\nfihj for subcutaneous injection. Daratumumab and Hyaluronidase-fihj for subcutaneous injection has different dosing and administration \ninstructions compared to Daratumumab for intravenous injection.GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR SYSTEMIC THERAPY FOR SLCA  \nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:02 PM.

If there is underlying \nplasma cell clone, follow suggested therapies. For lymphoma or LPL, see NCCN \nGuidelines for Waldenström  Macroglobulinemia /Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma .\nd Stage IIIB patients were excluded at screening from the ANDROMEDA trial \naccording to the protocol. Retrospective trials have demonstrated acceptable \nefficacy and safety profile of Daratumumab/Cyclophosphamide/Bortezomib/\nDexamethasone in stage IIIb SLCA.\ne Dose modification and adjustments are mandatory in patients with advanced end \norgan damage (cardiac or other).\nf Dexamethasone dosing can be considered at the 20 mg weekly dose, per \nphysician discretion, in those who are >70 years of age, had underweight (body \nmass index <18.5), or had hypervolemia, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, \nor previous unacceptable side effects associated with glucocorticoid therapy. \nCyclophosphamide is capped at a 500 mg maximum weekly dose.\ng Dose reduce or discontinue Bortezomib if significant neuropathy. h Single-agent Daratumumab was given as maintenance therapy in the \nANDROMEDA trial.\ni Patients with single organ involvement, <10% marrow plasma cell involvement, \nand good performance status.\nj Lenalidomide therapy is associated with increased toxicities, particularly in newly \ndiagnosed patients with untested cardiac functional impairment. Lenalidomide \nshould not be used in patients with advanced heart or autonomic nerve \ninvolvement. Consider a lower starting dose (10–15 mg) of Lenalidomide in \npatients with SLCA than is used in multiple myeloma (MM) even in those with \nnormal renal function.

Also, consolidation treatment may be considered \nfor patients with VGPR or complete hematologic response with persistent minimal \nresidual disease and no organ response.\nl Patient must meet all criteria to receive Melphalan 200.m Multidisciplinary discussion of using Melphalan 200 for autologous HCT versus \nDaratumumab and Bortezomib-based induction regimen is recommended for this \npatient group.\nn Increased risk of acute kidney injury and end-stage renal disease during peri-\nautologous HCT period, can consider if on a stable chronic dialysis schedule.\n2 Sanchorawala V, Boccadoro M, Gertz M, et al.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 \nSystemic Light Chain Amyloidosis  \n \nMS-2 \nOverview \nPrimary systemic light chain amyloidosis (SLCA) , in contrast to multiple \nmyeloma , is typically character ized by a low burden of monoclonal \nplasma cells in the bone marrow. The abnormal plasma cells produce  \nlight chains that get converted to  amyloid fibrils  with an affinity for \nvisceral organs (such as the kidney, heart, g astrointestinal [GI] tract, \nliver, spleen, and nervous system) and cause end -organ dysfunction.1  \nMajor principles of management in SLCA are  to rapidly and sustainably \nreduce the production,  as well as harmful deposition,  of causative \namyloidogeni c amyloid fibrils through individualiz ed therapy bas ed on  \nthe extent of disease and organ involvement , type and the extent of \nsymptom burden , as well as anticipated treatment -related toxicity. \nThroughout the management, organ- specific  supportive care  is \nextended, preferentially in the context of experienced multidisciplinary \nsubspecialty care team s, to maximize  treatment efficacy, minimiz e \ndisease and treatment -related complications,  optimiz e quality of life , \nand ultimately recover the function of the affected organs  and reduc e \nthe risk of death.  \nAround 69% of newly diagnosed patients have more than one organ \ninvolved at the time of diagnosis.2 According to data from the U.S. \nclaims database, the incidence of amyloidosis seems to range from 9 to 14 cases per million person- years .\n3 Due to earlier diagnosis, newer \ntherapies that provide deeper responses, and better selection of candidate patients for autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) \nconsolidation, the early mortality rates (including transplant -related \nmortality) of patients  with SLCA have decreased , and survival has \nimproved.  Literature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice \nGuidelines (NCCN Guidelines®) for Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis , \nan electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature in SLCA,  using the following search terms: Systemic Light \nChain Amyloidosis and Amyloidosis. The PubMed database was chosen as it is the most widely used resource for medical literature and \nindexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature .\n4 \nThe search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to th e following article \ntypes:  Clinical Trial,  Phase II; Clinical Trial , Phase III ; Clinical Trial,  \nPhase IV;  Guideline;  Practice Guideline, Randomized Controlled Trial ; \nMeta -Analysis ; Systematic Reviews ; and Validation S tudies.   \nThe results of the PubMed search were examined for their potential \nrelevance. The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from \nadditional sources deemed as relevant to these g uidelines  and \ndiscussed by the P anel have been included in this version of the \nDiscussion section  (eg, e -publications ahead of print, meeting \nabstracts) . Any r ecommendations for which high- level evidence is  \nlacking are based on the P anel’s review of lower -level evidence and \nexpert opinion.  \nThe complete details of the D evelopment and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org .  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation.\n5 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to \nuse language that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -\nclassist, anti -misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and ant i-weight -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:02 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 \nSystemic Light Chain Amyloidosis  \n \nMS-3 \nbiased; and inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender \nidentities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, \ninstead focusing on organ- specific recommendations. This language is \nboth more accurate and more inclusive and can hel p fully address the \nneeds of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, \nand male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from \norganizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies \ndo not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these \nterms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate \ngender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is \npresumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN \nencourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their \nfuture analyses.  \nInitial Diagnostic Workup  \nThe workup of patients with suspected amyloidosis is geared towards \ndemonstration of the amyloid fibrils in tissue, identification of the protein \nof origin, and in the setting of light chain amyloidosis demonstration of the monoclonal plasma cell disorder. Subsequent workup is geared \ntowards identifying the organs involved and the severity of organ \ninvolvement and assessment of the feasibility and safety of different \ntreatment approaches.  \nClinical and Amyloid -Related Assessment  \nThe initial diagnostic workup includes a detailed history and physical (H&P) examination, evaluation of orthostatic vital signs, and careful \nevaluation for the pathognomonic signs of amyloidosis.  In the setting of \na monoclonal process, imaging with whole- body low -dose CT scan or \nFDG -PET/CT  can detect  osteolytic bone lesions . A skeletal survey is \nacceptable in certain circumstances (ie, limited access to health care resources), but it is significantly less sensitive than whole- body low -\ndose CT and FDG -PET/CT. If FDG -PET/CT or whole- body low -dose CT \nhas been performed, then a skeletal survey is not needed. \nElectrocardiogram (ECG)  may demonstrate low voltages and rhythm \nabnormalities , especially in the setting of cardiac amyloidosis . \nLaboratory Evaluation \nThe laboratory evaluation begins with a complete blood count (CBC) \nwith differential , including platelet counts , and peripheral blood smear . \nScreening for monoclonal protein by serum and urine protein \nelectrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP) alone may not be adequate, as it \ndoes not show a monoclonal spike in nearly 50% of cases. Therefore, \nserum immunofixation electrophoresis (SIPE) and 24- hour urine \nimmunofixation electrophoresis (UIPE) is essential along with s erum \nfree light chain (FLC) analysis . The measurement  of serum FLC is a \ndiagnostic necessity, as the majority of patients with light chain \namyloidosis will have abnormalities of the kappa or lambda chains with \nan abnormal  kappa/lambda ratio.6,7 \nTo assess organ involvement, t he workup should include urinalysis with \nquantification of proteinuria by 24 -hour urine collection and \nmeasurement of creatinine clearance  (calculated or measured directly) . \nFLCs are cleared by the kidney; therefore, renal insufficiency increases the concentrations of FLC. In that case, the kappa/lambda ratio or the \ndifference between involved and uninvolved FLCs should be monitored.\n6 Tests to assess renal function such as serum blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN) content  and serum creatinine, electrolytes, albumin, \ncalcium, serum uric acid, serum lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) , and \nbeta- 2 microglobulin are also recommended by the NCCN P anel.  \nRecommended l iver function evaluation tests  (LFTs)  include alkaline \nphosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine \naminotransferase (ALT), and bilirubin.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 \nSystemic Light Chain Amyloidosis  \n \nMS-4 \nprovide a quantitative assessment of cardiac dysfunction (troponin I or \nT), and cardiac stress brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N -terminal \nprohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT -proBNP) are important \npredictors of outcome in amyloidosis as well as part of the cardiac \nresponse criteria.8,9 BNP evaluation can be performed if NT -proBNP \nassessment is unavailable. Similar ly, if troponin T (TnT)  is unavailable, \nthen troponin I is acceptable.  A lipid panel is also recommended.  \nThe Panel recommends comprehensive coagulation studies if  indicated , \nincluding prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin (PTT), and \nFactor X.  Patients with SLCA  are at risk of developing acquired factor X \ndeficiency due to binding of factor  X to amyloid fibrils.10-12 This \ndeficiency typically responds to treatment of the underlying amyloidosis. \nTo determine if factor X is involved, prolonged thromboplastin time (PT) and activated prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) tests may be \nperformed. The amyloid deposits should be confirmed to be composed \nof light chains using immunohistochemistry or mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry for transthyretin or serum amyloid A component \nshould be performed if kappa and lambda stains are negative.  \nPathologic Evaluation  \nThe diagnosis of amyloidosis requires the identification of amyloid \ndeposits in tissues either by aspiration of abdominal subcutaneous fat \nand/or  biopsy of the organs involved. C haracterization of amyloidosis as \na systemic light chain type requires the demonstration of the underlying \nplasma cell clone\n. Therefore, i dentification of FLCs  in the serum or urine \nmust be followed by confirmation of amyloid in the tissue by pathologic evaluation.  \nCongo red staining of the subcutaneous fat aspirate is a reliable and \nnoninvasive test reported to identify amyloid deposits in approximately \n85% of patients.\n12-14 Amyloid deposits can be identified by bone marrow \naspiration and biopsy followed by Congo red staining. The monoclonal plasma cell population can be detected in bone marrow aspirates by \nimmunohistochemical staining of kappa and lambda chains. \nImmunohistochemistry for transthyretin or the serum  amyloid A \ncomponent should be performed if kappa and lambda stains are negative.  The stroma or blood vessels have been reported to be \npositive for amyloid in  60% of patients.\n15 Plasma cell fluorescence in \nsitu hybridization (FISH) studies can be performed on bone marrow \naspirates . FISH studies can be used to identify genetic aberrations, \nwhich can be prognostic in SCLA.16  \nIdentification of FLCs  in the serum or urine without confirmation of the \namyloid composition in tissue is not adequate,  as patients with other \nforms of amyloidosis may have an unrelated monoclonal gammopathy \nof undetermined significance ( MGUS ).17 Therefore , it is essential to \nconfirm that the amyloid deposits are composed of light chains by \nimmunohistochemical methods, electron microscopy, or mass \nspectrometry.18-20 Mass spectroscopy has a higher diagnostic accuracy \ncompared to immunohistochemistry in identifying the protein subunit  \nand is considered the gold standard to confirm light chain amyloid (AL) \nsubtype.21  \nIf fat pad aspirate and bone marrow biopsy are negative and \namyloidosis is still suspected, then the affected organs ( eg, kidney, \nliver, heart) should be evaluated.  \nA non- invasive nuclear imaging test, 99mTc -pyrophosphate (PYP) \nscan s can help distinguish cardiac involvement with AL from amyloid \ntransthyretin (ATTR ). In individuals with cardiac involvement from AL, a \nPYP scan is much less likely to be abnormal when compared to \nindividuals with ATTR.22,23 \nSince the treatment is different in the various types of amyloidosis, it is \nessential to confirm that patients have light chain amyloidosis (AL) PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:02 PM.

Transthoracic echocardiogram with global longitudinal \nstrain imaging is also an option in patients where CMR is not \nfeasible/optimal.  Low voltages and rhythm abnormalities can also be \ncaptured on ECG in individuals with cardiac amyloid involvement.  \nCardiovascular MRI has been successfully used for the diagnosis and \nprognosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy.24,25 Characteristic findings on \ncardiac MRI include global subendocardial late gadolinium \nenhancement (subendocardial or transmural involvement) with \nabnormal myocardial and blood- pool gadolinium kinetics.  When \nappropriate, imaging should be done with contrast unless contraindicated.  \nLiver and GI involvement may be confirmed by performing a gastric \nemptying scan if gastroparesis is present; and abdominal ultrasound or \nCT scan as clinically indicated to determine craniocaudal liver span . \nUpper and lower endoscopies  with random biopsies of suspected \naffected portions to confirm AL involvement of the GI tract can be \nextremely helpful in establishing the presence of deposits.  \nAn electromyogram (EMG) or nerve conduction testing can be \nperformed if the patient has significant peripheral neuropathy to confirm peripheral nervous system involvement.  Endocrine tests (thyroid- stimulating hormone and cortisol levels) and \npulmonary function tests may be performed if involvement of the \nendocrine system or lungs is suspected. Chest CT without contrast may \nbe performed,  if clinically  indicated.  \nLocalized Amyloidosis \nLocalized amyloidosis (LA) is a rare, self -limiting disorder , caused by \nthe production of immunoglobulin- free light chains locally from plasma \ncells or plasmacytic B -cells, typically affecting a single organ.26 Unlike \nSLCA, LA frequently has no circulating monoclonal immunoglobulin light \nchains. The m ost common organs affected in LA are the larynx, \ntrachea, lung, skin , or urinary tract, and account for  approximately  7% to \n12% of all amyloidosis diagnoses .26,27 Because of the confined nature of \nthis disorder, and low propensity to develop generalized involvement , \nindividuals with LA typically have an excellent prognosis  and overall \nsurvival (OS) comparabl e to that of the general population.26  \nIf LA is suspected, it should first be  confirmed by mass spectrometry . \nOnce confirmed, SPEP and SIFE, and UPEP and UIFE with 24 -hour \nurine collection are recommended as part of the workup. Serum FLC \nassay, ECG, echocardiogram, NT- proBNP, TnT, LFTs, renal function \nand urinalysis, and organ evaluation and imaging as clinically indicated \n(see Laboratory Evaluation above)  are also included as part of the initial \ndiagnostic workup.           \nIf monoclonal protein or isotypic light chain predominance is present \nand/or there is suspicion of other organ involvement, bone marrow and \ntissue biopsy with congo red staining and any identified amyloid deposit \nbe subjected to liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry (LC -MS). \nImmunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence can be considered if mass spectrometry is not available. If clinically indicated,  biopsy of other \norgans can be considered.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 \nSystemic Light Chain Amyloidosis  \n \nMS-6 \nNewly Diagnosed SCLA below. If no systemic disease is found, long-\nterm follow -up is recommended. Surgical approaches can be \nconsidered for symptomatic or cosmetic reasons.  A retrospective case \nseries evaluated the efficacy of surgical management in localized \nlaryngeal amyloidosis in 18 patients.28 Eleven patients (61.1%) required \nsurgical intervention due to progression, dysphonia/aphonia, dyspnea, \ndysphagia,  and to rule out malignancy . No patients developed systemic \namyloidosis.   \nIf monoclonal protein or isotypic light chain predominance is absent and \nthere is no suspicion of other organ involvement, patients can be \nfollowed as clinically indicated due to low risk of progression. However, \nif there is lymph node involvement, evaluation for low grade B -cell \nlymphoma can be considered (marginal zone lymphoma,  mucosa -\nassociated lymphoid tissue [MALT ] lymphoma, Waldenström \nmacroglobulinemia, or l ymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) . See the NCCN \nGuidelines for B -Cell Lymphomas  and NCCN Guidelines for \nWaldenström Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma \n(available at www.NCCN.org ). Long- term follow -up is also required.     \nCardiac Amyloidosis \nIf cardiac amyloidosis is suspected, workup includes SPEP and SIFE, \nUPEP and UIFE with 24- hour urine collection. Imaging techniques for \ncardiac involvement should also be included as well as cardiac \nbiomarkers discussed in the Laboratory Evaluation section above.   \nIf CMR is suspicious for cardiac amyloidosis and monoclonal protein is  \npresent, bone marrow and tissue biopsy with or without other organ \nbiopsy with congo red staining and LC -MS on any identified amyloid \ndeposit should be performed. If results indicate SLCA , treat accordingly. \nIf results are negative for SLCA , a cardiac biopsy is warranted.29 If no \nmonoclonal protein is  present, the NCCN Panel recommends cardiac scintigraphy with either PYP  scintigraphy 123I -MIBG, or 99mTC -DPD \nfollowed by treatment according to  semiquantitative grade.30  \nIf CMR is not suspicious for cardiac amyloidosis  and monoclonal protein \nis present with other signs of SLCA, a bone marrow and fat pad biopsy \nwith or without other organ biopsy with congo red staining and LC -MS \nshould be performed. If systemic signs of amyloidosis are not present, the patient should be worked up for other diagnoses such as \nmonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), \nsmoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) , or multiple myeloma (MM) . See \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Multiple Myeloma  (avai lable at \nwww.NCCN.org ). If no monoclonal protein is present, other causes of \ncardiac disease should be investigated.                                                                     \nStaging \nWhile multiple prognostic models have been proposed for patients with \namyloidosis, the NCCN Panel recommends us ing the Mayo 2012 \nStaging System or the Mayo 2004 Staging System with European Modifications.\n31,32 The Mayo 2012 Staging System  incorporates NT-\nproBNP ≥1800 ng/L (or BNP ≥400 ng/L), cTnT ≥0.025 µ/L (or cardiac \ntroponin I  [cTnI] ≥ 0.1 µ/L  or high- sensitivity cTnT [hs -cTnT] ≥40 pg/mL ), \nand the difference between involved and uninvolved serum free light chains (dFLC) ≥18 mg/dL as risk factors.\n31,33  \nPatients with no risk factors are classified as stage I, those with one \nelevated risk factor as s tage II, those with two elevated risk factors as \nstage III , and those with three elevated risk factors as stage IV. For \npatients classified as having stage I, II, III, or IV disease, the median OS \nfrom diagnosis i s 94, 40, 14, and 6 months, respectively.31   \nThe Mayo 2004 Staging System with European Modifications is similar \nto the Mayo 2012 Staging System, however, does not include dFLC.32 \nSome of the risk factor values also vary slightly, including cTNT ≥0.035 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:02 PM.

The NCCN P anel members \nrecommend that treatm ent of SLCA should be in the context of a clinical \ntrial when possible because data are insufficient to identify optimal \ntreatment of the underlying plasma cell disorder.  \nAll current strategies include systemic therapy to destroy the plasma \ncells responsible for the synthesis of immunoglobulin light chains. \nSeveral active regimens are available for the treatment of SLCA.  Most \nare derived from the treatment of multiple myeloma. The goals of \ntherapy include eliminating the misfolded amyloid light chains as \npromptly as possible, minimizing treatment toxicity, and supporting the \nfunction of the damaged organs.  The consensus criteria for hematologic \nand organ response were  updated at the 12th International Symposium \non Amyloidosis.35  \nThe preferred primary treatment for patients with SLCA is in a clinical \ntrial, and participation in clinical trials should be encouraged.  \nPrimary Therapy for SLCA  \nPreferred Regimen s for Primary Treatment of SLCA  \nDaratumumab in Combination with \nBortezomib/ Cyclophosphamide/ Dexamethasone  \nFor Mayo 2004  stages I –IIIa, with no significant neuropathy, data \nsupporting the use of this regimen come from a phase 3 trial \n(ANDROMEDA) in which patients (n = 388) with newly diagnosed \namyloidosis were randomized to receive six cycles of \ncyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone ( CyBorD) with or \nwithout  subcutaneous daratumumab (daratumumab and \nhyaluronidase).41,42 \nThose receiving subcutaneous daratumumab as part of their regimen \nreceived single- agent daratumumab monthly as maintenance therapy PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:02 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 \nSystemic Light Chain Amyloidosis  \n \nMS-8 \nfor up to 2 years. After a median follow -up of 11.4 months, the addition \nof daratumumab to CyBorD resulted in higher rates of hematologic CR \n(53% vs. 18%), cardiac response (42% vs . 22%), and renal response \n(53% vs . 24%). The addition of daratumumab also delayed major organ \ndeterioration, hematologic progression, and death (hazard ratio [ HR], \n0.58; 95% CI , 0.36–0.93).42 The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse \nevents in the daratumumab arm compared with the control arm were \nlymphopenia (13.0% vs. 10.1%), pneumonia (7.8% vs . 4.3%), cardiac \nfailure (6.2% vs.  4.8%), and diarrhea (5.7% vs.  3.7%).42 The U .S. Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this regimen for patients \nwith SLCA.  \nThe NCCN P anel has included  daratumumab in combination with \nCyBorD as a category 1, preferred therapy option for patients with stage \nI-IIIa SLCA  and no significant neuropathy . For patients with significant \nneuropathy, regardless of stage, this regimen is a category 2A, \npreferred option.  \nFor patients with no significant neuropathy and Mayo 2004 stage IIIb \ndisease, dose -modified daratumumab + CyBorD is a preferred regimen. \nBecause the ANDROMEDA trial excluded those with IIIb disease during the screening process, only retrospective trials are available for review. \nA multicenter retrospective cohort study evaluated the  outcomes of 19 \nindividuals with stage IIIb SLCA.\n43 Overall response rate was 100%, \nwith 17 patients achieving a very good partial response (VGPR) . At a \nmedian follow -up of 12 months , estimated overall survival was 67.5% \n(95% CI, 43.8– 84.7). \nAutologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant  \nThe role and timing of HCT for patients with AL amyloidosis is evolving, \nespecially with the availability of new systemic therapy options, \nincluding daratumumab -containing regimens. Careful patient selection \nis critical for the success of HCT in AL amyloidosis  due to the increased risk of treatment -related mortality from compromised organs from \namyloid deposits . Autologous HCT is a preferred option for  only \ncarefully selected patients  who meet all the following criteria: single \nvital organ involvement , <10% marrow plasma cell involvement, and \ngood performance status (PS).40 It is important to keep in mind notable \nexclusions for autologous HCT candidacy (see AMYL -B).40 Of note, the \nSWOG phase III, randomized study comparing CyBorD induction, \nfollowed by autologous HCT or CyBorD consolidation with daratumumab maintenance in individuals with newly diagnosed AL is \ncurrently recruiting participants. ( NCT06022939)  \nDaratumumab \nSingle agent daratumumab is a preferred option for patients with no \nsignificant neuropathy and stage IIIb disease.  Daratumumab may be \nadministered subcutaneously (daratumumab 1800 mg with \nhyaluronidase 30,000 units) or intravenously (daratumumab 16 mg/kg). \nSubcutaneous administration has fewer infusion- related reactions and a \nfaster administration time. S ingle -agent daratumumab has been  \nassociated with high rates of overall hematologic response (66.6% – \n90%).44-46 The t oxicity profile is similar to that seen in patients with \nmultiple myeloma ; however, the rates of  infection are more common in \npatients with SLCA.47  \nOral Melphalan/Dexamethasone (if ineligible for HCT)  \nThe melphalan/dexamethasone regimen has also been used in the \nmanagement of SLCA. It has shown promising results in patients with \nprimary amyloidosis who are ineligible for HCT. A small study reported \nhematologic response in 67% (n = 31) , and complete remission in 33% \n(n = 15) of patients treated with melphalan and high- dose \ndexamethasone in a median of 4.5 months.48 Improvement in organ \nfunction was seen in 48% (n = 22) of patients.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 \nSystemic Light Chain Amyloidosis  \n \nMS-9 \ndexamethasone was maintained in 70% of patients for up to 3 years, \nand survival at a median follow -up of 5 years was about 50%.49  \nA long- term follow- up study evaluated the hematologic response rates \nof oral melphalan with full -dose dexamethasone and an attenuated \ndexamethasone schedule.50 Of the 259 patients, 76% in the full -dose \ngroup (n = 119) had a hematologic response rate versus 51% in the \nattenuated- dose group. Median OS was 7.4 years and 20 months in the \nfull-dose and attenuated dose, respectively.  \nThe French Myeloma Collaborative Group compared melphalan and \ndexamethasone to high- dose melphalan followed by HCT in a \nrandomized trial and found no significant differences for hematologic or organ responses.\n51 With a longer follow -up, the authors found that \nneither survival nor remission duration were statistically different \nbetween melphalan and dexamethasone versus high- dose melphalan \nfollowed by HCT even after eliminating treatment -related mortality from \nthe HCT arm.50,52 The NCCN P anel has included oral \nmelphalan/dexamethasone as a preferred option for patients  with SLCA \nof all stages, and with significant neuropathy , who are not candidates \nfor HCT.  \nRegimens Useful in Certain Circumstances for Primary Treatment of \nSLCA  \nBortezomib/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone  \nThe CyBorD  regimen was reported to have high hematologic response \nrates and CR in two independent studies.53,54 In one study, 17 patients \n(including 10 who received  no prior therapy) treated with CyBorD \nachieved a hematologic response of 94% and a CR rate of 71%.53 The \nmedian duration of response was 22 months. Organ response was observed in 50% of the patients with renal involvement. Three patients \noriginally ineligible for autologous HCT became eligible after treatment with CyBorD.\n53 In another study, 43 patients (including 20 who received  \nno prior therapy) were treated with biweekly administration of CyBorD.54 \nThe hematologic response rate was 81.4% with a CR rate of 41.9%. A \nsmall retrospective study of patients newly diagnosed with systemic \namyloidosis and multiple myeloma treated with the CyBorD regimen \ncontaining subcutaneous bortezomib  reported a high response rate and \nminimal toxicity .55  \nA European collaborative study evaluated the efficacy of CyBorD as a \nfirst-line treatment for systemic amyloidosis in 230 patients using the \nMayo 2004 Staging System with European Modifications.32 Of the 201 \npatients with measurable disease, overall response was 77% in stage I \n(n = 30), 64% in stage II (n = 67), 69% in Stage IIIA (n = 61), and 42% \nin stage IIIB (n = 43). There was no significant difference in cumulative \nproportion survival between stage II and stage IIIA ( P = .613), however, \naverage survival of patients with stage IIIA disease was 7 months ( P < \n.001 when compared to stage I, II , and IIIA).  \nThe NCCN Panel has included CyBorD as a treatment option for individuals with no significant neuropathy and stages I –IIIa. Dose-\nmodified cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and  dexamethasone is an \noption for patients with no significant neuropathy and stage IIIb disease.  \nThis regimen is also an option if daratumumab is not available.  \nBortezomib/Melphalan/Dexamethasone (if ineligible for HCT)  \nCombining weekly bortezomib with melphalan in a small series of \npatients has yielded hematologic response rates of 94%.\n56 Bortezomib \nin combination with melphalan and dexamethasone was evaluated in a \nsmall phase II trial, and resulted in a best -response rate of over 80% \nand a CR rate of 42%.57  \nData supporting the use of this regimen are from a phase III trial of \npatients ineligible for transplant (n  = 109) with SLCA who were PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:02 PM.

Five -year OS was 32% (95% CI , 11.7–\n59.6)  and 3 participants (8%) died.  \nA phase 2 trial evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of lenalidomide in \nnewly diagnosed,  and previously treated,  patients  (n = 23)  with SLCA . 60 \nDexamethasone was added if no hematologic response was seen. Of \nthe patients who received lenalidomide/dexamethasone, a hematologic \nresponse rate of 75%  was achieved. The NCCN Panel recommends \nlenalidomide with dexamethasone as a primary treatment option in \npatients with SLCA  and significant neuropathy, regardless of stage. \nDose modification and adjustments are mandatory in patients with \nadvanced end organ damage (cardiac or renal ). Carfilzomib/Dexamethasone  \nCarfilzomib, a second- generation proteasome inhibitor (PI) may be used \nin combination with dexamethasone as a primary treatment option in \npatients with SLCA, regardless of stage, and in those with significant \nneuropathy. However, d ata on the use of carfilzomib as a primary \ntreatment option in SLCA is limited  and prospective data  is needed . A \nsmall cohort study of five patients with newly diagnosed SLCA , all of \nwhom had cardiac involvement and neuropathy, received IV carfilzomib \nand corticosteroids (methylpr ednisolone or dexamethasone) for a \nmedian number of three cycles.61 After one cycle, rapid hematological \nresponse was reported with an 80.6% reduction in median dFLC. Three \npatients achieved CR and VGPR was induced in the remaining two \npatients. No decline in cardiac function or worsening neuropathy was \nreported in any of the five patients.  \nTherapy for Previously Treated SLCA  \nThere are no clinical trial data to determine the appropriate regimens for \npreviously treated SLCA. T reatment depend s on prior therapy received, \npatient preferences, and toxicity profile. The NCCN P anel recommends \nconsidering repeating the initial therapy, especially if the patient has no \nrelapse of disease for several years.  \nBortezomib with or without Dexamethasone \nClinical studies have reported  bortezomib with or without \ndexamethasone to be active as primary treatment as well as for \nrelapsed amyloidosis .13,62- 64 \nIn a study comparing two doses of bortezomib, it was seen that \nbortezomib is well tolerated at doses up to 1.6 mg/m2 on a once- weekly \nschedule and 1.3 mg/m2 on a twice- weekly schedule.65 Although once-\nweekly and twice -weekly bortezomib were seen to be generally well \ntolerated , those on the once- weekly bortezomib regimen had lower PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:02 PM.

The overall response rate was 54%, with \na 31% CR rate .63  \nThe c ombination of bortezomib and dexamethasone was studied as \nconsolidation therapy in patients after HCT to see whether depth of response can be improved. At 24 months, greater than 60% had  a \npartial response ( PR), 40% had  a CR, and organ responses were seen \nin 70% of patients .\n67 The OS at 12 months was 88% and 82% at 24 \nmonths.67 \n \nIn the relapsed setting only, a small study of patients (n = 18) with \nrelapsed or progressive amyloidosis on prior therapies showed \nhematologic  response in 94% (n = 14) including CR in 44% (n = 7)68 \nwhen treated with bortezomib/dexamethasone. The  National \nAmyloidosis Center in Britain conducted a study of  patients (n = 20) with \nrelapsed or refractory SLCA treated with  bortezomib, and reported a \nhematologic response in 80% (n = 16) , of which 15% (n = 3) achieved a \nCR and 65% (n =  13) achieved a PR .62 In another  multicenter phase I/II \ndose- escalation study of bortezomib,  hematologic responses were seen \nin 50% of patients (15 out of 30 evaluable pretreated patients) with a \nCR rate of 20% (n = 6).69 \n The NCCN Panel recommends bortezomib with or without \ndexamethasone as a therapy option for previously treated disease.  \nBortezomib/ Cyclophosphamide/ Dexamethasone  \nStudies of CyBorD in patients with SLCA have included newly \ndiagnosed and relapsed/refractory patients.32,53,54  \n \nThe NCCN P anel notes that patients on regimens containing \nbortezomib are associated with a higher risk of treatment -related \nperipheral and autonomic neuropathy, especially in those with disease-\nrelated baseline neuropathy. Therefore, close monitoring, judicious \ndosing,  or alternative therapies should be considered in some patients . \nBortezomib/ Melphalan/ Dexamethasone  \nWhile bortezomib, melphalan and dexamethasone is recommended by \nthe NCCN Panel as a primary therapy option regardless of stage, it is \nalso included as a therapy option for previously treated disease.58 See \nPrimary Therapy for SLCA.  \nDaratumumab \nWhile s ingle -agent daratumumab is a preferred primary therapy option \nfor certain patients, the NCCN Panel also recommends it as an option \nfor patients  with previously treated disease  (if they have not received \ndaratumumab -based therapy as a primary treatment) . A retrospective \nanalysis evaluated the efficacy of daratumumab in 25 patients with \nSLCA who had received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy.44 Overall \nhematologic response rate was 76%, which included a CR and VGPR \nof 36% and 24%, respectively . Results also showed that daratumumab \nwas well tolerated, as only grade 1 and 2 infusion reactions were \nobserved.

The \nprimary objective was hematologic response, which was induced in \n63% of patients . Complete response and VGPR was achieved in 11.4%  \nand 37.1% of patients, respectively . Two-year PFS was 74% and OS \nwas 78% at median follow -up of 29.7 months. (NCT01864018)   \nIxazomib /Dexamethasone  \nA phase III trial (TOURMALINE -AL1) studied patients (n = 168) with \nrelapsed or refractory SLCA random ized to either \nixazomib/dexamethasone or to physician's choice of a non -proteasome \ninhibitor -containing regimen following 1 to 2 prior lines of therapy.71 \nHematologic response rate was the same, and occurred  in 53% of \npatients treated with ixazomib/dexamethasone and in 51% with \nphysician's choice ( P = .76). The CR rate was 26% with ixazomib \nversus 18% ( P = .22). Median time to vital organ deterioration or \nmortality was longer with ixazomib at 34.8 versus 26.1 months (HR , \n0.53; 95% CI, 0.32– 0.87; P = .01). Importantly, m edian treatment \nduration of patients treated with ixazomib was longer at 11.7 versus 5.0 \nmonths. Adverse events included diarrhea (34% vs. 30 %), rash (33% \nvs. 20%), cardiac arrhythmias (26% vs. 15%), and nausea (24% vs. \n14%).  \nIxazomib/ Lenalidomide/ Dexamethasone  \nA phase I/II trial evaluated the outcomes of patients (n = 40) with \nrelapsed SLCA treated with ixazomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone. \nHematologic responses were seen at 3 months in 57.9% of patients. \nMedian progression- free survival (PFS) was 17 months in the overall \nstudy patients. In those achieving CR/VGPR, the PFS was further improved to 28.8 months. Serious adverse events were infection (40%), \nfluid overload (33.3%), cardiac arrhythmia (13.3%), renal dysfunction \n(6.6%), and anemia (6.6%).72 \nLenalidomide/ Cyclophosphamide/ Dexamethasone  \nIn previously treated patients with relapsed SLCA , treatment with \nlenalidomide/ cyclophosphamide/ dexamethasone has been shown to \nproduce a response rate of 62%.73-75  \nLenalidomide/Dexamethasone  \nA retrospective analysis investigated the efficacy and toxicity  of \nlenalidomide and dexamethasone in a large cohort of patients (n = 260) \nwith relapsed/refractory SLCA.76 Participants had received an average \nof two prior lines of therapy  and after 3 months of treatment, \nhematological response rate was 31%. Median OS and hematologic event -free survival was 32 months and 9 months, respectively after \nfollow- up at 56.5 months.  \nThe results of another phase 2 trial (n = 34 and 91% of patients had \nprior therapy) demonstrated that the reduced dose of lenalidomide at 15 \nmg per day had acceptable toxicity and good hematologic \nresponses.77 Of the 24 evaluable patients, reduced dose of \nlenalidomide along with dexamethasone showed an overall hematologic \nresponse rate of 67% (29% CR and 38% PR).77   \nIn a more recent study, p atients (n = 84) previously treated with \nthalidomide and/or bortezomib  were treated with lenalidomide and \ndexamethasone.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 \nSystemic Light Chain Amyloidosis  \n \nMS-13 \nHigh -Dose Melphalan Followed by HCT  \nHigh-dose melphalan followed by HCT is one of the therapeutic options \nlisted in the NCCN Guidelines for Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis® \n(available at www.NCCN.org ). This treatment modality is associated \nwith significant treatment -related mortality79-85; therefore , careful \nevaluation of patients who are potential candidates is key. The extent of \norgan involvement is considered a predictor of outcome.82,83,86 \nIn eligible patients, high- dose chemotherapy along with HCT  has been \nassociated with higher response rates and improved OS than standard chemotherapy.\n86 The best outcomes following HCT have been reported \nin patients who achieve a CR to high- dose primary chemotherapy ,87 \nincluding improvement of organ -related disease.88 The most significant \nindicator of treatment benefit is the depth of the response to therapy measured by the lowest  level of serum FLCs  post-transplantation .\n89 \nA number of groups have evaluated dose adjustment of high- dose \nmelphalan during a transplant based on factors such as age, number of organs involved,  and presence or absence of cardiac involvement.\n88,90,91 \nThe reported toxicity of reduced- dose melphalan is substantially less \nthan that of high- dose  melphalan.90 Older studies indicated that higher \ndoses of melphalan were  associated with a higher CR rate, and \nimproved OS and event -free survival , but these publications occurred \nduring an era where patients received transplant as primary therapy, and those receiving lower doses of melphalan typically had more \nadvanced AL, and thus were destined for inferior outcomes.\n92 Over the \npast decade, transplant -related mortality rates have decreased from \n40% to about 7%.93-95 \nA long- term single -center study of the outcomes of patients who \nunderwent treatment with high- dose melphalan followed by H CT \nreported survival of up to 20 years in 28.6% of patients.94 While the \nsurvival was strongly dependent on achievement of a hematologic CR, those who do not achieve a CR and /or who relapsed after CR also had \na survival benefit with HCT.77 \nMelphalan/Dexamethasone  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends melphalan and dexamethasone a s a \ntherapeutic option for previously treated disease. Data has shown CR \nrates ranging from 13% to 33% and average OS from 10.5 to 61.2 \nmonths.96 See Primary Therapy for SLCA .  \nPomalidomide/Dexamethasone  \nThe safety and efficacy of pomalidomide and dexamethasone w ere \nstudied in a  prospective phase II study .97 Patients with previously \ntreated SLCA (n = 33) were enrolled in the trial and upon treatment with \npomalidomide and dexamethasone, confirmed response was reported \nin 48% (n = 16) with a median time to response of 1.9 months . The \nmedian OS rate  was 28 months and PFS  rate was 14 months; the OS \nand PFS rates at 1 year were 76% and 59%, respectively.  \nUseful in Certain Circumstances for Previously Treated SLCA  \nBendamustine/Dexamethasone  \nBendamustine/dexamethasone is an option for patients who have \nreceived multiple prior regimens. A multicenter phase 2 trial \nevaluated this regimen in patients with persistent or progressive SLCA \nafter at least one prior therapy.98 Responses (PR or better) were seen in \n57% of patients. Seven out of 24 patients with organ involvement had \noverall organ response. The median PFS and OS were 11.3 months \nand 18.2 months, respectively. OS was better among those with a \nhematologic response.

Grade 3 \nor 4 adverse events occurred in 71% of patients with multiple cardiac \nevents, including hypotension, hypertension, decreased ejection \nfraction, and symptomatic ventricular tachycardia. Eleven patients had \nworsening of NT- proBNP on carfilzomib, with five  of those patients \ndeveloping progressive cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, the NCCN \nPanel has listed carfilzomib as an option for treatment of \nrelapsed/refractory SLCA in select patients wi th no cardiac involvement.  \nDaratumumab/Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone  \nA retrospective cohort study investigated the hematological and organ \nresponse of daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (DRd) in \n10 patients with multiple myeloma and concurrent SLCA.100 Eight \npatients were considered stage III or IV according to the Mayo 2012 staging system . Nine  patients had cardiac involvement , and three \npatients had renal amyloidosis . At 6 months, overall hematological \nresponse was 90%, with >50% achieving a VGPR.  Four of eight \npatients with a baseline BNP of ≥150 pg/ml  saw a >30% decrease. \nRenal response was induced in two of the three patients with \namyloidosis and kidney involvement . The NCCN Panel recommends \nDRd as a “Useful in Certain Circumstances” option for prev iously \ntreated disease and for those who did not receive a daratumumab -\nbased regimen as a primary therapy.  \nVenetoclax t(11;14) with or without  Dexamethasone  \nGiven the high prevalence of t(11;14) (~50%) and the efficacy of the \nbcl2 inhibitor venetoclax in t(11;14) myeloma, there has been interest in exploring this drug in AL. A multicenter, international, retrospective \ncohort study reported on outcomes of patients (n =  43) with \nrelapsed/refractory SLCA treated with venetoclax -containing \nregimens.101 The overall PFS and OS at 12 months w ere 78% and 93%, \nrespectively. However, in patients (n =  30) harboring t(11;14), median \nPFS and OS were not reached and 12 -month PFS and OS were 90% \nand 97%, respectively. In comparison, among  patients without  t(11;14)  \n(n = 11), 12- month PFS and OS were 45% and 82% , respectively.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2026 \nSystemic Light Chain Amyloidosis  \n \nMS-15 \nSummary  \nSuccessful management of SLCA remains a challenge due to delayed \nrecognition of patients who often experience significant lag  in timely \ndiagnosis. The clinical manifestations are diverse and diagnosing it \naccurately and at an early stage are key to improved outcomes. \nTreatment of patients with SLCA has improved significantly over the \nyears, and therapeutic options have expanded significantly with newer \ntherapies , which have demonstrated capability in inducing rapid and \ndeep responses , that in turn translate  into high rates of organ response. \nWhenever possible, patients should be evaluated in the context of \nexperienced amyloid multidisciplinary program s, and considered for  \nparticipation and  treatment  on clinical trials.
