Categorization of vaginal squamous \ncell carcinoma has been simplified into HPV-associated and HPV-independent types based upon pathogenesis. If association is unknown, \ninclusion of “not otherwise specified (NOS)” is recommended. Previously used terms, “warty ,” “basaloid,” “verrucous,” and “papillary,” are \nno longer necessary components of the histologic type.\n• HPV-independent squamous cell carcinomas of the vagina are much less common and are often seen in postmenopausal AFAB individuals \n(median age 73 years). These tumors are predominantly of the keratinizing type histology and demonstrate negative p16 and positive p53 \nimmunohistochemistry (IHC). As with HPV-associated vaginal carcinomas, prior history (<5 years) of cervical and vulvar carcinomas must be \nexcluded. \n• Other types of vaginal carcinomas are very rare and include: HPV-associated vaginal adenocarcinoma, endometrioid carcinoma, and \nclear cell carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma (gastric and intestinal types), mesonephric adenocarcinoma, carcinosarcoma, mixed tumor of \nthe vagina, adenocarcinoma of skene gland origin, adenosquamous carcinoma, adenoid basal carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinomas, \nadenosarcoma, and germ cell tumors.

The addition of brachytherapy to EBRT is preferred as the combination has been shown to improve control.\n• Overall treatment time should not extend beyond 8 weeks.\n• Treatment delays/interruptions need to be minimized.\nExternal Beam Radiation Therapy/Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (EBRT/IMRT)\n• Simulation\n\u0017IMRT\n ◊Simulate and treat supine, frog-legged with custom immobilization when including the groin, with full bladder. Consider bladder full and \nempty CT scans to generate vaginal internal organ motion (internal target volume [ITV]).\n ◊Consider oral and IV contrast.\n ◊Place markers at tumor for delineation and fuse with MRI/PET imaging (if available) to define tumor extent.\n ◊Consider placement of vaginal gel during MRI for additional delineation of intraluminal disease.\n• Dose Prescription\n\u0017IMRT\n ◊45–50 Gy in 1.8–2.0 Gy/fraction\n ◊For gross nodes, consider simultaneous integrated or sequential boost to 55–70 Gy equivalent dose at 2 Gy (EQD2).\n ◊If the primary lesion was resected surgically with close or positive margins and EBRT boost is planned, dose is 54–60 Gy to the \npostoperative bed. Alternatively a brachytherapy boost can be given.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

Account for \npossible ITV as vaginal apex can move up to 2 cm in anterior-posterior (AP) direction. To develop an ITV, patients should be simulated with \nfull and empty bladder. CTVs from both scans should be combined to create an ITV. If there is involvement of adjacent organs (ie, urethra \nor rectum), consider their inclusion in CTV.\n\u0017CTV nodes = Pelvic nodal coverage of common iliac, internal and external iliac, presacral, and obturator nodes, and if lower third of vagina \ninvolved include inguinal nodes. Include para-aortic nodes if common iliac/para-aortic nodes involved. Include pelvic vessels with 7-mm \nexpansion excluding bone/muscle/organs. Tumors involving the posterior vaginal wall and recto vaginal septum have an increased risk of \nspread to the presacral and mesorectal nodes; inclusion of the entire mesorectum should be considered in these cases.\n\u0017Inguinofemoral node borders for distal vaginal cases: superior = acetabular roof; lateral = inguinofemoral vessels to medial sartorius/\nrectus femoris; posterior = posterior border of vessels; medial = pectineus muscle or 2.5–3 cm from vessels; anterior = anterior border of \nsartorius; caudal = top of lesser trochanter of femur.\n\u0017Planning target volume (PTV) expansion 0.5–0.7 cm from CTV per institutional required margin to account for setup error based on image \nverification available.\n\u0017Inferior field border should extend approximately 3 cm below the inferior extent of vaginal disease.\n• Planning/Treatment\n\u0017EBRT\n ◊IMRT is used as a treatment technique to spare organs at risk (OAR). Attention should be given to internal target motion in planning. \n ◊Consider treatment with full bladder to minimize bowel dose.\n ◊A minimum of weekly portal images; daily image-guided RT (IGRT) is advised, especially if IMRT is utilized.\n ◊Bolus may be necessary to adequately cover inguinal nodes.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

For bulky or poorly responsive \ndisease in the upper vagina, dose escalation up to 85 Gy may be considered. Some treat entire vaginal surface to 60 Gy cumulative, \nfollowed by tumor boost to 70–80 Gy, while others treat only the lesion plus a margin. Careful attention should be paid to dose tolerance of \nvaginal mucosa. The distal vagina has a lower tolerance than the proximal vagina.\n\u0017For invasive cancers, common high dose-rate (HDR) fractionation regimens after 45 Gy to pelvis include 4.5–5.5 Gy x 5 fractions to the HR-\nCTV. Either less fractionated or more fractionated regimens may be used, such as 7 Gy x 3 fractions or 3 Gy x 9–10 fractions. Modulation of \ndose takes into consideration tumor location, extent of disease, response to EBRT, brachytherapy technique (intracavitary or interstitial), \nrelationship to surrounding OARs, as well as other factors.\n\u0017For very-early-stage vaginal cancers (<5 mm) not requiring EBRT, intracavitary brachytherapy alone may be used. Low dose-rate (LDR) data \nsuggest improved outcomes with doses of approximately 60–70 Gy EQD2 to the vaginal surface. The HDR data are more varied, with total \ndoses in the range of 50–60 Gy EQD2. The appropriate dose for each case needs to be individualized. Common regimens include 5 Gy x 8 \nfractions or 8 Gy x 5 fractions to the vaginal surface, with treatments delivered twice per week. \n• Dose Constraints: See (VAG-C 5 of 7)\n• Target Delineationa\n\u0017Brachytherapy planning is highly individualized and should incorporate information from pre-EBRT and pre-brachytherapy imaging \n(preferably MRI), clinical drawings, fiducials, and exam findings. Careful understanding of vaginal anatomy and distribution of disease is \nrequired. Image-guided brachytherapy is strongly encouraged, with adaptation of volumes as tumor responds. Tumor extent, location, and \nresponse must all be considered when choosing the brachytherapy approach.\n\u0017GTV: macroscopic gross residual tumor at time of brachytherapy by imaging and clinical exam\n\u0017HR-CTV: GTV + any abnormal/irregular vaginal wall within initial tumor extension + paravaginal/parametrial gray zones (if applicable)\n• Planning/Treatment\n\u0017IGRT adaptive planning encouraged\n\u0017Attention to vaginal surface dose and surrounding dose to OARs\n\u0017Use biologically effective dose (BED) dose conversions to track EQD2 dose to normal tissues (α/β ratio = 3) and to vaginal target/HR-CTV \n(α/β ratio = 10)\nReferencesContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

In such cases, total dose should aim for 65–70 Gy .\n• This may be appropriate for patients who are poor candidates for brachytherapy or where concern for toxicity is high, such as tumors that \nare extremely close to the rectum or anus.\nReirradiation\n• IORT (category 3): IORT is a specialized technique that delivers a single, highly focused dose of radiation to an at-risk tumor bed or \nisolated unresectable residual disease during an open surgical procedure.5 It is particularly useful in patients with recurrent disease within \na previously radiated volume. During IORT, overlying normal tissue (such as bowel or other viscera) can be manually displaced from the \nregion at risk. IORT is typically delivered with electrons, brachytherapy, or miniaturized x-ray sources using preformed applicators of \nvariable sizes matched to the surgically defined region at risk, which further constrains the area and depth of radiation exposure to avoid \nsurrounding normal structures.\n• Other techniques for reirradiation may include intracavitary or interstitial brachytherapy, SBRT, IMRT, or proton therapy. Such cases are \nhighly individualized and depend on the target, proximity to critical organs, previous RT dose, extent of overlap, and time intervals since \nprior RT. The appropriate dose for each case needs to be individualized.\nContinued\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

Consider cystoscopy and proctoscopy concurrently to exclude bladder/rectal invasion. \nPerform evaluation of cervix and vulva to exclude other gynecologic primary sites.\n• In patients who are premenopausal, ovarian preservation or transposition should be considered when feasible.\n• Fiducial markers may be placed to define the extent of the vaginal lesion.\n• Definitive surgical management for vaginal cancer is not often utilized, and the alternative of radiation should be considered.\n• For microscopic lesions at the top of the vagina, upper vaginectomy ± hysterectomy may be reasonable. A radical hysterectomy may be \nappropriate for macroscopic lesions (<2 cm). \n• For proximal lesions involving the upper two thirds of the vagina, the pelvic lymph nodes should be assessed.\n• For distal lesions involving the lower 1/3 of the vagina, the inguinal lymph nodes should be assessed.\n• Vaginal reconstruction should be considered for appropriate candidates desiring such procedures.\n• For primary, untreated lesions in which resection would require excision of the urethra, bladder, or rectum, radiation is often preferred. \n• Vaginectomy may be considered for small lesions for which margins are likely to be negative. Every effort should be made to obtain \nnegative margins.\n• Pelvic exenteration may be considered for recurrent or persistent disease localized to the pelvis or when primary RT is not feasible. \nVAG-EPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

These treatments cause \nacute, short-term, and long-term toxicities.  \n• Surgical approaches may be extensive and pose risks such as adhesion formation, which may cause pain and may contribute to small bowel \nobstruction, urinary or gastrointestinal complications (eg, incontinence, diarrhea), pelvic floor dysfunction (manifested by a variety of urinary , \nbowel, and/or sexual effects), and lymphedema.  \n• Chemotherapy agents vary, though commonly used regimens may pose a significant risk of neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, development of \nhematologic cancers, and cognitive dysfunction. \n• Long-term estrogen deprivation may cause symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and bone loss.  \n• RT may cause long-term complications (eg, fibrosis, vulvovaginal atrophy) and may predispose patients to secondary cancers of the \nsubcutaneous tissue, and/or underlying organs that are proximal to the radiation field.  \n• Prior pelvic RT may contribute to bone loss and increase the risk of pelvic fractures. Consider bone density testing and prophylactic use of \nbisphosphonates, particularly in patients with osteoporosis.\n• Immunotherapy use is emerging, and to date, long-term effects of these treatments are unknown. \nAdditional Guidance  \n• NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management\n• NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation\n• NCCN Guidelines for SurvivorshipPsychosocial Effects \n• Psychosocial effects after cancer may be psychological (eg, depression, anxiety , fear of recurrence, altered body image), financial (eg, return \nto work, insurance concerns), and/or interpersonal (eg, relationships, sexuality , intimacy) in nature.  \nClinical Approach\n• All gynecologic cancer survivors should receive regular general medical care that focuses on managing chronic disease, monitoring \ncardiovascular risk factors, providing recommended vaccinations, and encouraging adoption of a healthy lifestyle.\n• In order to assess the late and long-term effects of gynecologic cancers, clinicians should comprehensively document the patient’ s history, \nconduct a thorough physical examination, and provide any necessary imaging and/or laboratory testing. All patients, whether sexually \nactive or not, should be asked about genitourinary symptoms, including vulvovaginal dryness. Referral to appropriate specialty providers \n(eg, physical therapy, pelvic floor therapy, sexual therapy, psychotherapy) is recommended. As most treatments for gynecologic cancers \nwill cause sexual dysfunction, early menopause, and infertility, special attention to the resultant medical and psychosocial implications is \nneeded.  \n• Post-radiation use of vaginal dilators and moisturizers is recommended. Local vaginal estrogen may be considered if symptomatic.\n• For treatment-related menopause, hormone therapy should be considered.\n• Communication and coordination with all clinicians involved in the care of survivors, including primary care clinicians, is critical. Providing \ncancer survivors with a summary of their treatment and recommendations for follow-up is recommended.  \nVAG-FPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

NCCN Guidelines®, and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-2 Overview   \nVaginal cancer is a rare gynecologic malignancy representing 1% to 2% of \nall gynecologic neoplasms.1 An estimated 8070 new cases of vaginal and \nother genital cancers will be diagnosed in the United States in 2025 , and \n1950 people are estimated to  die of the disease .2 Because of the rarity of \nvaginal cancer, phase 3 trials have not been carried out and current \nguidelines have been drawn up on retrospective or comparative studies. \nVaginal cancer is  also the most common type of metachronous \nmalignancy  after cervical cancer diagnosis, followed by vulvar cancer and \nanal cancer .3 In individuals with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at the \ntime of hysterectomy, the risk of contracting vaginal cancer is more than double compared to non -hysterectomized individuals\n4. The risk for vaginal \ncancers is most common in individuals AFAB >70 years . Age -\nstandardized  incidence rate of  vaginal preinvasive neoplasia ranges \nbetween 0.5  to 1.3 per 100,000 individuals  AFAB (before human \npapillomavirus [ HPV] vaccination) and those aged 60 to 69 years are at  \ngreater  risk.5 The majority of invasive vaginal carcinomas are squamous \ncell carcinoma  (SCC) , and the second most common type is melanoma.6 \nSCC accounts for 80% to 90% of cases and most commonly arises in the upper portion of the posterior wall of the vagina.\n6 Some of the risk factors \nbased on e tiologic insights from case studies include vaginal damage from \nring pessaries, chronic vaginitis, sexual behavior, birthing trauma, obesity, \nexposure to chemicals in the vagina, and HPV.7 \nPersistent infection with high-risk HPV types has been detected i n 40% to \n70% of all vulvar and vaginal cancers, and in about 85 % to 90% of vaginal \nintraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and 3 (V aIN 2/3).5 The specific HPV \ntypes detected in cervical, vulvar , and vaginal cancer vary widely  due to \ndifferences in the sensitivity of the HPV detection methods used, HPV \ndistribution, and different HPV positivity age groups reported. HPV16 , the \nmost common type, is  detected in 48% to 72% of cervical, 27 % to 58% of vulvar , and 46 % to 77% of vaginal cancers. HPV18 has been detected in \n11% to 22% of cervical, 2 % to 10% of vulvar , and 3% to 27% of vaginal \ncancers. HPV16 has been reported to be present in 49% to 81% of Va IN \n2/3, whereas only 2 % to 14% of these lesions test positive for HPV18.5 \nSince patients with previous cervical carcinoma have a substantial risk of developing vaginal carcinoma, presumably because these sites share \nexposure and/or susceptibility to endogenous or exogenous carcinogenic \nstimuli, epidemiologic risk factors associated with cervical cancer are also \nshared risk factors for vaginal cancer including history of smoking, parity, \noral contraceptive use, early age of onset of coitus, larger number of \nsexual partners, history of sexually transmitted disease, certain \nautoimmu ne diseases, and chronic immunosuppression.\n8-10 Smoking \ncessation should be advised in patients who current ly smoke, and patients \nwho former ly smoke d should continue to avoid smoking (see the NCCN \nGuidelines for Smoking Cessation  and http://smokefree.gov ). \nIn 2020,  the World Health Organization ( WHO ) updated the Female \nGenital Tumors classification and recommends  distinguishing between \nHPV-associated and HPV -independent SCC of the vagina.11 The majority \nof vaginal SCCs are HPV -associated  with a non- keratinizing morphology \nand are in the proximal  or intermediate third (Müllerian)  portion of the \nvagina. Distal SCCs, also known as introitus carcinoma and that stem \nfrom the urogenital sinus , generally lack HPV association and are often \nkeratinizing SCCs.11 WHO recommends that for vaginal carcinomas, \nmolecular analyses (ie, HPV detection in situ) are not indicated for the diagnostic evaluation.  \nThe NCCN Vaginal  Cancer Guidelines subcommittee acknowledges that \nthe 2020  version of the WHO classification discussed the integration of the \nimmunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular profiles that has led to a better \nclassification system that is now adapted in the 2020 WHO Classification \nof Female Genital Tumors .\n11  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

NCCN Guidelines®, and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-3 Regardless of cancer subtype and HPV infection status, primary treatment \nwith curative intent for patients with vaginal cancer typically consists of \nradiation, surgery, chemoradiation, or a combination of these treatments; \noptions vary by cancer stage. By definition, the NCCN Clinical Practice \nGuidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) cannot incorporate all \npossible clinical variations and are not intended to replace good clinical \njudgment or individualization of treatments. “Many exceptions to the rule” \nwere discussed among the members of the Vaginal  Cancer Panel  during \nthe process of developing these Guidelines.  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at www.NCCN.org\n.  \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the development  of this version of the NCCN Guidelines® for \nVaginal  Cancer, an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain key literature in cervical cancer published since the \nprevious Guidelines update, using the following search terms: vaginal  \ncancer or vaginal  carcinoma. The PubMed database was chosen as it \nremains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature.   \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase 2; Clinical Trial, Phase 3; Clinical Trial, Phase 4 ; \nGuideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Multi -center \nstudies; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional \nsourc es deemed as relevant to these Guidelines as discussed by the \nPanel  during the Guidelines development  have been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high -level \nevidence is lacking are based on the Panel ’s review of lower -level \nevidence and expert opinion.   \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.  NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and \ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing \non organ -specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the inform ation is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-4 cancer is frequently found in combination with cervical cancer. With a rare \ncancer like vaginal cancer, it is important to consider synchronous \nanorectal, cervical, endometrial, or vulvar primary with vaginal metastasis \nor extension, or recurrent disease from prior malignancy. Only a minority \nof vaginal cancers originate in the vagina. The remaining are generally \nmetastatic from other sites. If vaginal lesion(s) involve the cervix or vulva, they are not considered vaginal cancer,  and the appropriate treatment \nalgorithm should be consulted. Biopsy remains the gold standard for \ndiagnosing vaginal cancer. This can be best accomplished by an \nexamination under anesthesia (EUA) and should include inspection of the \nvaginal fornices and biopsies of the cervix.  \nWorkup for these patients with suspicious symptoms includes history and \nphysical, pelvic exam (bimanual and rectovaginal), cervical evaluation and \npap cytology , colposcopy, vulvar evaluation, imaging, complete blood \ncount (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) , and testing for HPV \nand human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in select patients. Due to diverse \ndiagnosis of vaginal cancer, multidisciplinary expertise is recommended.  \nFor detailed surgical staging and imaging recommendations by stage and \nplanned treatment approach, see Principles of Surgery , Principles of \nImaging,  and Staging in the algorithm . Smoking cessation and counseling, \nas well as HIV testing (especially in younger patients), are recommended.  \nPrinciples of Staging and Surgery  \nClinical Staging  \nVaginal cancer is primarily staged clinically like cervical cancer. The \nstaging is based on the results of a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging \ntests performed before treatment selection using 2009 International \nFederation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)  staging. The FIGO \nGynecologic Oncology Committee also recommends that imaging should be used to better define tumor volume and extension of disease wherever available.  \nThe staging definition according to FIGO 2009 staging is as follows : stage \nIA, the cancer is only in the vagina and is ≤2.0 cm; stage IB, the tumor is \nconfined to the vagina, measuring >2.0 cm; stage IIA, the cancer has \ngrown through the vaginal wall, but not as far as the pelvic wall and is ≤2.0 \ncm (4/5 inch); stage IIB, the cancer has grown through the vaginal wall, \nbut not as far as the pelvic wall and is > 2.0 cm (4/5 inch); s tage III , the \ntumor extends to the pelvic sidewall (defined as the muscle, fasc ia, \nneurovascular structures, or skeletal portions of the bony pelvis) and/or is \ncausing hydronephrosis or nonfunctioning kidney; stage IVA, the tumor is \ninvading the mucosa of the bladder or rectum and/or is extending beyond \nthe true pelvis (bullous edema is not sufficient evidence to classify a tumor \nas T4) ; and stage IVB, d istant metastasis.  \nPrinciples of Pathology \nPathologic Assessment  \nThe College of American Pathologists (CAP) protocol for primary \ncarcinoma of the vagina is a useful guide for the examination of resection \nspecimens : https://documents.cap.org/protocols/cp- femalereproductive-\nvagina- resection- 20-4201.pdf . \nThis CAP protocol was revised in February 2020 and reflects recent  \nupdates  to AJCC staging (ie, AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition)  \nand FIGO C ancer Report 2018.12 All staging guidelines in the algorithm \nare based on 2009  FIGO staging and AJCC staging, unless otherwise \nnoted. Surgico- pathologic factors may be used to guide the extent of \nsurgical staging and treatment decisions. Findings from pathologic assessment of the surgical specimen should be carefully documented  \naccording to CAP protocol for vaginal carcinoma.

The predominant pathway for vaginal SIL and vaginal \nSCC is HPV infection -predominant high -risk HPV types with the most \ncommon type being HPV16.  In 2012, based on the recommendation of \nthe Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) Project , a uniform \ntwo-tiered terminology for HPV -associated SIL across all anogenital tract \norgans  that distinguishes between low -grade SIL (LSIL) and high- grade \nSIL (HSIL)  was introduced.13 SIL is now the preferred terminology, which \ncan be synonymous ly used with the three- tiered system of intraepithelial \nneoplasia. LSIL encompasses both low - and high- risk HPV infection and \nVaIN 1, while HSIL includes VaIN 2 and VaIN 3 and is exclusively \nassociated with high- risk HPV types.14 The risk of progression from HSIL \nor VaIN to invasive SCC  is approximately  5%. Categorization of vaginal \nSCC has been simplified into HPV -associated and HPV -independent \ntypes based upon pathogenesis. If association is unknown,  inclusion of \n“not otherwise specified (NOS)” is recommended. Previously used terms, “warty,” “basaloid,” “verrucous,” and “papillary,” are  no longer necessary \ncomponents of the histologic type.  HPV-independent SCCs  of the vagina \nare much less common and are often seen in postmenopaus al \nindividuals AFAB (median age 73 years). These tumors are \npredominantly of the keratinizing type of histology and demonstrate negative p16 and positive p53  IHC. As with HPV -associated vaginal \ncarcinomas, prior history (<5 years) of cervical and vulvar carcinomas \nmust be  excluded.   \nOther types of vaginal carcinomas are very rare and include  HPV-\nassociated vaginal adenocarcinoma, endometrioid carcinoma, clear cell \ncarcinoma, mucinous carcinoma (gastric and intestinal types), \nmesonephric adenocarcinoma, carcinosarcoma, mixed tumor of  the \nvagina, adenocarcinoma of skene gland origin, adenosquamous carcinoma, adenoid basal carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinomas,  \nadenosarcoma, and germ cell tumors . \nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) and comprehensive molecular \nprofiling as determined by a U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)-\napproved assay, or validated  test performed in a Clinical Laboratory \nImprovement Amendments (CLIA) -certified laboratory  is recommended \nfor the following biomarkers:  programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1), \nmicrosatellite instability -high (MSI -H), tumor mutational burden (TMB) , \nNTRK  fusion, RET fusion, HER2 IHC or fluorescence in situ hybridization \n(FISH ), and p53 IHC . \nPrognostic and Predictive Biomarkers   \nThe data cited within this section are primarily for cervical cancer  and \nhave  been generalized to vaginal cancer . Because of the uncommon \nnature of vaginal cancer  and its similarities to cervical cancer, many of \nthe treatment recommendations  are derived from those for cervical \ncancer . Several biomarker -based immune -oncologic agents have been \nadded from the NCCN Guidelines for Cervical Cancer to the NCCN \nGuidelines for Vaginal Cancer  in the management of vaginal cancer ( see \nSystemic Therapy Recommendations ) and the NCCN Panel \nrecommends comprehensive molecular profiling as determined by a n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

Out of 98 patients treated, 82 \n(83.7%) had PD -L1–positive tumors (CPS ≥1), with 77 having previously \nreceived one or more lines of chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic \ndisease. The primary endpoint, overall response rate ( ORR) , was 12.2% \n(95% CI, 6.5% –20.4%), with 3 complete and 9 partial responses  (PRs) . \nAll 12 responses were in patients with PD -L1–positive tumors, for an \nORR of 14.6% (95% CI, 7.8% –24.2%); 14.3% (95% CI, 7.4% –24.1%) of \nthese responses were in those who had received one or more lines of \nchemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease. Based on these \nresults, the FDA granted accelerated approval of pembrolizumab for \npatients with advanced PD -L1–positive cervical cancer who experienced \nprogression during or after chemotherapy. NCCN also recommends pembrolizumab as a preferred regimen for patients who are PD-L1–\npositive for second- line or subsequent therapy  for vaginal cancer, based \non the recommendations for cervi cal cancer.  \nNivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, has shown efficacy in patients with \nrecurrent/metastatic cervical cancer who received at least one prior \nchemotherapy regimen. The Checkmate -358, phase 1–2, single -arm trial \nevaluated 19 patients with advanced, pretreated, HPV-associated \ncervical  tumors.17 The ORR was 26.3% ( 95% CI, 9.1 %–51.2% ) and \ndisease control rate was 68.4% (95%  CI, 43.4 %–87.4% ). The 12 -month \noverall survival ( OS) rate was 77.5% (95%  CI, 50.5% –91.0%) . The \nphase 2 trial (NRG -GY002) showed low anti -tumor activity of nivolumab \nin 25 patients with pretreated persistent/recurrent cervical cancer; 36% of \nthe patients had stable disease ( 90% CI, 20.2%−54.4% ) as best \nresponse with median duration of 5.7 months, and progression -free \nsurvival ( PFS) and OS at 6 months were 16% and 78.4%, \nrespectively.18,19  \nBased on the NCCN Guidelines  for Cervical Cancer , the Panel  continues \nto recommend nivolumab in the same category  of “useful in certain \ncircumstances” for second- line or subsequent therapy for vaginal cancer . \nFollowing FDA approval20 of nivolumab and hyaluronidase for \nsubcutaneous injection across approved adult solid tumor as \nmonotherapy, and monotherapy maintenance following completion of \nnivolumab, the NCCN Panel added that nivolumab and hyaluronidase -\nnvhy  subcutaneous injection may be substituted for  IV nivolumab. \nNivolumab and hyaluronidase- nvhy  has different dosing and \nadministration instructions compared to IV nivolumab.   \nMismatch Repair /Microsatellite Instability   \nTumors with mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) represent \napproximately 2% to 4% of all diagnosed cancers and have a unique \ngenetic signature, harboring 10 to 100 times more mutations than PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

These dMMR tumors have MSI -H \nand harbor 100 to 1000  somatic mutations that encode potential \nneoantigens  and are likely  to be immunogenic . The KEYNOTE -158 trial \nincluded patients with non-colorectal  MSI-H/dMMR tumors in cohort K  \nand the results demonstrated  the clinical benefit of pembrolizumab in \npatients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic MSI -H/dMMR \nnon-colorectal cancer.21 \nOf 233 patients  with MSI -H/dMMR advanced non -colorectal cancer  \nwhose disease progressed on prior therapy received pembrolizumab , the \nORR was 34.3% (95% CI, 28.3% –40.8%). Median PFS was 4.1 months  \n(95% CI, 2.4 –4.9 months) and median OS  was 23.5 months (95% CI, \n13.5 months – not reached [NR]). Extending the NCCN Panel \nrecommend ation for cervical cancer s, pembrolizumab is also \nrecommended as a preferred regimen for MSI -H/dMMR tumors as a \nsecond -line or subsequent therapy for recurrent or metastatic vaginal \ncanc er. \nTMB \nTMB, defined as the total number of somatic mutations per coding area \nof a tumor  genome, is a measure of all non- synonymous coding \nmutations in a tumor  exome ; highly mutated tumors  can produce many \nneoantigens, some of which might increase T -cell reactivity. High TMB \nhas been demonstrated to be associated with treatment response to \npembrolizumab.  \nIn a prospective analysis of the multi -cohort, open- label, non -randomized \nphase 2 KEYNOTE- 158 study ,22 the association between antitumor  \nactivity and tissue  TMB  (tTMB ) in patients who received at least one \ndose of pembrolizumab was assessed and tTMB -high (tTMB -H) status \nidentified a subgroup of patients who could have a robust tumor  \nresponse to pembrolizumab monotherapy. Out of 790 TMB -evaluable, \ntreated patients  enrolled by at least 26 weeks before data cutoff , 102  (13%) patients  were tTMB -H (<10 mutations per megabase  [mut/Mb] ) \nand 688 (87%) patients had non– tTMB -H status. With a m edian study \nfollow- up of 37.1 months , the o bjective responses were observed in 30 \n(29%; 95% CI , 21–39) of 102 patients in the tTMB -H group and 43 (6%;  \n95% CI;  5–8) of 688  patients  in the non– tTMB -H group. Cervical cancer \nhad the highest proportion of patients with tTMB -H status (21%) and \nobjective responses were observed in 5 of 16 patients with tTMB -H \nstatus and 7 of 59 patients with non–tTMB -H status within the cervical \ncohort.  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends TMB testing by an FDA -approved assay, \nor a validated test performed in a CLIA -certified laboratory and  \nrecommends pembrolizumab as a preferred regimen for the treatment of \npatients with TMB -high ( TMB -H) (≥10 mut/Mb ) tumors  that have \nprogressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory  \nalternative treatment options  (second -line or subsequent therapy).  \nNTRK Gene F usion  \nNTRK gene fusions are found in about 1% of all solid tumors .

The three \nclinical trials included a phase 1 dose -finding study in adults, a phase 1–\n2 dose -finding study in a pediatric population, and a phase 2, single -arm, \nbasket trial .25 The ORR of larotrectinib in these patients was 75% (95% \nCI, 61% –85%) , with 13% CR and 62% PR with median DoR and PFS not \nreached at the time. In a long -term follow -up analysis, out of 153 \npatients, 121 patients (79%; 95% CI, 72 –85) had objective response with \n16% having a CR, 63% having a PR, and 12% having stable disease. \nThe median DoR was 35.2 months (22.8– NE) and the median PFS was \n28.3 months.26 Both larotrectinib and entrectinib are FDA -approved for \nNTRK  gene fusion solid tumors for patients who have progressed \nfollowing treatment or have no satisfactory standard therapy .27,28 \nResults from a recent pivotal phase 1/2 TRIDENT -1 trial presented at \nESMO  Congress , 202329 showed robust responses and durable clinical \nactivity of repotrectinib, a next -generation ROS1 and TRK tyrosine \nkinase inhibitor  (TKI) in both TKI -naïve and -pretreated patients  with \nNTRK  fusion -positive ( NTRK +) solid tumors, including non-small cell lung \ncancer ( NSCLC ). In a multicenter, single -arm, open -label, multi -cohort \ntrial, efficacy was evaluated in 48 patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic NTRK  gene fusion- positive solid tumors who had r eceived a \nprior TRK TKI and 40 patients who were TKI na ïve. Confirmed ORR in \nthe TKI -naïve group was 58% (95% CI: 41 -73) and 50% (95% CI: 35- 65) \nin the TKI -pretreated group. Median D oR was NE (95% CI: NE -NE) in \nthe TKI -naïve group and 9.9 months (95% CI: 7.4 -13.0) in the TKI -\npretreated group.  Based on these trial data, the FDA granted accelerated approval to repotrectinib for  patients with  locally advanced or metastatic \nsolid tumors that have a n NTRK  gene fusion, and that have progressed \nfollowing treatment or have no satisfactory alternative therapy.30 The \nNCCN Panel added the repotrectinib regimen for NTRK  gene fusion -\npositive tumors under useful in certain circumstances for second -line or \nsubsequent therapy . \nHER2  \nHER2 expression is observed in a wide range of solid tumors and is an \nestablished prognostic biomarker for breast, gastric, and colorectal \ncancers. Cervical cancer has shown a HER2 positivity rate of \napproximately 2% to 6% in the literature.31-33 Trastuzumab deruxtecan is \nan antibody -drug conjugate that contains the humanized anti -HER2 \nmonoclonal antibody trastuzumab attached to the topoisomerase inhibitor deruxtecan.\n34 Another tumor -agnostic study evaluated the durability and \nclinically meaningful response of trastuzumab deruxtecan across multiple \nHER2 -expressing (IHC 3+ or 2+) advanced solid tumor types in patients \nwho progressed on prior therapy or who have no satisfactory alternative \ntreatment options.  \nThe DESTINY -PanTumor02 is  an open- label, multicenter, phase 2 trial \nthat evaluated t rastuzumab deruxtecan  in 267 patients with \nHER2 -expressing (IHC 3+  or 2+) locally advanced or metastatic disease \nafter ≥1 systemic treatment or without alternative treatments. The study \nincluded 40 patients with cervical cancer with IHC2+ or 3+ expression of \nHER2. Overall, the ORR was 37.1% (n = 99; [95% CI, 31.3 –43.2]) , the \nmedian PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.6– 8.0), and the median OS was \n13.4 months (95% CI, 11.9– 15.5). In patients with cervical cancer, the \nconfirmed ORR was 50% and for the HER2 IHC3+ cohort, the ORR was \n75% and  the median OS was 13.6 months .35 The Panel  recommends \nHER2 IHC testing (with  or without  reflex to HER2 FISH for equivocal IHC) \nfor advanced, metastatic,  or recurrent vaginal  cancer .

The prognosis of \ndisease in this small subset of patients who have progressed on or \nfollowing prior systemic therapy is poor. The phase 1–2, multicenter, \nopen- label trial , Libretto- 001, evaluated the efficacy of selpercatinib in \npatients  with RET-mutant advanced solid tumors. In an interim analysis of \nthe trial in a tumor -agnostic population, the efficacy and safety of \nselpercatinib was invest igated in 41 patients with RET fusion- positive solid \ntumors (other than NSCLC and thyroid cancer) with disease progression \non or after previous systemic therapies or who had no satisfactory \ntherapeutic options. The ORR was 44% (95% CI, 28.5– 60.3), with a \nmedian DoR of 24.5 months (95% CI, 9.2– NE).36,37 Selpercatinib received \ntumor -agnostic approval by the FDA for patients with solid tumors with a \nRET gene fusion that has progressed on or following prior systemic \ntreatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. \nComprehensive molecular profiling can be considered by an FDA -\napproved assay, or a validated test performed in a CLIA -certified \nlaboratory including at least microsatellite instability (MSI), TMB testing, NTRK , and RET for predicting rare pan -tumor targeted therapy .

The p16 and Ki -67 expression might be useful in tumor grading, \nand p16 expression can be used as a marker for HPV positivity.38 The \np16 marker has a significant prognostic value in vaginal cancers across \nall tumor stages.  In a retrospective chart review from 1997 to 2006 ,39 43 \npatients with vaginal cancer were evaluated by  IHC staining for the \npresence of p16 and Ki -67 markers, and survival data were examined.  \nPatients with v aginal cancer (n = 31) with a p16 positive diffuse staining \nhad significantly improved survival (~49.5 months; P = .003) compared \nwith patients with p16-negative disease (~25.3 months). Stage- specific \nanalysis showed a significant survival benefit for p16- positive vaginal \ncancers compared with p16- negative cancers for stages I and II ( P = \n.017; hazard ratio [ HR], 0.400; 95% CI, 0.189– 0.850) and stages III and \nIV (P = .001; HR, 0.176; 95% CI, 0.066– 0.479).39 There are several \nsystematic reviews emphasizing the positive prognostic value of HPV \nand p16 positivity in vaginal cancer.40,41 The NCCN Panel recommends \nancillary testing to determine HPV status either by p16 IHC or RNA in \nsitu hybridization (ISH) or  by DNA sequencing .  \np53 IHC   \np53 mutations are common in HPV -negative malignancies in older \nwomen, and they are linked to an increased risk of mortality.7 In vulvar \ncancer, p16 and p53 IHC have established prognostic value, stratifying \npatients into three groups  based on the HPV and TP53  mutation status \nof the tumor.  p53 positivity is associated  with poor prognosis and \nsignificantly increased recurrence and disease -specific mortality  in \ngynecologic cancers.42 The TP53  mutations are present in typical \nkeratinizing carcinomas  and precursor lesions with elevated risk for \ngynecologic cancer s. TP53 mutation seems to occur early in vulvar \ncarcinogenesis and is a useful marker, especially in lesions with \nincreased risk of carcinoma .43 While HPV types 16 and 18 might play a \ncommon causal role in cervical carcinoma, p53 gene mutations might be PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

For >2 cm lesions confined \nto the vagina, external beam RT (EBRT) with intracavitary brachytherapy \nor interstitial brachytherapy if >0.5 cm residual thickness at brachytherapy \nwith/without concurrent platinum -containing chemotherapy is \nrecommended.  \nAnother option for patients with invasive stage I disease is surgical \nresection with or without lymph node assessment only for select  patients.  \nSurgery is only recommended if a complete resection with clear margins is feasible without excessive morbidity and with the likelihood that no \nadjuvant RT would be required. Pelvic lymph nodes need to be assessed \nfor proximal lesions involving the upper two thirds of the vagina, while \ninguinal lymph nodes should be assessed for distal lesions involving the \nlower one-third of the vagina.  Surgery is only recommended if a complete \nresection with clear margins is feasible without excessive morbidity and with likelihood that no adjuvant RT would be required. Vaginectomy may \nbe considered for small lesions for which margins are likely to be negative. For microscopic lesions at the top of the vagina, upper vaginectomy ± hysterectomy may be reasonable. A radical hysterectomy may be \nappropriate for macroscopic lesions (<2 cm).  Every effort should be made \nto obtain negative mar gins. With postoperative risk factor  of close or \npositive margin(s) for invasive disease or positive lymph nodes, adjuvant \nRT or chemoradiation and/or brachytherapy is recommended. The \nmanagement of positive margins for HSIL should be individualized.  \nFor invasive stage II –IVA disease, the preferred modality for definitive \nmanagement is platinum -based chemoradiation with brachytherapy. \nConcurrent chemotherapy has been shown in many series to improve outcomes and is often used in stage II –IV disease. Concurrent platinum -\ncontaining chemotherapy with EBRT utilizes cisplatin as a single agent (or carboplatin if cisplatin intolerant). EBRT with brachytherapy is also a \nrecommended regimen for patients with stage II –IVA disease. The \naddition of brachytherapy to  EBRt  is preferred as the combination has \nbeen shown to improve disease control.   \nFor more information on the important phase 3 clinical trials underpinning \ntreatment recommendations for cervical cancer  that were adapted for \nvaginal cancer, see  the NCCN Clinical Guidelines for Cervical Cancer\n. \nSurveillance  \nThe Panel  agrees with the new Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) \nrecommendations for post -treatment surveillance.45 The recommended \nsurveillance is based on the patient’s risk for recurrence and personal preferences. History and physical examinations  are recommended every 3 \nto 6 months for 2 years, every 6 to 12 months for another 3 to 5 years, and then annually.  \nMany of the recommendations for staging and follow -up of primary vaginal \ncancer are derived from cervical cancer and they have generalizability to \nvaginal cancer due to similar tumor biology.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-11 recommendations for cervical cancer can be extrapolated to vaginal \ncancer and the principles of post -chemoradiation tumor response \nevaluation are  largely analogous.46 Early post -treatment imaging is \ngenerally performed following a period of approximately 3 to 4 months \nafter the completion of chemoradiation to assess response.46 Further \nimaging is needed as indicated based on symptoms or examination \nfindings suspicious for recurrence. However, recurrence  should be proven \nby biopsy before proceeding with  treatment planning.  \nAnnual cervical/vaginal cytology tests can be considered as indicated for detection of lower genital tract dysplasia ( eg, for those who have had \nfertility -sparing surgery) , which includes HPV testing. Some clinicians have \nsuggested that rigorous cytology follow -up is not warranted because of \nstudies stating that Pap cytology  did not detect recurrences in patients \nwith stage I or II cervical cancer who were asymptomatic after \ntreatment.\n45,47,48 Noting the inherent differences between these patients \nand the general screening population, the Panel  does not recommend \nworkup of low -grade squamous dysplasia detected during surveillance, but \nsuggests that patients should follow up with a provider with specific \nexpertise in this area. It is important to emphasize good clinical evaluation \nand a high index of suspicion, because the detection rate of recurrent \ngenital tract  cancer is low using cervical and vaginal cytology alone.49 \nMany other tests remain optional based on clinical indications, such as semiannual CBCs, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine \ndeterminations. Patients with persistent or recurrent disease need to be \nevaluated using additional imaging studies as clinically indicated , biopsy \nwith or without EUA , and surgical exploration in selected cases followed \nby therapy for relapse (see Therapy for R elapse).\n50 Comprehensive \nmolecular profiling as determined by FDA- approved assay or a validated \ntest performed in a CLIA -certified laboratory can be considered for better \nselection of systemic therapy. If tissue biopsy of a metastatic site is not feasible or tissue is not available, comprehensive genomic profiling via a validated plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay can be considered.  \nEducation of patients  regarding symptoms suggestive of recurrence is \nrecommended (eg, vaginal discharge; weight loss; anorexia; pain in the \npelvis, hips, back, or legs; persistent coughing). Patients should also be \ncounseled on healthy lifestyle, obesity, nutrition, exercise, sexual health  \n(including vaginal dilator use and lubricants/moisturizers), hormone replacement therapy  (local estrogen and hormone therapy for \nmenopause) , and potential long- term and late effects of treatment. \nSmoking cessation and abstinence should be encouraged.\n45 See the \nNCCN Guidelines for Survivorship , the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking \nCessation , and https://www.cancer.org/cancer/survivorship .  \nCervical cancer survivors are at risk for second cancers  such as vaginal \ncancer .51 Data suggest that patients who undergo RT for pelvic cancers \nare at risk for radiation- induced second cancers, especially at radiated \nsites near the cervix (eg, colon, rectum/anus, urinary bladder); therefore, careful surveillance is appropriate for these patients.\n52,53  \nTherapy for Relapse  \nRecurrences should be proven by biopsy before proceeding to treatment planning for recurrent disease. \nLocoregional Recurrence   \nFor patients who experience locoregional recurrences who have not \nundergone previous RT or who experience recurrences outside of the \npreviously treated RT field, therapy for relapse includes tumor -directed \nEBRT and/or brachytherapy or EBRT with concurrent platinum -containing \nchemotherapy and/or brachytherapy. Typically, the chemoradiation for \nrecurrence uses cisplatin  as a single agent  or carboplatin (if cisplatin \nintolerant) .\n54,55 However, in those patients who have relapsed soon after PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-12 completing initial chemoradiation with these regimens, other systemic \ntherapy options might be considered or best supportive care could be \noffered (see NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care ).  \nFor patients with locoregional recurrences with prior intracavitary brachytherapy only, i ndividualized EBRT with/without systemic therapy \nand/or interstitial brachytherapy  is recommended. Concurrent surgery is \nonly recommended if a complete resection with clear margins is feasible \nwithout excessive morbidity.  \nPatients with central pelvic recurrent disease after prior EB RT and/or \nbrachytherapy  should be evaluated for pelvic exenteration with (or without) \nintraoperative RT (IORT), although IORT is category 3  for both cervical \nand vaginal cancers .\n56-63 Surgical mortality is generally ≤ 5%, with survival \nrates approaching 50% in carefully selected patients.59 Concomitant \nmeasures with these radical procedures include adequate rehabilitation programs dealing with the psychosocial and psychosexual consequences \nof the surgery as well as reconstructive procedures.\n58,64 -66 In carefully \nselected patients, reirradiation or local excision is also recommended. See Principles of Radiation Therapy  for more information.  \nFor patients with noncentral recurrent disease, options include systemic \ntherapy or resection with (or without) IORT (category 3 for IORT) , \nreirradiation or best supportive care  (see \nNCCN Guidelines for Palliative \nCare ), or participation in a clinical trial.  \nPatients who experience recurrence after second -line definitive therapy, \neither surgery or RT, have a poor prognosis. They can be treated with systemic therapy or best supportive care or  can be enrolled in a clinical \ntrial.  Stage IVB or Recurrent Distant Metastatic Disease  \nLimited Disease \nFor stage IVB patients or patients with recurrent metastases with limited \ndisease, systemic therapy is one of the options . Comprehensive \nmolecular profiling as determined by FDA -approved assay, or a validated \ntest performed in a CLIA -certified laboratory can be considered for better \nselection of systemic therapy. Local treatment of the primary disease by \nchemoradiation with/without brachytherapy can be considered. Local \ntreatment of metastases can also be considered that includes surgery for \nselect patients  or individualized EBRT or other local ablative therapies \nsuch as radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, or stereotactic body RT  \n(SBRT) .   \nDisseminated Disease  \nPatients who develop distant metastases, either at initial presentation or at \nrelapse, are rarely curable. Comprehensive molecular profiling as \ndetermined by FDA -approved assay  can be considered for better selection \nof systemic therapy.  For patients with disseminated disease, systemic \ntherapy with/without palliative RT and best supportive care are \nrecommended . Patients who may benefit from aggressive local therapy for \noligometastatic disease include those with nodal, lung, liver, or bone \nmetastases.67,68  \nThe palliation of pelvic recurrences in heavily irradiated sites that are not \namenable to local pain control techniques or to surgical resection is \ndifficult .69 These sites are generally not responsive to chemotherapy. \nAdequately palliating the complications of pain and fistulae from these recurrences is clinically challenging \n(https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/270646-overview\n). However, \nshort courses of RT may provide symptomatic relief to patients with bone metastases, painful para -aortic nodes, or supraclavicular adenopathy.\n70-72 \nFor most other patients with distant metastases , an appropriate approach PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

NCCN Guidelines®, and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-13 is a clinical trial, chemotherapy, or best supportive care (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Palliative Care ). \nSystemic Therapy Recommendations  \nThe data cited within this section are primarily for cervical cancer  and \nhave  been generalized to vaginal cancer . Because of the uncommon \nnature of vaginal cancer and its similarities to cervical cancer, many of \nthe treatment options are derived from those for cervical cancer . The \nsystemic therapy recommendations for primary vaginal cancer are \nextrapolated from cervical cancer since they share similar disease etiologies . There are no category 1 treatment recommendations for \nvaginal cancer due to lack of dis ease site -specific phase 3 trial data. The \nmajority of cases in the vagina might be arising from another site and the treatment recommendations will be based on corresponding NCCN \ntreatment Guidelines.  \nChemoradiation for Locally Advanced Vaginal  Cancer\n  \nConcurrent chemoradiation, using platinum -containing chemotherapy \n(cisplatin alone [preferred]), is the treatment of choice for stages IB3, II, III, \nand IVA disease based on results from randomized clinical trials.  These \ntrials have shown that the use of concurrent chemoradiation results in a 30% to 50% decrease in the risk of death compared with RT alone.  Long -\nterm follow -up of three  trials has confirmed that concurrent cisplatin -\ncontaining chemoradiation improves PFS and OS when compared with RT \nwith (or without) hydroxyurea.\n73-75 Cisplatin remains the preferred \nradiosensitizing agent in the primary treatment for patients with locally \nadvanced cervical cancer when used concomitantly with EBRT and \ncarboplatin is a preferred radiosensitizing agent for patients who are \ncisplatin intolerant .76 When  cisplatin and carboplatin are unavailable, the \nother recommended options are capecitabine/mitomycin IV, gemcitabine, \nand paclitaxel as radiosensitizers based on a few early -phase studies that \nhave shown their efficacy and tolerability when administered concomitantly with radiation.77-79 A phase 3, randomized trial enrolling 926 patients with \nlocally advanced, stage IIB –IVA cervical cancer evaluated the efficacy of \nRT plus concurrent chemotherapy consisting of oral 5- fluorouracil  (5-\nFU)/mitomycin as compared to RT only, RT plus adjuvant chemotherapy \n(5-FU), or RT plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant \nchemotherapy .77 Although acute side effects were more prevalent in the \nconcurrent arms and the OS was not significant between the arms, the RT plus concurrent chemotherapy arm showed the least locoregional \nrecurrence and the highest 5 -year disease- free survival ( DFS) when \ncompared with the other arms. In particular, the difference in DFS and OS rate was highly significant when comparing the concurrent chemoradiation \narm with the RT -only arm ( P = .0001). Several studies have shown that \nalthough 5- FU/mitomycin combined with  RT was effective, the \ncombination is also associated with relatively higher toxicity rates and \nshould be used with caution.\n80,81 The efficacy and safety of gemcitabine \ncombined with pelvic radiation was tested in 19 patients with chemo- naïve, \nadvanced- stage IIIB cervical cancer and showed a CR of 89.5% and PR of \n5.3% for an ORR of 94.7%. The OS at median follow -up time of 19.9 \nmonths was 100% with DFS of 84.2%. Due to gemcitabine’s high potency \nas a radiosensitizer, it requires reduced dosing when used concurrently \nwith radiation to avoid radiation toxicity .78 In a comparative study, the \ndisease control and toxicity profile were found to be similar between cisplatin and gemcitabine.\n82 The benefit of paclitaxel alone as a \nradiosensitizer has not been extensively studied in the literature and there are only a few known preclinical or early -phase studies of its efficacy. In a \npilot study to evaluate paclitaxel with RT, CR was achieved by 8 out of 13 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer and by 4 out of 6 patients \ntreated with a recurrent disease.\n83 Although chemoradiation is tolerated, \nacute and long- term side effects have been reported.84-86 Due to significant \ntoxicity concerns associated with these agents, cisplatin or carboplatin is a  \npreferred agent over other non -platinum chemoradiation regimens .

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-14 The NCCN Panel  has noted for all chemoradiation agents that the cost \nand toxicity profiles of these radiosensitizing agents should be considered \nwhen selecting an appropriate regimen for treatment and have strongly \nexpressed that this is especially critical when these r egimens are being \nused for extended -field RT where toxicities may be more severe .   \nSystemic Therapy for Recurrent or Metastatic Vaginal  Cancer   \nSystemic therapy with or without radiation forms the basis of treatment of \npatients with recurrent or metastatic disease.  \nFirst -Line Systemic Therapy Options  \nPreferred Regimens  \nPembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy With or Without Bevacizumab as \nFirst-Line Therapy  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Cervical Cancer include two \nimmunotherapy -based regimens as preferred, first -line therapy options for \nthe treatment of PD -L1–positive recurrent or metastatic cancer , and that \nrecommendation is extrapolated to vaginal cancer management as well . \nPembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy with or without \nbevacizumab regimens is a preferred  treatment option based on the \nresults of the KEYNOTE- 826 study.15 In the primary analysis of the phase \n3, KEYNOTE- 826 trial, which enrolled 617 patients (548 with PD -L1–\npositive CPS ≥1 tumors; 317 patients with CPS ≥10) with previously \nuntreated persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer, the addition \nof pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab improved \nPFS and OS versus the placebo group ( PFS, 10.4 vs. 8.2 months, \nrespectively; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53– 0.79; P < .001, and OS at 24 \nmonths: 50.4% vs. 40.4% , respectively; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54– 0.84; P < \n.001). The ORR was significantly higher in the pembrolizumab arm as \ncompared to the placebo group in patients with PD -L1–positive (CPS ≥1) \ntumors (68.1% vs. 50.2%). The FDA approved pembrolizumab plus \nchemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab for patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer whose tumors express PD -L1 \n(CPS ≥1). In the final updated analysis of the trial  results , the addition of \npembrolizumab to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab continued \nto show significant survival benefits in the PD -L1–positive (CPS ≥1) \ntumors at a median follow -up of 39. 1 months with  a median OS and PFS \nof 28.6 and 10.5 months versus 16.5 and 8.2 months in the \npembrolizumab plus chemotherapy arm versus the placebo plus \nchemotherapy arm, respectively (HR , 0.60; 95% CI, 0.49– 0.74; P < \n.0001) .87  \nPlatinum -based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin)/paclitaxel  with \nbevacizumab has been extensively investigated in clinical studies and is \nlisted in the NCCN Guidelines as a  preferred, first -line treatment option for \npatients with recurrent/metastatic vaginal cancer  (based on the GOG 240 \ntrial).  \nA randomized phase 3  trial (GOG 240) studied the addition of \nbevacizumab to combination chemotherapy regimens \n(cisplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab or topotecan/paclitaxel/bevacizumab) in \n452 patients in the first -line setting of metastatic, persistent, or recurrent \ncervical cancer. Analysis of pooled data from the two chemotherapy \nregimens revealed significant improvements in OS  among patients \nreceiving bevacizumab (16.8 vs. 13.3 months; P = .007).88 While \nbevacizumab led to higher toxicity ( eg, hypertension, thromboembolic \nevents, gastrointestinal [GI] fistula), it was not associated with a \nstatistically significant decrease in patient -reported quality of life ( P = \n.27).89 A 2017 systemic review and meta- analysis of data from 19 trials of \nsystemic therapy for patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic \ncervical cancer found a trend towards improved OS for the addition of \nbevacizumab to cisplatin/paclitaxel or topotecan/paclitaxel when compared \nwith all other non- bevacizumab– containing chemotherapy regimens.90   PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-15 The published data from a phase 3  randomized trial (JCOG0505) \nsuggested that carboplatin/paclitaxel was non -inferior to cisplatin/paclitaxel \nin 253 patients  with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer.91 Many \nphysicians use carboplatin/paclitaxel because of ease of administration \nand tolerability.92 Results from JCOG0505 showed that the \npaclitaxel /carboplatin regimen was non -inferior to paclitaxel /cisplatin  in \nterms of median OS  (18.3 months for paclitaxel /cisplatin  vs. 17.5 months \nfor paclitaxel /carboplatin; HR , 0.994 [90% CI, 0.79 –1.25] ; P = .032) and \nnon-hospitalization periods were significantly longer for patients receiving \npaclitaxel /carboplatin.91 However, among patients who had not received \nprior cisplatin, OS for carboplatin/paclitaxel  and cisplatin/pacltaxel  was \n13.0 and 23.2 months, respectively (HR , 1.571; 95% CI, 1.06– 2.32).91 \nBased on these data, the Panel  recommends carboplatin/paclitaxel as a \npreferred option for patients who have received prior cisplatin therapy .  \nA systematic review of the data on cisplatin/paclitaxel and \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel regimens also suggested that lower toxicity carboplatin- based regimens appear to be an equally effective alternative \nto cisplatin -containing regimens for treating recurrent or metastatic cervical \ncancer.\n93 Based on the collective findings from GOG 240 and JGOG0505, \nthe Panel  has included  carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab as an \nadditional preferred regimen for recurrent or metastatic vaginal  cancer . \nOther Recommended Regimens  \nCisplatin is generally regarded as the most active agent and is \nrecommended as a  first-line single -agent chemotherapy option for \nrecurrent or metastatic vaginal  cancer; reported response rates for cervical \ncancer are approximately 20% to 30%, with an occasional CR.94-97 OS with \ncisplatin is approximately 6 to 9 months. Both carboplatin and paclitaxel \nhave each been reported to be tolerable and efficacious and are also \npossible first -line single -agent chemotherapy options .98-102 Therefore, \npalliation with single agents —cisplatin, carboplatin, or paclitaxel —is a reasonable approach in patients with recurrent disease not amenable to surgical or radiotherapeutic approaches. However, most patients who \ndevelop metastatic disease have received concurrent cisplatin/RT as \nprimary treatment and may no longer be sensitive to single -agent platinum \ntherapy.\n97,103  \nCisplatin/paclitaxel , carboplatin/paclitaxel , \ntopotecan/paclitaxel/bevacizumab, topotecan/paclitaxel, and \ncisplatin/topotecan are also recommended as appropriate alternate \noptions under the other recommended regimens category.88,97,103- 106 A \nrandomized phase 3  study (GOG 169) in 264 patients compared \ncisplatin/paclitaxel versus cisplatin alone for metastatic, recurrent, or \npersistent cervical cancer. Patients receiving the 2- drug combination had a \nhigher response rate (36% vs. 19%) and improved PFS (4.8 vs. 2.8 months; P > .001) compared to single- agent cisplatin, although no \nimprovement was seen in median survival.\n97 Patients whose disease \nresponded to cisplatin/paclitaxel had a significant improvement in quality \nof life. Another randomized phase 3  study (GOG 179) in 294 patients \ninvestigated cisplatin/topotecan versus cisplatin alone for recurrent or \npersistent cervical cancer. The topotecan combination regimen was shown \nto be superior to single- agent cisplatin with respect to ORR (27% vs. 13% ; \nP = .004), PFS (4.6 vs. 2.9 months; P = .014), and median survival (9.4 vs. \n6.5 months; P = .017) .103 The FDA has approved cisplatin/topotecan for \nadvanced cervical cancer. However, the cisplatin/paclitaxel or \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel regimens are less toxic and easier to administer than \ncisplatin/topotecan.107  \nA phase 3  trial (GOG 204) compared four  cisplatin -doublet regimens \n(cisplatin/paclitaxel, cisplatin/topotecan, cisplatin/gemcitabine, and \ncisplatin/vinorelbine) in 513 patients with advanced metastatic or recurrent \ncervical cancer.106 The trial was closed early based on futility analysis, \nbecause it was apparent that the cisplatin/topotecan, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-16 cisplatin/gemcitabine, and cisplatin/vinorelbine regimens were not superior \nto the control arm of cisplatin/paclitaxel. No significant differences in OS  \nwere seen; however, the trends for response rate, PFS, and OS (12.9 vs. \n10 months) suggest that cisplatin/paclitaxel is superior to the other \nregimens. Cisplatin/paclitaxel was associated with less thrombocytopenia \nand anemia (but with more nausea, vomiting, infection, and alopecia) than \nthe other regimens.  While topotecan/paclitaxel was not shown to be \nsuperior to cisplatin/paclitaxel, it may be considered as an alternative in patients who are not candidates for cisplatin.\n88 \nBased on previous  studies, cisplatin/paclitaxel and carboplatin/paclitaxel \nhave become the most widely used systemic regimens for metastatic or \nrecurrent cervical cancer  and this is also recommended for vaginal cancer.  \nHowever, for patients who may not be candidates for taxanes, \ncisplatin/topotecan remains a reasonable alternative regimen.103  \nSecond -Line/Subsequent Systemic Therapy Options  \nImmunotherapy as Preferred, Second -Line/Subsequent Therapy   \nIncreasingly available data from several prospective studies have \ndemonstrated the effectiveness of immunotherapies or specific \nbiomarker -based therapies in the setting of disease progression and have \nsignificantly transformed the management of cervical cancer. In addition, many biomarker -specific therapies have demonstrated meaningful clinical \nefficacy and durability regardless of the underlying tumor type leading to an increase in tumor -agnostic regulatory approvals.  \nPembrolizumab as a Preferred, Second -Line/Subsequent Therapy   \nPembrolizumab is an FDA -approved therapy for patients with recurrent or \nmetastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after \nchemotherapy for PD -L1–positive tumors (CPS ≥1). It is also approved for \nunresectable or metastatic MSI -H/dMMR or TMB -H solid tumors that have \nprogressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. In the NCCN Guidelines, pembrolizumab \nmonotherapy is the preferred, second -line therapy option for \nrecurrent/metastatic MSI -H/dMMR or TM B-H or PD -L1–positive tumors \nbased on the results from KEYNOTE -028 (phase 1b) and KEYNOTE -158 \n(phase 2) trials.22,108,109 \nChemotherapy as Other Recommended, Second -Line/Subsequent Therapy   \nOther recommended agents that have shown responses or prolongation \nof PFS and may be useful as second -line therapy include \nbevacizumab,106 albumin- bound paclitaxel (ie, nab- paclitaxel),110 \ndocetaxel,111 fluorouracil,112 gemcitabine,113 ifosfamide,114,115 \nirinotecan,116 mitomycin,117 pemetrexed,118 topotecan,119,120 and \nvinorelbine.121 \nTisotumab vedotin- tftv (TV) is also recommended for second- line or \nsubsequent therapy for recurrent or metastatic vaginal cancer based on \nthe innovaTV -204 trial. This phase 2 single- arm study evaluated the \nefficacy of TV in 102 patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer \nwho had progressed on previous systemic therapy.122 At the median \nfollow- up of 10 months, the confirmed ORR was 24% (95% CI , 16–33), \nwhich included a 7% CR and 17% PR, and the median D oR was 8.3 \nmonths (95% CI, 4.2– NR). Following the results from the innovaTV -201 \nand innovaTV -204 trials that showed clinically  meaningful and durable \nactivity of TV  against pretreated recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer, the \nFDA granted accelerated approval for adult patients with recurrent or \nmetastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after \nchemotherapy.123 The results from the phase 3, randomized, \ninnovaTV -301/ENGOT -cx12/GOG -3057 trial were recently published at \nESMO Congress 2023.124 Among the 502 pa tients who were randomized \n(TV: 253; chemotherapy: 249); the TV arm had a 30% reduction in risk of \ndeath v ersus chemotherapy (HR , 0.70; 95% CI , 0.54–0.89; P = .0038) . \nThe results showed a median follow -up of 10.8 months (95% CI, 10.3–\n11.6),  with significantly longer median OS (11.5 months  [95% CI , 9.8–PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

PFS was superior in the TV \nversus  chemotherapy arm (HR , 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54– 0.82; P < .0001). \nConfirmed ORR was 17.8% and 5.2% in the TV and chemotherapy arms, \nrespectively (odds ratio [OR],  4.0; 95% CI, 2.1– 7.6; P < .0001 ).  \nCemiplimab is a PD -1–blocking monoclonal activity shown to have \nanti-tumor activity against cervical cancer. The phase 3, randomized, \nEmpower -Cervical- 1 clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of cemiplimab or \ninvestigator’s choice of chemotherapy (topotecan , vinorelbine, \ngemcitabine, irinotecan, or pemetrexed) in patients with recurrent or \nmetastatic cervical cancer who have progressed on prior therapy.125 The \ntrial enrolled 608 patients, who had previously received one or more lines \nof systemic therapy for recurrence, and they were randomized to either receive cemiplimab or chemotherapy. The median OS and PFS were \nsignificantly longer in the cemiplimab arm  than in the control arm (12 vs. \n8.5 months; HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56– 0.84; P < .001 and 2.8 vs. 2.9 \nmonths; HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63 –0.89; P < .001, respectively). Sixteen \npercent of the patients in the test arm achieved an OR (95% CI, 12.5–\n21.1) as compared to 6.3% (95% CI, 3.8 –9.6) in the chemotherapy arm. \nThe median OS in SCC and adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix in the cemiplimab versus chemotherapy arm was 11.1 versus 8.8 months (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 –0.91) and 13.3 versus 7 \nmonths (HR , 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36 –0.85), respectively, indicating that there \nis an OS benefit irrespective of histology. In a sub- analysis of the study, \nsamples from 254 patients were evaluated for PD -L1 expression to test \nthe efficacy of cemiplimab in tumors with PD -L1 expression of ≥1%. The \nmedian OS of cemiplimab- treated PD -L1–expressed tumors (CPS ≥1) \nversus chemotherapy was 13.9 versus 9.3 months (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, \n0.46– 1.05) while the OS benefit for tumors with low PD -L1 expression \n(CPS <1) was comparable in the t wo arms, although the study authors \nnoted that due to smaller size of the sub- group population, reliable \nassessment of the benefits could not be made. According to the patient -\nreported outcomes,\n126 cemiplimab conferred favorable differences in global health status (GHS)/quality of life and physical functioning \ncompared with chemotherapy among patients with recurrent cervical \ncancer, and clinically meaningful differences favoring cemiplimab in role \nfunctioning, appetite loss, and pain. In the rec ent version of the NCCN \nGuidelines for Vaginal Cancer, cemiplimab was moved to other \nrecommended regimens as a second -line/subsequent -therapy option.  \nBiomarker -Directed, Useful in Certain Circumstances, \nSecond -Line/Subsequent Therapy   \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Vaginal  Cancer have included a list of \nbiomarkers with their associated targeted treatments as second -line/ \nsubsequent therapies under “useful in certain circumstances” options. The \nPrinciples of P athology  section of the Guidelines provides  \nrecommendations for individual biomarkers that should be evaluated for \ntargeted therapy.  \nNivolumab for PD -L1–Positive Tumor   \nNivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, has shown efficacy in patients with \nrecurrent/metastatic cervical cancer who received at least one prior \nchemotherapy regimen. Based on Checkmate- 358 data ( see Prognostic \nand Predictive Biomarkers  section ), this recommendation is part of the \n1.2025 version of NCCN Guidelines for Vaginal Cancer.  \nTrastuzumab Deruxtecan for HER2 -Positive Tumor   \nAnother tumor -agnostic study evaluated the durability and clinically \nmeaningful response of trastuzumab deruxtecan across multiple \nHER2 -expressing (IHC 3+ or 2+) advanced solid tumor types in patients \nwho progressed on prior therapy or who have no satisfactory alternative \ntreatment options. HER2 expression is observed in a wide range of solid \ntumors and is an established prognostic biomark er for breast, gastric, and \ncolorectal cancers. Cervical cancer has shown a HER2 positivity rate of \napproximately 2% to 6% in the literature.31-33 Trastuzumab deruxtecan is \nan antibody -drug conjugate that contains the humanized anti -HER2 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-18 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab attached to the topoisomerase inhibitor \nderuxtecan.34  \nBased on the DESTINY -PanTumor02  trial (see Prognostic  and Predictive \nBiomarkers  section) , Version 1.2025  of the NCCN Guidelines for  Vaginal  \nCancer includes fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki as a category 2A, \nuseful in certain circumstances, second- line/subsequent therapy option for \nHER2 -positive tumors (IHC 3+ or 2+) . The Panel  recommends HER2 IHC \ntesting (with reflex to HER2 FISH for equivocal IHC) for vaginal cancer .   \nSelpercatinib for RET  Gene Fusion Tumor  \nSelpercatinib received tumor -agnostic approval by the FDA for patients \nwith solid tumors with a RET gene fusion that has progressed on or \nfollowing prior systemic treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. The NCCN Panel  recommends selpercatinib as a \nbiomarker -directed second- line/subsequent therapy under useful in certain \ncircumstances category for RET  gene fusion -positive tumors given its \nefficacy in tumor -agnostic population. The NCCN Panel also specified that \nRET gene fusion testing may be considered for p atients with vaginal  \ncancer  (see Prognostic  and Predictive Biomarkers  section) .  \nTRK Inhibitors for NTRK  Gene Fusion Tumor\n  \nIn addition to selpercatinib, other targeted therapy regimens included in \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Vaginal Cancer as biomarker -directed \nsecond- line/subsequent therapies that have been approved in a \ntumor -agnostic population are the TRK inhibitors, larotrectinib and \nentrectinib. Larotrectinib targets the TRK proteins that are encoded by the \ngenes NTRK1 , NTRK2 , and NTRK3 . NTRK gene fusions are found in \nabout 1% of all solid tumors. The NCCN Guidelines for Vaginal  Cancer \nrecommend larotrectinib, entrectinib, an d repotrectinib as a second- line or \nsubsequent, useful in certain circumstances option for NTRK  gene fusion -\npositive tumors based on FDA approval and several clinical trials (see \nPrognostic and Predictive Biomarkers  section).   Principles of Radiation Therapy  \nRT is preferred in the management of vaginal cancer  rather than surgery \nas primary treatment due to improved organ preservation. Preferred \nmodalities for definitive management include either concurrent pelvic \nchemoradiation (platinum -based) and brachytherapy or EBRT and \nbrachytherapy. The addition of brachytherapy to external beam is \npreferred as the combination has been shown to im prove control.  The \noverall treatment time should not extend beyond 8 weeks and treatment \ndelays and interruptions need to be mi nimized.  \nThe algorithm provides general RT dosage recommendations, which \nshould not be interpreted  as stand- alone recommendations  because RT \ntechniques and clinical judgment are an essential part of developing an \nappropriate treatment regimen.  \nSince vaginal cancer is rare, prospective trials of patients with vaginal \ncancer have not been feasible, and single- institutional reports of clinical \noutcomes spanning several decades have been the evidence for current \ntreatment recommendations. The management of vaginal cancer is \ncurrently extrapolated from prospective studies of cervical cancer, due to \ntheir similarit ies in disease etiology.127 The radiation guidance and \nrecommendations for cervical cancer can be extrapolated to vaginal cancer and the principles of post -chemoradiation tumor response \nevaluation are largely analogous.\n46 \nRadiation Treatment Planning  \nTechnologic advances in imaging, computer treatment planning systems, \nand linear accelerator technology have enabled the more precise delivery \nof radiation doses to the pelvis. However, physical accuracy of dose \ndelivery must be matched to a clear understanding of tumor extent, \npotential pathways of spread, and historical patterns of locoregional \nrecurrence to avoid geographic misses.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-19 Pelvic MRI with and without IV contrast and vaginal gel to assess local \ndisease extent is the preferred workup. The n eck/chest/abdomen/pelvis/  \ngroin FDG -PET/CT is preferred to evaluate metastatic disease. The \nchest/abdomen/pelvis CT is also recommended. Other initial imaging \nshould be based on symptomatology and clinical concern for metastatic \ndisease.  \nCT-based treatment planning with conformal blocking and dosimetry is \nconsidered standard care for EBRT. As with cervical cancer, FIGO \nencourages the use of advanced imaging modalities (CT, MRI , and PET) \nto guide therapy, although in under -resourced settings the imaging \nfindings may not be used to determine the stage to preserve the FIGO \nsystem.  \nIn patients who are not surgically staged, FDG -PET imaging is useful to \nhelp define the nodal volume of coverage and may be useful \npostoperatively to confirm removal of abnormal nodes .128 FDG –PET/CT \nimaging is preferred at 3  to 4 months after RT . MRI is also needed if FDG -\nPET/CT is difficult to obtain or needed for clarification or exam findings. \nRepeating imaging is also recommended if clinically indicated. IMRT \ntechnique is preferred to minimize toxicities in definitive treatment of the \npelvis with or without para- aortic treatment. Adaptive planning with \nimage- guided RT (IGRT) , especially if IMRT is utilized , is encouraged. \nBrachytherapy is an important  component of definitive therapy in patients \nwith vaginal  cancer , although brachytherapy alone is not recommended for \nmost tumors, even early -stage, due to a high recurrence rate.129 \nBrachytherapy is typically combined with EBRT in an integrated treatment plan. SBRT allows delivery of very high doses of focused EBRT  and may \nbe applied to isolated metastatic sites.\n130,131 Local ablative therapies such \nas SBRT are  recommended for patients with stage IVB disease  or patients \nwith recurrent distant metastases, with limited disease.    Concepts regarding the gross tumor  volume (GTV), clinical target volume \n(CTV), planning target volume (PTV), organs at risk (OARs) , and \ndose- volume histogram (DVH) have been defined for use in image -guided \nadaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) .132,133  \nThere are increasing efforts to use and standardize image- based \nvolumetric brachytherapy approaches using MR I, CT, or ultrasound . \nInternational validation efforts with  different studies including the \nEMBRACE- I study , which is a benchmark study that represents a positive \nbreakthrough in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer , are \nunderway .134- 140  \nBrachytherapy  \nBrachytherapy is encouraged for all suitable patients with primary vaginal \ncancer. Orton et al141 evaluated the impact of brachytherapy on survival in \npatients with vaginal cancer who received radiotherapy. Based on the two retrospective cohorts (women who received EBRT alone and those who \nreceived brachytherapy [ alone or in combination of EBRT] ), median OS for \npatients receiving EBRT alone was 3.6  years (95% CI, 3.0– 4.2 years) \nversus 6 years . Cox proportional hazard model revealed decreased risk of \ndeath among patients who  received brachytherapy in the matched cohort \n(HR, 0.77; 95% CI , 0.68– 0.86). Bra chytherapy reduced risk of death \namong patients in all stage groups , including 1 year (95% CI , 5.2–7.2 \nyears) for patients receiving brachytherapy ( P ≤ .001). Brachytherapy  was \nalso associated with a reduction in risk of death for all FIGO stages.   \nThe choice of the brachytherapy modality is based on the residual tumor \nthickness following pelvic RT. For residual disease measuring <5 mm in \nthickness, vaginal cylinder brachytherapy is appropriate, whereas for bulky residual tumors, interstitial implants are performed. The most common \nbrachytherapy modalities used in clinical practice are low  dose -rate (LDR), \nhigh dose- rate (HDR), and pulsed dose -rate delivery.\n127 HDR and LDR PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-20 intracavitary brachytherapy have comparable local control, survival, and \ncomplication rates.142 For cylinder brachytherapy, the full vaginal length \ntypically receives a cumulative dose of 60  to 65 Gy, while the region of the \ntumor is boosted an additional 10 to 20 Gy.143 For interstitial \nbrachytherapy, the cumulative delivered dose ranges from 70 to 85 Gy, \nand the recommended dose schedules are described elsewhere.144 For \n3D treatment planning, simulation with MRI or fusion of MR I images with \nCT simulation at the time of interstitial brachytherapy has been reported \nwith favorable outcomes.145 For CT- based planning, the placement of \nfiducial markers may be used to demarcate the superior, inferior, and \nlateral extent of the tumor for contouring purposes. 127 \nIn a large retrospective multicenter study, IGABT for primary vaginal cancer demonstrated a high local control\n with acceptable morbidity. The \nresults from this study illustrated that IGABT could play an important role in the treatment of vaginal cancer. This study assessed outcomes \nfollowing the nowadays standing treatment for primary vaginal cancer with \nradio(chem o)therapy and IGABT in a multicenter patient cohort. \nRetrospective data collection included tumor and treatment characteristics \nof patients treat ed with CT –MRI-assisted -based IGABT.  At a median \nfollow- up of 29 months ( interquartile range [ IQR], 25–57), 2- and 5-year \nlocal control were 86% and 83%; DFS was 73% and 66%, and OS was \n79% and 68%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed improved local \ncontrol in patients with T2– T4 tumors if >80 Gy equivalent dose at 2 Gy  \n(EQD2 ) α/β10 was delivered to the CTV at the time of brachytherapy.  \nFerrigno et al published a report on the comparative outcome of patients \nwith cervical cancer treated with LDR and HDR brachytherapy.\n146 In this \nretrospective analysis, 190 patients were treated with LDR brachytherapy,  \nand 118 patients were treated with HDR brachytherapy.  \nThe OS, DFS, and local control  at 5 years were better in the LDR group \n(69% vs. 55%, P  = .007; 73% vs. 56%, P  = .002; and 74% vs. 65%; P  = .04, respectively) for all stages combined. However, for clinical stages I \nand II, no differences were seen in OS, DFS, and local control a t 5 years \nbetween the two groups. For clinical stage III, although OS and DFS at 5 \nyears were better in the LDR than in the HDR group (46% vs. 36%, P  = \n.04 and 49% vs. 37%, P  = .03, respectively), the 5- year probability of \nrectal complications was higher in the LDR group than in the HDR group \n(16% vs. 8%, P  = .03).  \nThus, similar outcomes were observed for patients who were in  stages I \nand II treated with either HDR or LDR brachytherapy. Although lower OS \nand DFS were observed for patients who were stage III treated with HDR \nbrachytherapy, fewer  late rectal complications were observed in this \ngroup. These findings were probably the result of the relatively low HDR \nbrachytherapy dose delivered at Point A.  \nFor very -early -stage vaginal cancers (<5 mm) not requiring EBRT, \nintracavitary brachytherapy alone may be used.  The LDR data suggest \nimproved outcomes with doses of approximately 60– 70 Gy EQD2 to the \nvaginal surface. For invasive cancers, common HDR fractionation \nregimens after 45 Gy to pelvis include 4.5 to 5.5 Gy x 5 fx to the HR -CTV.  \nEither less fractionated or more fractionated regimens may be used, such \nas 7 Gy x 3 fx or 3 Gy x 9  to 10 fx. Modulation of dose takes into \nconsideration tumor location, extent of disease, response to EBRT, brachytherapy technique (intracavitary or interstitial), relationship to \nsurrounding OARs, as well as other factors. The HDR data are more \nvaried, with total doses in the range of 50 to 60 Gy EQD2. The appropriate \ndose for each case needs to be individualized.  \nExternal Beam Radiation Therapy/Intensity- Modulated Radiation \nTherapy \nDefinitive RT, which consists of a combination of EBRT and \nbrachytherapy , has been shown to yield excellent outcomes .\n129 The PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-21 advantage of RT  is the preservation of the vagina as well as other organs. \nBrachytherapy alone is not recommended for most tumors, even early -\nstage, due to a high recurrence rate.  \nFrank et al129 evaluated the outcomes  and describe clinical treatment \nguidelines for patients with vaginal cancer treated with definitive RT . In this \nsingle -institution report , a total of 193 patients with vaginal cancer treated \nwith definitive RT  were reviewed to obtain patient information including \ntreatment characteristics  and s urviving patients were followed for a \nmedian of 137 months.  \nAt 5 years, disease -specific survival ( DSS) rates were 85% (stage I ), 78% \n(stage II ), and 58% ( stage III –IVA disease)  (P = .0013)  and pelvic disease \ncontrol rates were 86% ( stage I ), 84% (stage II ), and 71% (stage III –IVA) \n(P = .027). The predominant mode of relapse after definitive RT  was \nlocoregional (68% and 83%, respectively, for patients with stages I –II or \nIII–IVA) disease.   \nA unified approach to techniques and prescription/fractionation schedules \nfor both EBRT and IGABT is required and RetroEMBRACE and \nEMBRACE I studies ha ve demonstrated that clinical outcome is related to \ndose prescription and technique. The EMBRACE II study is an \ninterventional and observational multicenter  study that aims to benchmark \na high level of local, nodal,  and systemic control while limiting morbidity, \nusing an advanced target volume selection and contouring protocol for \nEBRT and a multiparametric b rachytherapy dose prescription protocol for \nbrachytherapy, and use of advanced EBRT (IMRT and IGRT) and brachytherapy ( intracavitary/ interstitial ) techniques .\n147 \nThe addition of brachytherapy to external pelvic radiation increases \nsurvival in stages III –IV. A retrospective analysis of patients with primary \nsquamous, adenocarcinoma,  and adenosquamous carcinoma of the \nvagina were identified from the Mayo Clinic Cancer Registry (1998– 2018) to analyze clinical characteristics and survival of patients with primary \nvaginal cancer by Yang et al.148 In a total of 124 patients, primary surgery \nin stage I –II patients had similar survival outcomes as compared to \nprimary radiation, but postoperative RT rate was 55%. Brachytherapy \nalone was associated with a high local recurrence rate (80%) in stage I –II \npatients. The addition of brachytherapy had improved 5- year PFS and \nDSS compared to  EBRT alone in patients with stage III –IVA disease (P < \n.001).   \nGeneral recommendations for radiation volumes and doses for both EBRT \nand brachytherapy are discussed in the algorithm.  \nExternal Beam Boost  \nIntensity -modulated RT is becoming more widely available; however, \nissues regarding target definition, patient and target immobilization, tissue \ndeformation, toxicity, and reproducibility remain to be validated.149- 156 \nDose -escalated IMRT (limiting V55 to below 15 cm3 and limiting the dose \nto duodenum) can safely and effectively treat para- aortic nodal disease in \ngynecologic malignancies reducing the risk of late duodenal toxicity .157 \nAmong 105 patients with gynecologic primary tumors and treated to a nodal CTV to 45 to 50.4 Gy with a boost to 60 to 66 Gy, only 9  of 105 \npatients (2 of 38 cervical patients) experienced duodenal toxicity with \n3-year actuarial rate of any duodenal toxicity of 11.7%. IMRT technique \ncan reduce acute and chronic GI and hematologic toxicity.   \nAn international , multicenter , phase 2 clinical trial (INTERTECC- 2) \nevaluated acute hematologic and GI toxicity for 83 patients with cervical \ncancer who received weekly cisplatin concurrently with once -daily IMRT, \nfollowed by intracavitary brachytherapy .\n158 The primary endpoint was the \noccurrence of either acute grade ≥3 neutropenia or clinically significant GI \ntoxicity within 30 days of completing chemoradiation therapy.

NCCN Guidelines®, and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-22 the incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia and clinically significant GI toxicity \nwas 19.3% (95% CI , 12.2%–29.0%) and 12.0% (95% CI , 6.7%–20.8%), \nrespectively. Compared with patients treated without image -guided IMRT \n(n = 48), those treated with image -guided IMRT (n  = 35) had a significantly \nlower incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia (8.6% vs . 27.1%; 2- sided χ2;  P = \n.035).   \nSeveral retrospective analyses suggest that prolonged RT treatment duration has an adverse effect on outcome.\n159- 163 Extending the overall \ntreatment beyond 6 to 8 weeks can result in approximately a 0.5% to 1% decrease in pelvic control and cause specific survival for each extra day of \noverall treatment time. Thus, although no prospective randomized trials \nhave been per formed, it is generally accepted that the entire RT course \n(including both EBRT and brachytherapy components) should be \ncompleted in a timely fashion (within 8 weeks); delays or splits in the \nradiation treatment should be avoided whenever possible.  \nReirradiation  \nTechniques for re- irradiation may include IORT, intracavitary or interstitial \nbrachytherapy, SBRT, IMRT, or proton therapy .\n164- 166 Such cases are \nhighly customized and depend on the target, proximity to critical organs, \nprevious RT dose, extent of overlap, and time intervals since prior RT. The \nappropriate dose for each case needs to be individualized.  \nIORT is a specialized technique that delivers a single, highly focused dose of radiation to an at -risk tumor bed or isolated unresectable residual \ndisease during an open surgical procedure.\n141 It is particularly useful in \npatients with recurrent disease within a previously radiated volume. During \nIORT, overlying normal tissue (such as bowel or other viscera) can be \nmanually displaced from the region at risk. IORT is typically delivered with \nelectrons, brachytherapy, or miniaturized x -ray sources using preformed \napplicators of variable sizes matched to the surgically defined region at risk, which further constrains the area and depth of radiation exposure to \navoid surrounding normal structures.  For patients with locoregional \nrecurrence who have received prior EBRT with/without brachytherapy, \nIORT is recommended as NCCN category 3 with major NCCN \ndisagreement that the intervention is appropriate.  \nOther techniques for reirradiation may include intracavitary or interstitial brachytherapy, SBRT, IMRT, or proton therapy. Such cases are highly \nindividualized and depend on the target, proximity to critical organs, \nprevious RT dose, extent of overlap, and  time intervals since prior RT. The \nappropriate dose for each case needs to be individualized.  \nConcurrent Chemoradiation  \nBased on a small retrospective series and adaptation from cervical \ncancer, concurrent chemoradiation  therapy  (CCRT) may be used in \nvaginal cancer.  \nIn a single -institution report, clinical outcomes in patients with primary \nvaginal cancer with RT or CCRT were reviewed.\n167 A total of 51 patients \nwere treated with RT alone; 20 patients were treated with CCRT, \nrecurrences were analyzed,  and OS and DFS rates were estimated.  The \n3-year OS of the RT group was 56% compared to 76% in the CCRT \ngroup  (log-rank P = .037) . The 3 -year DFS rate was 43% in the RT group  \ncompared to 73% in the CCRT group (log- rank P = .011). Twenty -three \npatients (45%) in the RT group had a relapse at any site compared to 3 \n(15%) in the CRT group ( P = .027). Regarding  the sites of first relapse, \n10 patients (14%) had local only, 4 (6%) had local and regional, 9 (13%) \nhad regional only, 1 (1%) had regional and distant, and 2 (3%) had \ndistant -only relapse. Concurrent chemotherapy should be considered for \npatients with vaginal cancer.  \nThe adoption rate of CCRT and its survival impact were analyzed using \nthe National Cancer Datab ase (NCDB) , which included patients PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-23 diagnosed with vaginal cancer who received definitive RT.168 Of the \n13,689 patients identified, 8222 (60.1%) received RT. Of these, 3932 \n(47.8%) received CCRT and its use increased from 20.8% to 59.1% \n(1998 –2011). Median OS  is longer with CCRT compared to radiation \nalone (56.2 vs. 41.2 months, P < .0005). This large, national cohort study \nemphasized  the increased use of CCRT for patients with vaginal cancer \nand its association with a significant survival improvement . \nChemoradiation with brachytherapy  is the preferred regimen for patients \nwith vaginal cancer with stage II –IVA disease .  \nNormal Tissue Considerations  \nPlanning for RT in vaginal  cancer must consider  the potential impact on \nsurrounding critical structures, such as rectum, bladder, sigmoid, small bowel, and bone. Acute effects ( ie, diarrhea, bladder irritation, fatigue) \noccur to some degree in most patients undergoing radiation and are typically magnified by concurrent chemotherapy. However, acute effects \ncan often be managed with medications and supportive care, and they \ngenerally  resolve soon after completion of radiation. To avoid \ntreatment -related menop ause, ovarian transposition can be considered \nbefore pelvic RT in select young patients (<45 years with early -stage \ndisease).\n169- 171  \nLate complications from RT  in patients with gynecologic cancer may \ninclude potential injury to bladder, rectum, bowel, and pelvic skeletal \nstructures.172 The risk of major complications ( eg, obstruction, \nfibrosis/necrosis, fistula) is related to the volume, total dose, dose per \nfraction, and specific intrinsic radiosensitivity of the normal tissue that is \nirradiated.173- 175 Careful blocking in order to minimize normal tissue \nexposure while maintaining tumor coverage is critical for optimal \noutcomes. In addition, patient -related conditions ( ie, inflammatory bowel \ndisease, collagen- vascular disease, multiple abdominal/pelvic surgeries, history of pelvic inflammatory disease, diabetes) influence determination of \nradiation dose and volumes.   \nFor most patients, it is generally accepted that the whole pelvis can tolerate an EBRT  dose of 4 5 to 50 Gy. Gross disease in the parametria or \nunresected nodes may be treated with tightly contoured external -beam \nboosts to 65 to 70 Gy. Care should be taken to minimize dose to \nuninvolved and out -of-field external genitalia when possible but without \ncompromising coverage of the PTV. Brachytherapy to reach 70– 80 Gy \nEQD2 total dose is generally recommended, with lower dose ranges of \n70–75 Gy  considered in the lower vagina, and 75 –80 Gy total dose in the \nupper vagina. For bulky or poorly responsive disease in the upper vagina, \ndose escalation ≤85 Gy may be considered. Some clinicians treat the \nentire vaginal surface to 60 Gy cumulative dose, followed by tumor boost \nto 70– 80 Gy, while others treat only the lesion plus a margin. Careful \nattention should be paid to dose tolerance of vaginal mucosa. The distal vagina has a lower tolerance than the proximal vagina. Brachytherapy \nplanning is highl y individualized and should incorporate information from \npre-EBRT and pre -brachytherapy imaging (preferably MRI), clinical \ndrawings, fiducials, and exam findings. Careful understanding of vaginal \nanatomy and distribution of disease is required. Image- guided \nbrachytherapy is strongly encouraged, with adaptation of volumes as the \ntumor responds. Tumor extent, location, and response must all be \nconsidered when choosing the brachytherapy approach.  \nNormal tissue dose constraint guidelines for vaginal  cancer have been  \nadded to the NCCN G uidelines  for Vaginal Cancer . Although the \nsuggested dose constraints are provided in the Guidelines, the NCCN \nPanel  recommends that clinicians must balance the risks of normal tissue \ntoxicity with tumor control.

NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 \nVaginal  Cancer  \nMS-24 Drug Reactions  \nVirtually all drugs have the potential to cause adverse reactions, either \nduring or after infusion.176 In vaginal  cancer treatment, drugs that more \ncommonly cause adverse reactions include carboplatin, cisplatin, docetaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, and paclitaxel. Most of these drug \nreactions are mild infusion reactions ( ie, skin reactions, cardiovascular \nreactions, respiratory or throat tightness), but more severe allergic reactions ( ie, life-threatening anaphylaxis) can occur.\n177,178 In addition, \npatients can have severe infusion reactions and mild allergic reactions. Infusion reactions are more common with paclitaxel.\n179 Allergic reactions \n(ie, true drug allergies) are more common with platinum agents ( eg, \ncisplatin).179,180 Management of drug reactions is discussed in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Ovarian Cancer .179 Importantly, patients who experienced \nsevere life -threatening reactions should not receive the implicated agent \nagain unless evaluated by an allergist or specialist in drug desensitization. If a mild allergic reaction previously occurred and it is appropriate to \nreadminister the drug, a desensitization regimen is recommended even if \nthe symptoms have resolved. Various desensitization regimens have been published and should be followed.\n180-182 Patients must be desensitized with \neach infusion if they have had a previous reaction. Almost all patients can be desensitized.\n176 To maximize safety, patients should be desensitized in \nthe intensive care unit.176  \nGynecologic Survivorship  \nTreatment for gynecologic cancer typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, RT, and/or immunotherapy, which may \ncause acute, short term, and long- term toxicities. Surgical approaches \nmay be extensive and cause adhesions to form, which in turn may cause pain and contribute to the development of small bowel obstruction, urinary \nor GI complications (eg, incontinence, diarrhea), pelvic floor dysfunction \n(manifested by a variety of urinary, bowel, and/or sexual effects), and lymphedema. Chemotherapy agents vary, though commonly used \nregimens may pose a significant risk of neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, \ncognitive dysfunction, and the development of hematologic cancers. Long -\nterm estrogen deprivation may cause symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and bone loss. RT may cause long- term complications \n(eg, fibrosis, stenosis, vulvovaginal atrophy) and may predispose patients to subsequent cancers of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and/or underlying \norgans that are proximal to the radiation field. Use of immunotherapy \nagents in gynecologic cancers is emerging, and to date, long- term effects \nof these treatments are unknown.  \nFollowing completion of treatment, all gynecologic cancer survivors should \nreceive regular general medical care that focuses on managing chronic \ndiseases (eg, depression, diabetes, hypertension), monitoring \ncardiovascular risk factors, receiving recommended vaccinations, and \nencouraging adoption of a healthy lifestyle (eg, promoting exercise, \nsmoking cessation). To assess the late and long- term effects of \ngynecologic cancers, clinicians should comprehensively document the \npatient’s history, including prior treatment history, and conduct a thorough \nphysical examination followed by necessary imaging and/or laboratory \ntesting. As most treatments for gynecologic cancers will cause sexual \ndysfunction, early menopause, and infertility, special attention to the \nresultant medical and psychosocial implications is needed. All patients, \nwhether sexually active or not, should be asked about genitourinary symptoms, including vulvovaginal dryness. Post -radiation use of vaginal \ndilators and moisturizers is recommended. Psychosocial effects may include psychological (eg, depression, anxiety, fear of recurrence, altered \nbody image), financial (eg, return to work, insurance concerns), and \ninterpersonal (eg, relationships, sexuality, intimacy). Patients should be \nreferred to appropriate specialty providers (eg, physical therapy, pelvic \nfloor therapy, sexual therapy, psychotherapy) as needed, based on prior \ntreatment history and assessed risk of developing late effects and/or PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.

Communication and coordination with all clinicians \ninvolved in the care of survivors, including primary care clinicians, is \ncritical. Providing survivors with a summary of their treatment and \nrecommendations for follow- up is also recommended. To this end, the \nSGO has developed templates for gynecologic cancer -specific \nsurvivorship care plans to aid survivors and their clinicians in summarizing \ncancer history, treatments received, possible side effects, and \nrecommended follow- up. \nBest Supportive Care \nPatients with refractory systemic cancer warrant a comprehensive \ncoordinated approach involving hospice care, pain consultants, and \nemotional and spiritual support, individualized to the situation (see the \nNCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care ). \nSummary  \nIn summary, vaginal cancer tends to be associated with older age (>60 \nyears). The most common signs and symptoms of vaginal cancer include bleeding, discharge, and urine retention; in some cases, vaginal cancer  is \nidentif ied by rectal symptoms like constipation or blood in the stool. The \nprimary technique to detect vaginal can cer is pelvic examination. Many of \nthe recommendations for staging, treatment , and follow -up of primary \nvaginal cancer are derived from cervical cancer and they have generalizability to vaginal cancer due to similar tumor biology. If the \ndiagnosis can be made  in an early stage of vaginal cancer, then RT  is the \npreferred recommendation, as well as  surgery in select patients. EBRT, \nEBRT with brachytherapy, and CCRT  with brachytherapy are \nrecommended in the later stages of the disease. Prevent ive measures \nsuch as HPV vaccination , regular gynecologic examinations, and tests like \nPap cytology  and cervicography aid in prevention and early diagnosis  of \nthe disease .\n7 The hope is that immunization against HPV will prevent persistent infection and therefore prevent specific HPV -associated  \ncancer s, including vaginal cancer .8,183,184 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:24 PM.
