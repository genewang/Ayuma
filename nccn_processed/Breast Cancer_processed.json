A SLNB should also can be considered in the setting of 1) mastectomy for DCIS, where there is a small risk of \ndetecting invasive disease in the mastectomy specimen or 2) excision in an anatomic location compromising the performance of a future SLNB procedure .\n• Footnote h added: A SLNB may be considered in the setting of 1) mastectomy for DCIS, 2) excision in an anatomic location compromising the performance of \na future SLNB procedure 3) oncoplastic breast conserving surgery (see BINV-D for appropriate candidates for SLNB).\n• Footnote m, last sentence revised: Select patients with \"low\" risk DCIS may be considered suitable for APBI/PBI or  omission of RT (endocrine therapy alone, if \nall RTOG 9804 criteria are met: screen-detected, grade 1–2, size ≤2.5 cm, margins ≥3 mm).\nDCIS-2\n• Surveillance/Follow-up, 2nd bullet revised: First mammogram 6–12 mo, after end of RT, if given, or after BCS therapy  (category 2B) if no RT is given \nand annually thereafter\n• Footnote q revised: The standard dose of tamoxifen is 20 mg/day for 5 years. Low-dose tamoxifen (5 mg/day or 10 mg/every other day, for 3 years) is \nan option in patients who are symptomatic or unwilling to take standard 20-mg dosing.  Low-dose tamoxifen (5 mg per day or 10 mg every other day for \n3–5 years) is an option if patient is symptomatic on the 20-mg dose or if patient is unwilling or unable to take standard-dose 20 mg per day tamoxifen \n[10 mg every other day since 5-mg dose is not available in the United States].

This is a population of patients with breast \ncancer that was  not studied in available  randomized trials. The decision for use of trastuzumab therapy in this cohort of patients  must balance with the \nknown toxicities of trastuzumab, such as cardiac toxicity, and the uncertain, absolute benefits that may exist with trastuzumab therapy . \n• Footnote ii revised: Adjuvant chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab can be considered for pT1,N0,M0, HER2-positive cancers, \nparticularly if the primary cancer is HR-negative.  The absolute benefit of HER2-based systemic chemo therapy is likely  negligible in patients with HR-\npositive cancers and tumor size bordering on T1mic (<1 mm), when the estimated recurrence risk is less than 5%  and endocrine therapy remains a \nviable option for systemic treatment. (Also for subsequent pages)\nBINV-6\n• Middle pathway, column 3, new node added: Determine if candidate for chemotherapy (Also for BINV-7)\n\u0017New branch point added: Not a candidate for chemotherapy (Also for BINV-7)\n• Footnote removed: Addition of 1 year of adjuvant olaparib is an option for select patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutation after completion of adjuvant \nchemotherapy. See BINV-L. In patients eligible for adjuvant olaparib and abemaciclib or ribociclib the optimal sequence is not known. (Also for BINV-8 \nand 10)\nBINV-7\n• Not a candidate for chemotherapy, last column, new node added: Adjuvant endocrine therapy ± ovarian suppression/ablation. Consider adjuvant \nribociclib for eligible patients. See BINV-K 2 of 3 for eligibility criteria. \nBINV-8\n• Bottom pathway revised: Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy ± ovarian suppression/ablation (category 1). Consider adjuvant \nabemaciclib or ribociclib and/or adjuvant olaparib if germline BRCA1/2 mutation for eligible patients. See BINV-K 2 of 3 and BINV-M for eligibility criteria. \nBINV-9\n• pT1c-pT3 pathway revised: Adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab (category 1) (± pertuzumab for pT2-T3) \nBINV-10\n• Last column, middle pathway revised: Consider adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant olaparib if germline BRCA1/2 mutation, see BINV-M for eligibility \ncriteria.\n• Last column, bottom pathway revised: Adjuvant chemotherapy (category 1) and adjuvant olaparib if germline BRCA1/2 mutation, see BINV-M for \neligibility criteria.\nBINV-14\n• Footnote t added: Special Considerations for Breast Cancer in Males (Sex Assigned at Birth) (BINV-J).

Tissue-based assays have greater sensitivity for some alterations , but ctDNA may reflect tumor heterogeneity more accurately. If one \nspecimen is negative for actionable biomarkers, testing on the alternative specimen can be considered.\n• Footnote kkk added: In the setting of oligometastatic breast cancer, the currently available data do not support ablative metastasis-directed RT (ie, stereotactic body \nradiation therapy [SBRT]) for extending overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS).

After mastectomy, repeat SLNB may be considered although there are limited data in this setting. In patients who had a prior ALND or mastectomy, \nrepeat SLNB with lymphoscintigraphy may be considered rather than ALND (Poodt IGM, et al.

Individuals with breast implants have a very small risk of developing BIA-ALCL (average 7–9 years after implantation) and BIA-SCC (average 22 years \nafter implantation). \n\u0017Sub-bullet 4 revised:The majority of cases of BIA-ALCL have been seen in textured implants, while BIA-SCC is associated with either smooth or textured implants. \nRare cases of implant associated diffuse large B-cell lymphomas have also been reported. There exists an association between certain types of textured breast \nimplants and BIA-ALCL. The risk appears to vary based on the method of texturing. Patients with a past or current history of textured implants should follow up with \ntheir reconstructive surgeon. \nBINV-I (1 of 3)\n• Optimizing Delivery of Individual Therapy, bullet 3 added: In the setting of oligometastatic breast cancer, the currently available data do not support ablative metastasis-\ndirected RT (ie, SBRT) for extending overall survival OS or PFS to provide more durable local control and pain relief. \n• Whole Breast Radiation, bullet 2, sub-bullet 2 revised: A boost to the tumor bed is recommended in patients at higher risk for recurrence. Typical boost doses are 10–\n16 Gy in 4–8 fractions.  The boost can be given sequentially after whole breast RT or as a simultaneous integrated boost. Typical boost doses when given sequentially \nare 10–16 Gy in 4–8 fractions. When given concurrently, the whole breast should receive 40 Gy in 15 fractions and the lumpectomy site should receive 48 Gy in 15 \nfractions.\n• Footnote a added: Vicini FA, Winter K, Freedman GM, et al.

The distinction between HER2 test results of IHC 0 with no membrane staining, IHC 0+ with faint, partial membrane staining in \n≤10%, IHC 1+, or 2+/ISH negative is currently clinically relevant for therapy selection. (Also for BINV-Q 3)  \n• Footnote e added: Systemic chemotherapy (eg, oral chemotherapy) is generally preferred in the first-line setting. Selection of systemic therapy versus fam-trastuzumab-nxki for first-line \ntherapy should be individualized based on clinical features and patient preference. \n• Footnote f revised: Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki may be considered  used for in a later line for HER2 IHC 0+ 1+ or 2+/ISH negative, previously treated with at least one line of \nendocrine-based therapy in the metastatic setting.  if not used in second–line.  Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. Regular \nmonitoring for this serious side effect is recommended. For patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis, there are no data on managing safety or toxicity of this drug in a trial.\n• Footnote h added: Datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk did not meet the OS endpoint in the TROPION-Breast01 trial. Whereas the previously approved antibody drug conjugates (ADC), fam-\ntrastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and sacituzumab govitecan have shown a benefit in OS in randomized phase III trials. The benefit of using datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk in patients with \nprior ADC treatment are not known as the TROPION-Breast01 trial did not include patients with prior ADC treatment.\nBINV-Q (3 of 15)\n• Footnote j revised: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy may be used in patients who have received at least 1 prior regimen in the metastatic setting.  it may be considered for later line if not used \nas second line therapy.\n• Footnote k added: Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan may be considered in a later line for HER2 IHC 0+, 1+ or 2+/ISH negative, if not used in second line or may be considered first line \ntherapy when disease has progressed during or within 6 months after completing adjuvant chemotherapy . Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki is associated with interstitial lung disease \n(ILD)/pneumonitis. Regular monitoring for this serious side effect is recommended. For patients with a history of ILD/pneumonitis, there are no data on managing safety or toxicity of this \ndrug in a trial. \nBINV-Q (4 of 15)\n• Abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant and trastuzumab (for HR+ only) was added as a category 2B recommendation.\nBINV-Q (5 of 15)\n• Footnote removed and added to table: Sequential single agents are preferred, but chemotherapy combinations may be used in select patients with high tumor burden, rapidly progressing \ndisease, and visceral crisis.\n• Footnote removed: Alternative taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel) may be substituted for select patients due to medical necessity (ie, hypersensitivity reaction). If \nsubstituted for weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, then the weekly dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel should not exceed 125 mg/m2.\n• Footnote removed: Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia for patients receiving chemotherapy . Results may be less effective with anthracycline \ncontaining regimens. \n• Footnote removed: Consider cryotherapy of hands and feet to decrease the risk of peripheral neuropathy when receiving taxane therapies.

IBC is a clinical syndrome in patients with invasive breast cancer that is characterized by erythema and edema (peau d'orange) of a third or more of the skin of the breast. The differential \ndiagnosis includes cellulitis of the breast or mastitis. Pathologically , a tumor is typically present in the dermal lymphatics of the involved skin, but dermal lymphatic involvement is neither \nrequired, nor sufficient by itself for a diagnosis of IBC.\nIBC-2\n• Footnote i revised: The accurate assessment of in-breast tumor or regional lymph node response to preoperative systemic therapy is difficult, and should include physical examination \nand performance of imaging studies (mammogram and/or breast ultrasound and/or  breast MRI) that were abnormal at the time of initial tumor staging. Selection of imaging methods prior \nto surgery should be determined by the multidisciplinary team. MRI is more accurate than mammography for assessing tumor response to preoperative therapy.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

Since a survival advantage has not been demonstrated, individual consideration of risks and \nbenefits is important.\np The use of a bisphosphonate (PO/IV) or denosumab is acceptable to maintain or improve bone mineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural \nor induced) patients receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy. Optimal duration of either therapy has not been established. Benefits from duration beyond \n3 years or optimal duration beyond 3 years is not known. Factors to consider for duration of anti-osteoporosis therapy include bone mineral density , response to \ntherapy, and risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture. There are case reports of spontaneous fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Patients treated with a \nbisphosphonate or denosumab should undergo a dental examination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and should take supplemental calcium \nand vitamin D. \nq Low-dose tamoxifen (5 mg per day or 10 mg every other day for 3–5 years) is an option if patient is symptomatic on the 20-mg dose or if patient is unwilling or \nunable to take standard-dose 20 mg per day tamoxifen [10 mg every other day since 5-mg dose is not available in the United States].

Suspicious \nfindings on physical examination or surveillance imaging might warrant a shorter interval between mammograms.\neee  The use of estrogen, progesterone, or selective ER modulators to treat osteoporosis or osteopenia in patients with breast cancer is discouraged. The use of a \nbisphosphonate (oral/IV) or denosumab is acceptable to maintain or to improve bone mineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural or \ninduced) patients receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy. Optimal duration of either therapy has not been established. Benefits of duration beyond 3 years \nor optimal duration beyond 3 years is not known. Factors to consider for duration of anti-osteoporosis therapy include bone mineral density , response to therapy, \nand risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture.

A \ncomprehensive evaluation is essential, as these symptoms could indicate \ndisease progression, treatment effects, or other unrelated medical issues. \n• Additional health monitoring, management, and immunizations should be \nperformed as appropriate to the prognosis under the care of a PCP.\n• Patients are encouraged to maintain a therapeutic relationship with a PCP \nthroughout their lifetime. \nTreatment Management and Supportive Care\n• Regular follow-up discussions about goals of care and care coordination may \nbe necessary to improve both survival and quality of life. Engaging patients in \nthese discussions, including therapy cessation, ensures that care aligns with \ntheir values and preferences. \n• Surveillance and follow-up plans should be individualized for all patients, \nparticularly older patients, considering comorbidities, functional status, and \nlife expectancy. Personalization of care is key to managing the complexities of \nolder adults or those with multiple medical co-morbidities.\n• Patients should receive multidisciplinary and interprofessional care that seeks \nto prevent and/or manage morbidities associated with breast cancer or its \ntreatment.\n• Patients often experience multiple transitions between different care settings \nand healthcare providers. Coordination between primary care providers and \nspecialists is essential to ensure continuity of care. \n• Address all treatment options at each progression, including the option of \nsupportive care alone or hospice care, is appropriate in patients with stage IV \ndisease\n• Early involvement of a palliative care team should be considered to \nprovide advance care planning, goals of care discussions, care transitions, \npsychosocial support, and management of cancer and therapy-related \nsymptoms. \n• Routine screening, evaluation, and assessment for supportive care \ninterventions and referrals are necessary. Some of the symptoms are\n\u0017Hormone-related symptoms, see NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship .\n\u0017Cognitive dysfunction, see NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship.\n\u0017Peripheral neuropathy\n\u0017Cancer-related pain, see NCCN Guidelines for Adult Cancer Pain.\n\u0017Cancer-related fatigue, see NCCN Guidelines for Cancer-Related Fatigue.\n\u0017Cancer-related infections, NCCN Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of \nCancer-Related Infections.\n\u0017Chemotherapy-induced anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, see \nNCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors .\n\u0017Immunotherapy-related toxicities, see NCCN Guidelines for Management of \nImmunotherapy-Related Toxicities.PRINCIPLES OF SURVIVORSHIP FOR THOSE LIVING WITH ADVANCED OR METASTATIC BREAST CANCER\n\u0017Cardiac monitoring for patients treated with anthracyclines or HER2-\ntargeted therapy, see NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship.\n\u0017Nausea/vomiting, anorexia, cachexia, diarrhea, dyspnea, malignant \nwounds, sleep-wake disturbances, see NCCN Guidelines for \nAntiemesis and other NCCN Guidelines under Supportive Care . \nLifestyle, Wellness, and Psychosocial support: \n• Patients should be encouraged to maintain a physically active lifestyle \nand a healthy diet whenever possible, see NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship.\n• Consider age- and gender-appropriate cancer and preventive health \nscreenings. These decisions should be individualized according to the \npatients prognosis.\n• Screen for anxiety, fear of progression, depression, and post-traumatic \nstress disorder (PTSD) related to cancer and its treatment, see \nNCCN Guidelines for Distress Management and NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship.\n• Social determinants of health (SDOH) monitoring and referrals\n\u0017Provide resources and assistance through financial navigators, \nsocial workers, or other specified personnel to address financial \nconcerns, employment issues, and family support. Ensuring access \nto these services can alleviate significant stress for patients. \n ◊See NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care: Social Support/Resource \nManagement. \n ◊Financial Advocacy Services Guidelines (Association of Cancer \nCare Centers).\n ◊Financial Toxicity and Cancer Treatment (National Cancer \nInstitute).\n\u0017See NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management.\n• Facilitate connections with consumer groups, support networks, \nand organizations that advocate for accessible and equitable care. \nEngagement with these groups can empower patients and provide \nadditional support.\n• For any patients with sexual health concerns or for fertility and birth \ncontrol in premenopausal patients, see BINV-C.\nCommunication\n• Consistent and clear communication while acknowledging \nuncertainties of disease trajectory and prognosis is crucial. \n• Treatment goals, survivorship issues, and the specific roles of each \nprovider should be communicated to the patient.\nEngagement\n• See NCCN Resources for Patients and Caregivers  and Guidelines for \nPatients. \n• Address long-term survivorship issues specific to younger patients, \nsuch as psychosocial development and educational or vocational \nsupport. These patients may face unique challenges that require \ntargeted interventions.  \n• Living will/end-of-life planning should be discussed.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

Patients with these results are considered \neligible for endocrine therapies (applies to DCIS and invasive cancers). \n\u0017Invasive cancers with between 1%–10% ER positivity are considered \nER-low–positive. There are more limited data on the benefit of \nendocrine therapies in this group, but they suggest possible benefit \nfrom endocrine treatment, so patients are considered eligible for this \ntreatment (as above). However, this group is noted to be heterogeneous \nand the biologic behavior of ER-low–positive cancers may be more \nsimilar to ER-negative cancers. This should be considered in decision-\nmaking for other adjuvant therapy and overall treatment pathway. \n\u0017Cancers with <1% staining are considered ER-negative.

The status of \ncontrols should be reported for cases with these results.  \n• PR testing by IHC on invasive cancers can aid in the prognostic \nclassification of cancers and serve as a control for possible false-\nnegative ER results. Patients with ER-negative, PR-positive cancers may \nbe considered for endocrine therapies, but the data on this group are \nnoted to be limited. The same overall interpretation principles apply but \nPR should be interpreted as either positive (if 1%–100% of cells have \nnuclear staining) or negative (if <1% or 0% of cells have nuclear staining). \n• Interpretation of any ER result by pathology should include evaluation \nof the concordance with the histologic findings of each case. Clinicians \nshould be aware of when results are unusual and work with pathologists \nto attempt to resolve (eg, repeat testing, consultative review) or explain \natypical reported findings.

J Am Coll Radiol \n2023;20:902-914.PRINCIPLES OF DEDICATED BREAST MRI TESTING\nPersonnel, Facility, and Equipment\n• Breast MRI examinations are performed with IV contrast and should \nbe performed and interpreted by an expert breast imaging team \nworking in concert with the multidisciplinary treatment team. \n• Breast MRI examinations require a dedicated breast coil and breast \nimaging radiologists familiar with the optimal timing sequences and \nother technical details for image interpretation. The imaging center \nshould have the ability to perform MRI-guided needle sampling and/\nor image-guided localization of MRI-detected findings.Clinical Indications and Applications\n• May be used for staging evaluation to define extent of cancer or \npresence of multifocal or multicentric cancer in the ipsilateral \nbreast, or as screening of the contralateral breast cancer at time \nof initial diagnosis (category 2B). There are no high-level data to \ndemonstrate that the use of MRI to facilitate local therapy decision-\nmaking improves local recurrence or survival.1\n• May be helpful for breast cancer evaluation before and after \npreoperative systemic therapy to define extent of disease, response \nto treatment, and potential for breast-conservation therapy.\n• May be useful in identifying otherwise clinically occult disease \nin patients presenting with axillary nodal metastases (cT0, cN+), \nwith Paget disease, or with invasive lobular carcinoma poorly (or \ninadequately) defined on mammography, ultrasound, or physical \nexamination. \n• False-positive findings on breast MRI are common. Surgical \ndecisions should not be based solely on the MRI findings. Additional \ntissue sampling of areas of concern identified by breast MRI is \nrecommended.\n• The utility of MRI in follow-up screening of most patients with prior \nbreast cancer is undefined and annual MRI is recommended in \npatients with personal history of breast cancer who:2 \n   1) were diagnosed at age ≤50 or       \n   2) have dense breasts See NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis for indications for screening MRI in patients at increased breast cancer risk.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

Patients who may desire future \npregnancies should be referred to fertility specialists before \nchemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy to discuss the options \nbased on patient specifics, disease stage, and biology (which \ndetermine the urgency, type, and sequence of treatment). Timing \nand duration allowed for fertility preservation, options inclusive \nof oocyte and embryo cryopreservation as well as evolving \ntechnologies, and the probability of successful pregnancies \nsubsequent to completion of breast cancer therapy are also to be \ndiscussed.\n• Although amenorrhea frequently occurs during or after \nchemotherapy, it appears that the majority of patients <35 years \nresume menses within 2 years of finishing adjuvant chemotherapy.\n• Menses and fertility are not necessarily linked. Absence of regular \nmenses, particularly if the patient is taking tamoxifen, does not \nnecessarily imply infertility. Conversely, the presence of menses \ndoes not guarantee fertility. There are limited data regarding \ncontinued fertility after chemotherapy. \n• Patients should be advised not to become pregnant while on any \nsystemic therapy, and specific drug package inserts should be \nconsulted for recommendations. \n• A prospective trial (Partridge AH, Niman SM, Ruggeri M, et al. \nBreast 2021;59:327-338) evaluated premenopausal patients who \nhad completed between 18–30 months of endocrine therapy before \ntemporarily interrupting endocrine therapy for up to 2 years to \nallow for pregnancy. At short-term follow-up, the risk of recurrence \nwas not increased among those patients who enrolled or those \nwho became pregnant. This approach is an option for patients who \ndesire pregnancy, although long-term safety is still unknown.• Although data are limited, hormone-based birth control is \ndiscouraged regardless of the HR status of the patient's cancer.\n• Alternative methods of birth control include intrauterine devices \n(IUDs), barrier methods, or, for patients with no intent of future \npregnancies, tubal ligation or vasectomy for the partner.\n• Randomized trials have shown that ovarian suppression with \nGnRH agonist therapy administered during adjuvant chemotherapy \nin premenopausal patients with breast tumors (regardless of HR \nstatus) may preserve ovarian function and diminish the likelihood of \nchemotherapy-induced amenorrhea.\n• Smaller historical experiences in patients with ER-positive disease \nhave reported conflicting results with regard to the protective effect \nof GnRH agonist therapy on fertility.\n• Breastfeeding following breast-conservation cancer treatment is \nnot contraindicated. However, the quantity and quality of breast \nmilk produced by the conserved breast may not be sufficient or \nmay be lacking some of the nutrients needed. Breastfeeding is \nnot recommended during active treatment with chemotherapy and \nendocrine therapy or within 6 months of completing trastuzumab or \npertuzumab.The general considerations for fertility and sexual health/function outlined for specific populations in NCCN Guidelines for\nAdolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology and NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship are applicable to all patients diagnosed with \nbreast cancer.

Accurate orientation of the surgical specimens is required for optimal \nmargin evaluation.\n• Pathology report should include: \n\u0017Description of the gross and microscopic margin status.\n\u0017Reporting of the distance, orientation, and type of tumor (invasive or DCIS) in relation to the closest margin.\n\u0017Quantification of the extent of disease that is approximating the inked margin.\n• For mammographically detected DCIS with microcalcifications, complete resection should be documented by analysis of margins and \nspecimen radiography. Post-excision mammography can be considered if there is uncertainty. \n• The NCCN Panel accepts the definitions of negative margins after breast-conservation therapy from the 2014 SSO/ASTRO Margins \nGuideline1 for Stage I/II Invasive Cancers and the 2016 SSO/ASTRO/ASCO Guideline for DCIS.2 For patients with stage I or II invasive cancers \nafter BCS, a positive margin is defined as “ink on tumor” (any invasive cancer or DCIS cells on ink). These patients generally require further \nsurgery—either a re-excision to achieve a negative margin or a mastectomy. If re-excision is technically feasible to allow for BCS to achieve \n“no ink on tumor,” this can be done with resection of the involved margin guided by the orientation of the initial resection specimen or re-\nexcision of the entire original excision cavity. There may be select patients with stage III invasive cancers who may be eligible for BCS. For \nthese patients, the margins status would be accessed with similar definitions.\nDCIS\n• For patients with pure DCIS treated by BCS and whole breast RT, a quantitative description of any tumor close to margin resection width \nof at least 2 mm is associated with a reduced risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) relative to narrower negative margin widths, \nwhile the routine practice of obtaining margins  >2 mm to further improve outcomes is not supported by the evidence. When there is only \nminimal or focal DCIS involvement near the margin, clinical judgment should be utilized to weigh the risks of re-excision with risk of \nrecurrence for an individual patient.\n• For patients with DCIS treated with excision alone (no whole breast RT), regardless of margin width, there is a substantially higher rate of \nIBTR than treatment with excision and whole breast RT, even in predefined, patients who are low risk. Although the optimal margin width \nfor treatment with excision alone is unknown, it should be at least 2 mm, with some evidence suggesting improved IBTR rates with margin \nwidths wider than 2 mm.\n• DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-M), defined as an invasive focus ≤1 mm in size, should refer to the DCIS margin definition when considering \nthe optimal margin width (>2 mm), given that the majority of DCIS-M is comprised of DCIS and systemic therapy utilization for this lesion \nmore closely reflects the treatment pattern for DCIS than for invasive carcinoma. \nContinuedMARGIN STATUS RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER BREAST-CONSERVING SURGERY (BCS) FOR INVASIVE CANCERS AND DCIS\n1 Moran MS, Schnitt SJ, Giuliano AE, et al.

In this setting, “no ink on tumor” is recommended for either DCIS or invasive \ncancer cells, primarily because the natural history, treatment, and outcomes of these lesions are more similar to invasive cancer than DCIS. \nFor specifically challenging cases, clinical judgment and discussion with the patient should precede routine re-excision.\n• These margin recommendations cannot be applied directly to patients undergoing APBI/PBI,1 where data regarding local recurrence are \nmore limited. Furthermore, individualized clinical judgment should be utilized on a case-by-case basis, using postoperative mammography \nto identify residual calcifications and clinical-pathologic factors such as quantitative extent of disease near margin, presence of extensive \nintraductal component (EIC),3 young age, or multiple close margins to assist in identifying patients who may have an increased risk of IBTR \nand therefore may be selected to benefit from re-excision.\n• For patients with invasive breast cancer after BCS, with microscopically focally positive margins (in the absence of an EIC),3 the use of a \nhigher radiation boost dose to the tumor bed may be considered, since generally a boost to the tumor bed is recommended for patients at \nhigher risk of recurrence.

All patients undergoing breast \ncancer treatment should be educated about breast reconstructive options as adapted to their individual clinical situation. However , \nbreast reconstruction should not interfere with the appropriate surgical, medical, and radiation management of the cancer or the scope of \nappropriate surgical treatment for this disease. Coordinating consultation and surgical treatment with a reconstructive surgeon should be \nexecuted within a reasonable time frame. The process of breast reconstruction should not govern the timing or the scope of appropriate \nsurgical treatment for this disease. The availability of or the practicality of breast reconstruction should not result in the delay or refusal of \nappropriate surgical, medical, and radiation intervention. \n• Some patients may choose not to have reconstruction after mastectomy. The option to undergo mastectomy alone with a surgically \noptimized closure should be offered to all patients as part of a comprehensive discussion of reconstructive options. Achieving the optimal \nresult in this scenario may require additional procedures beyond the initial mastectomy. See BINV-H (6) for patient factors influencing choice \nof reconstruction.\n• Selection of reconstructive option and timing of reconstruction option is based on an assessment of cancer treatment, body habits of \npatients, obesity, smoking history, comorbidities, and patient concerns. Smoking and obesity (WHO Class 2 and 3) increase the risk of \nperioperative complications for all types of breast reconstruction. Patients with these high-risk factors should be counseled about their \nincreased risk for complications following breast reconstruction, including donor site complications/hernias and bulges of the abdominal \nwall, delayed healing, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, total flap failure (obesity), and implant failure (smoking). \n• Nipple areolar reconstruction should be offered to patients if the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) has been removed as part of their cancer \ntreatment. Various techniques are available for nipple reconstruction. Three-dimensional (3-D) tattooing can be offered to patients as an \noption for NAC reconstruction.\n• Additionally, patients who are not satisfied with the cosmetic outcome following completion of breast cancer treatment should be offered \nreconstructive surgery consultation.\n• Patients known to harbor genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer may opt to undergo bilateral prophylactic mastectomies \nwith reconstruction. Reconstruction can be performed with prosthetic, autologous tissue, or a combination of implant with autologous \ntissue. \n• Skin-sparing mastectomy should be performed by an experienced breast surgery team that works in a coordinated, multidisciplinary fashion \nto guide proper patient selection for skin-sparing mastectomy, determine optimal sequencing of the reconstructive procedure(s) in relation \nto adjuvant therapies, and perform a resection that achieves appropriate surgical margins.\n• Revisional surgery may be necessary after breast reconstruction. This may include procedures such as fat grafting, mastopexy, direct \nexcision/suction-assisted lipectomy, contralateral procedures (in cases of unilateral reconstruction), and others. Patients should be informed \nbefore reconstruction that revision surgery may be necessary.PRINCIPLES OF BREAST RECONSTRUCTION AFTER SURGERY\nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

Individual patients present preoperatively with \na variety of factors that may impact the choice of reconstruction, the risk of complications, donor site morbidity, and aesthetic result. Each \nof these factors must be taken into account, along with patient desire, to choose the optimal method of reconstruction. \n• Patient desire\n\u0017The patient may have a strong feeling towards one form of reconstruction after being given the options. Breast reconstruction should be a \nshared decision. \n• Medical comorbidities \n\u0017Medical comorbidities may preclude longer reconstructive procedures such as autologous tissue reconstruction in some patients.\n\u0017The selection of the reconstructive method of choice should take into consideration patient comorbidities.\n\u0017Poorly controlled diabetes is a risk factor for postoperative complications in both implant and autologous tissue reconstruction.\n\u0017Patients should be screened for personal or familial thrombophilia. Thrombophilia may result in reconstructive failure of microsurgical \nreconstruction or thromboembolic events.\n• Tobacco use\n\u0017Smoking has been associated with increased risk of delayed wound healing, mastectomy flap necrosis, NAC necrosis in the setting of \nnipple-sparing mastectomy, infection, and failure of implant-based reconstruction. In free flap reconstruction, smoking increases the risk \nof donor complications. Patients should be encouraged to stop smoking prior to reconstruction.\n\u0017Smoking has not definitively been shown to increase the risk of microvascular thrombosis in free flap breast reconstruction. \n• Breast size/shape\n\u0017If patient has significant macromastia or ptosis, consideration can be given to a reduction pattern mastectomy with either implant-based or \nautologous tissue reconstruction, or oncoplastic reduction techniques. \n\u0017The volume limitations of implants may preclude an acceptable reconstruction in patients with macromastia if preservation of volume is a \npriority.\n• BMI\n\u0017Patients with a markedly elevated BMI may be at increased risk of infectious complications and seromas as well as donor site \ncomplications from autologous reconstruction, including delayed healing and hernia formation. Immediate reconstruction can be \nperformed, but delayed reconstruction can be considered if the patient is motivated to lose weight. Oncoplastic reduction techniques can \nbe considered if the breast is large/ptotic.\n• Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) and other rare implant-associated malignancies\n\u0017BIA-ALCL commonly presents with delayed periprosthetic effusion and breast asymmetry occurring  >1 year after implantation.  \n\u0017Rarely, BIA-ALCL can present with a mass, regional lymphadenopathy, overlying skin rash, and/or capsular contracture.  \n\u0017Similar symptoms can also be seen in breast implant associated squamous cell carcinoma (BIA-SCC), another rare implant associated \nmalignancy. Individuals with breast implants have a very small risk of developing BIA-ALCL (average 7–9 years after implantation) and BIA-\nSCC (average 22 years after implantation). \n\u0017The majority of cases of BIA-ALCL have been seen in textured implants, while BIA-SCC is associated with either smooth or textured \nimplants. Rare cases of implant associated diffuse large B-cell lymphomas have also been reported. See NCCN Guidelines for T-Cell \nLymphomas.PRINCIPLES OF BREAST RECONSTRUCTION AFTER SURGERY\nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

In patients with large or significantly ptotic \nbreasts, NAC-sparing mastectomies may be offered in select cases by using various reduction patterns or delay techniques to augment \nthe NAC perfusion, either in an immediate or delayed fashion, as long as it does not delay oncologic care. Intraoperative assessment of the \nNAC perfusion should also guide the decision to preserve the NAC or remove it. \n\u0017Patients should be counseled on the risk of delayed healing, nipple necrosis, loss of pigmentation, loss of sensation, loss of projection, \nand need for subsequent removal of the NAC.\n\u0017Topical 2% nitroglycerine (45 mg total dose) used prophylactically has been shown to reduce mastectomy skin flap necrosis in both skin-\nsparing mastectomy and nipple sparing mastectomy in one randomized control trial. \n• Inflammatory breast cancer\n\u0017Delayed reconstruction after mastectomy for IBC remains the clinical standard for several reasons. The need to resect involved skin \nnegates the benefit of skin-sparing mastectomy for immediate reconstruction, and high rates of local and distant recurrence warrant \ncomprehensive RNI in a timely fashion, which may be technically more challenging or subject to delay after immediate reconstruction.\n\u0017Advances in multimodal therapy have improved 5-year survival in patients with IBC, justifying clinical studies to see if immediate \nreconstruction may be appropriate for certain patients with IBC, but neither the outcomes nor the clinical features to predict such \noutcomes are known at this time.\n\u0017In the uncommon clinical circumstance that the extent of skin excision at the time of mastectomy precludes primary or local closure, \nreconstruction of the chest wall defect with autologous tissue is necessary, and concomitant immediate reconstruction may be \naccomplished.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

More frequent imaging may be needed for selected cases with \ninconsistent reproducibility. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) may be utilized with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique to \nreduce normal tissue exposure of the heart, lung or liver. \n\u0017Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) should be used to evaluate dose, normal tissue constraints (ie, heart, lung), and planning target volumes \n(PTVs). \n• It is common for RT to follow chemotherapy when chemotherapy is indicated. See BINV-I 2 of 3 .\n• In the setting of oligometastatic breast cancer, the currently available data do not support ablative metastasis-directed RT (ie, SBRT) for \nextending overall survival OS or PFS. In some cases, SBRT may be preferred over palliative radiotherapy to provide more durable local \ncontrol and pain relief.\nWhole Breast RT\n• Target definition is the breast tissue at risk. \n• RT dosing:\n\u0017The whole breast should receive a hypofractionated dose of 40–42.5 Gy in 15–16 fractions; in selected cases 45–50.4 Gy in 25–28 fractions \nmay be considered. \n\u0017A boost to the tumor bed is recommended in patients at higher risk for recurrence. The boost can be given sequentially after whole \nbreast RT or as a simultaneous integrated boost. Typical boost doses when given sequentially are 10–16 Gy in 4–8 fractions. When given \nconcurrently, the whole breast should receive 40 Gy in 15 fractions and the lumpectomy site should receive 48 Gy in 15 fractions.a,b \n\u0017Ultra-hypofractionated whole breast RT of 28.5 Gy in 5 (once-a-week) fractions may be considered for selected patients over 50 years \nfollowing BCS with early-stage, node-negative disease, particularly those in whom a boost is not intended.c,d\n• Lumpectomy cavity boost can be delivered using enface electrons, photons, or brachytherapy. \nBINV-I\n1 OF 3PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY \na Vicini FA, Winter K, Freedman GM, et al.

See below.\n• In the case of cT3N0, high-risk features for considering PMRT include, but are not limited to, young age and/or LVI. \n• Based on anatomic considerations and presence of reconstruction, various 3-D-, intensity modulated radiation therapy [IMRT], or volumetric modulated arc \ntherapy (VMAT) techniques using photons and/or electrons are appropriate.\n• PMRT details and dosing:\n\u0017The routine use of bolus is not recommended. Bolus should be used for inflammatory breast cancer and considered in clinically relevant situations \nwhere the dose to the skin may not be adequate.\n\u0017Chest wall RT dose may be delivered in conventional dosing of 45–50.4 Gy in 25–28 fractions or moderately hypofractionated dosing of 40–42.5 Gy in \n15–16 fractions.\n\u0017In patients who are at high risk for local recurrence, a chest wall scar boost may be considered of approximately 10 Gy delivered in 4-5 fractions with or \nwithout bolus.\nRegional Noda l Radiation\n• For supra/infra-clavicular and axillary nodes, prescription depth varies based on the patient anatomy. \n• Regional nodes should be contoured when when RNI is indicated. Refer to breast atlases for contouring guidelines.e,f\n• RT dosing:\n\u0017RT doses to the regional nodes of 46–50 Gy (conventional fractionation) or 39–42 Gy (moderately fractionated) dosing schedules similar to PMRT and \nwhole breast may be considered. \n\u0017A supplemental boost of RT can be delivered to grossly involved or enlarged lymph nodes (ie, internal mammary, supra/infra-clavicular) that have not \nbeen surgically removed.\nRT with Preoperative or Adjuvant Systemic Therapy\n• In patients treated with preoperative systemic therapy, adjuvant RT is based on the maximal disease stage (ie, clinical stage, pathologic stage, tumor \ncharacteristics) at diagnosis (before preoperative systemic therapy) and pathology results after preoperative systemic therapy.\n• Sequencing of RT with systemic therapy:\n\u0017It is common for RT to follow chemotherapy when chemotherapy is indicated. However, \n –CMF (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil) is the only standard regimen that can be given concurrently with RT .  \n –Capecitabine is typically given after completion of RT.\n –Olaparib should be given after completion of RT. \n\u0017Available data suggest that sequential or concurrent endocrine therapy with RT is acceptable. Due to compounding side effects, initiating endocrine \ntherapy at the completion of RT may be preferred. \n ◊ Abemaciclib or ribociclib should be initiated after completion of surgery/RT/chemotherapy, concurrently with endocrine therapy.\n\u0017Adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy ± endocrine therapy may be delivered concurrently with RT.\ne Offersen BV, Boersma LJ, Kirkove C, et al.

On this page, the terms males and females refer to sex assigned at birth.\n• Few males have been included in breast cancer trials.1 Therefore, recommendations regarding management of breast cancer in males are \ngenerally extrapolated from findings of clinical trials focusing on breast cancer in females.\n• Although there are some biologic and clinical differences between breast cancer in males and females, management of breast cancer in \nmales is similar overall to management of breast cancer in females, with the following special considerations pertinent to male patients2:\n\u0017Genetics: The NCCN Panel recommends consideration of genetic testing for all males with breast cancer (See NCCN Guidelines for \nGenetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate ).\n\u0017Breast surgery: Historically, males with breast cancer have undergone mastectomy more often than BCS. However, breast-conservation \ntherapy is increasingly being performed in males and evolving data indicate that breast conservation in males is associated with \nequivalent outcomes to mastectomy and that it is safe and feasible. Decisions about breast conservation versus mastectomy in males \nshould be made according to similar criteria as for females.2-9\n\u0017Axillary lymph node surgery: As in females, SLNB should be performed in the setting of male breast cancer with a clinically node-negative \naxilla.2,4\n\u0017RT: Indications for radiation after breast surgery in males with breast cancer are the same as for females with breast cancer.2,5,10,11\n\u0017Use of molecular assays: Data are limited regarding the use of molecular assays to assess prognosis and to predict benefit from \nchemotherapy in males with breast cancer.2 Available data suggest the 21-gene assay recurrence score provides prognostic information \nin males with breast cancer.12,13\n\u0017Preoperative/adjuvant systemic therapy: Chemotherapy with/without HER2-targeted therapy should be recommended for males with \nbreast cancer according to guidelines for females with breast cancer.2 Options for adjuvant endocrine therapy for males with breast \ncancer include tamoxifen for 5–10 years or, if tamoxifen is contraindicated, a GnRH analog plus an aromatase inhibitor. In males, single-\nagent adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor has been associated with inferior outcomes compared to tamoxifen alone, likely due \nto inadequate estradiol suppression, and is not recommended.2,14-17\n\u0017Follow-up after treatment for early-stage disease: There are only limited data to support screening for breast cancer in males.2 The NCCN \nPanel recommends that bone density be assessed at baseline and every 2 years in males with breast cancer who receive adjuvant GnRH \nanalog therapy. Low bone density should be managed according to standard guidelines.18 \n\u0017Systemic therapy for advanced disease: Management of advanced breast cancer in males is similar to that in females; however, it is \npreferred that when an aromatase inhibitor is used, a GnRH analog should be given concurrently.2 Available data suggest single-agent \nfulvestrant has similar efficacy in males as in females.19 CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant, \nmTOR inhibitors, and PIK3CA inhibitors have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials in males with breast cancer. However, \navailable real-world data suggest comparable efficacy and safety profiles and it is reasonable to recommend these agents to males \nbased on extrapolation of data from studies comprised largely of female participants with advanced breast cancer. Indications for and \nrecommendations regarding chemotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and PARP inhibitors for advanced breast cancer in \nmales are similar to those for advanced breast cancer in females.1\nReferences on BINV-J 2 of 2PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

See \nPrinciples of Biomarker Testing (BINV-A).\n\u0017ER+ tumors: ER testing should be used to determine if a patient is a candidate \nfor endocrine therapies.a Patients with cancers with 1%–100% ER IHC staining \nare considered ER+ and eligible for endocrine therapies, there are limited \nefficacy data on the subgroup of cancers with ER-low-positive (1%–10%) results. \nThe ER-low-positive group is heterogeneous with reported biologic behavior \noften similar to ER-negative cancers; thus, individualized consideration of risks \nversus benefits of endocrine therapy and additional adjuvant therapies should \nbe incorporated into decision-making. \n\u0017PR+ tumors: Patients with ER-negative, PR+ cancers may be considered for \nendocrine therapies, but the data on this group are noted to be limited. The same \noverall interpretation principles apply but PR should be interpreted as either \npositive (if 1%–100% of cells have nuclear staining) or negative (if <1% or 0% of \ncells have nuclear staining).\n• The majority of hormone sensitive tumors are ER+/PR+ or ER+/PR-negative. \nConsidering  that ER -negative/PR+ tumors are relatively uncommon, in these \nguidelines, ER and/or PR+ tumors are referred to as HR+. \n• The magnitude of risk reduction from adjuvant endocrine therapy is dependent on: \n\u0017Level of ER expression: Low ER+ expression is less likely to benefit from \nendocrine therapy. \n\u0017Recurrence score (RS) on gene expression assay test results: Patients with high \nRS will gain relatively less benefit from adjuvant endocrine alone compared to \nthose with low RS.\nCandidates for Ovarian Suppression + Endocrine Therapy\n•  Premenopausal patients\n• Endocrine sensitive tumors with high enough recurrence risk where the additional \nabsolute decrease in recurrence compared with tamoxifen alone is worth the \nadditional toxicity (young age, high-grade tumor, lymph node involvement).b  \nBINV-K\n1 OF 3PRINCIPLES OF ADJUVANT ENDOCRINE THERAPY\n(for pT1-3,pN+,M0)\na Definition of Menopause (BINV-O).\nb A balanced discussion of the risks and benefits associated with ovarian suppression therapy is critical, including the potential side effects of premature menopause. \nAromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen for 5 years plus ovarian suppression should be considered, based on SOFT and TEXT clinical trial outcomes, for premenopausal \npatients at higher risk of recurrence (ie, young age, high-grade tumor, lymph node involvement).\nc Baek SY, Noh WC, Ahn SH, et al.

Frequency of testing of estradiol and FSH/LH levels \nshould be individualized. \n• AI can stimulate ovarian function. If vaginal bleeding occurs while \non AI, contact physician immediately.\nMethods for OFS\n• GNRH agonists\n\u0017Goserelin 3.6 mg SC every 4 weeks or 10.8 mg SC every 12 weeks\n\u0017Leuprolide 3.75–7.5 mg IM or SC every 4 weeks or 11.25–22.5 mg IM \nor SC every 12 weeks\n\u0017Triptorelin: 3.75 mg IM every 4 weeks.\n• Radiation therapy\n• Bilateral oophorectomy\nInitiation of OFS\n• Prior to or with start of chemotherapy (preoperative or adjuvant)\n• If no chemotherapy planned, then OFS should be started alone for \nat least 1–2 cycles or concurrently with tamoxifen until estradiol \nlevel in postmenopausal range at which time an aromatase inhibitor \ncould considered.\n\u0017Concurrently with RT or upon completion \nDuration of OFS \n• 5 years of OFS is optimal based on SOFT and TEXT trials. The \n8-year DFS was 85.4% with OFS + tamoxifen versus 80.2% with \ntamoxifen alone. A minimum 2 years of OFS is encouraged.  There \nare no data on efficacy or safety to support prolonging of OFS > 5 \nyears.c\n• Premenopausal patients wishing to continue adjuvant endocrine \ntherapy after OFS stopped should use tamoxifen.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

The correlation between pathologic response and long-\nterm outcome is strongest for TNBC, somewhat less so for HER2-positive disease, and least for ER-positive disease.c,d \n• A number of chemotherapy regimens have activity in the preoperative setting. In general, those chemotherapy regimens recommended in \nthe adjuvant setting may be considered in the preoperative setting. See Preoperative/Adjuvant Therapy Regimens (BINV-M). \n• Preoperative endocrine therapy alone may be considered for patients with ER-positive disease based on comorbidities or low-risk luminal \nbiology based on clinical characteristics and/or genomic signatures (until desired effect is achieved). Data shows that optimal duration for \nresponse if achieved between 4–6 months.e \n• Patients with HER-2 positive, ≥cT2 and/or cN+ should be considered for HER2-directed therapy preoperatively . See Preoperative/Adjuvant \nTherapy Regimens (BINV-M).  \n• Some studies suggest an increased risk of locoregional recurrence following use of preoperative chemotherapy.f These trials delivered \nchemotherapy regimens that are no longer standard, did not include targeted therapies, did not use modern imaging techniques, and/or \nused non-standard locoregional management. Care should be taken to follow the procedures outlined in BINV-12 and BINV-14 to assure \nappropriate locoregional management. Not all patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative systemic therapy. Accurate clinical \nstaging at baseline prior to initiation of preoperative systemic therapy is critical. See Potentially Operable Disease: Breast and Axillary \nEvaluation Prior to Preoperative Systemic Therapy (BINV-12).\n• Tumor response should be routinely assessed by clinical exam and imaging studies (see footnote uu on BINV-13) during delivery of \npreoperative therapy. It is preferred that the standard regimen is completed prior to surgery. If all intended treatment is not completed prior \nto surgery, the remainder may be given in the adjuvant setting. Patients with operable breast cancer experiencing progression of disease \nduring preoperative systemic therapy may be given an alternate systemic regimen or proceed to surgery if deemed resectable. Locoregional \ntherapy principles should be applied in the same manner as in patients treated with adjuvant systemic therapy. \na Yau C, Osdoit M, van der Noorda M, et al.

ECOG-ACRIN \nEAZ171: prospective validation trial of germline predictors of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy in Black women with early-stage breast \ncancer. J Clin Oncol 2024;42:2899-2907). \n• Consider cryotherapy of hands and feet to decrease the risk of peripheral neuropathy when receiving taxane therapies.\n• Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia for patients receiving neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy . \nResults may be less effective with anthracycline-containing regimens.\n• Alternative taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel) may be substituted for select patients due to medical necessity (ie, \nhypersensitivity reaction). If substituted for weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, then the weekly dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel should not \nexceed 125 mg/m2.\n• Sequence of therapies in the adjuvant setting: \n\u0017Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy should be given sequentially, with endocrine therapy given after chemotherapy.\n\u0017Adjuvant olaparib can be given concurrently with endocrine therapy. \n\u0017For sequencing of RT with systemic therapy, see BINV-I (2).\nFor those receiving HER2-targeted therapy: \n\u0017Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk subcutaneous injection may be substituted for trastuzumab IV; however, dosing and administration \ninstruction differ. Do not substitute trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine.\n\u0017Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab; \nhowever, the dosing and administration instruction may differ.

Natural menopause is experienced between ages 42–58 \nyears.\n• Breast cancer treatments may affect ovarian function and menses. \n\u0017In those who are premenopausal at the beginning of chemotherapy and who develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, ovarian function \nmay still be intact despite amenorrhea or may resume over time. The likelihood of ovarian function resuming after chemotherapy is higher \namong those aged <40 years.\n\u0017Tamoxifen may cause amenorrhea without inducing menopause in premenopausal individuals.\n\u0017Ovarian function suppression induces amenorrhea and reduces ovarian estrogen synthesis without causing permanent menopause.\n• Twelve months of amenorrhea alone is insufficient to diagnose menopause with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or with tamoxifen \n± ovarian suppression. FSH and estradiol levels are used to support the diagnosis of menopause; however, clear criteria to guide \ninterpretation of FSH and estradiol in this population is lacking. \n\u0017Tamoxifen may alter FSH levels, limiting its utility in determination of menopausal status.\n\u0017FSH and estradiol should be repeated serially to ensure menopausal status in patients with breast cancer with chemotherapy-induced \namenorrhea.\n• Evidence-based criteria for the diagnosis of menopause in patients with breast cancer are lacking. Clinical trials in breast cancer have \nutilized a variety of definitions of menopause. Reasonable criteria for determining menopause in patients with breast cancer include any of \nthe following:\n\u0017Prior bilateral oophorectomy\n\u0017Age ≥60 years\n\u0017Age <60 with amenorrhea for ≥12 months in the absence of prior chemotherapy , receipt of tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression \nand estradiol and FSH in the postmenopausal range\n\u0017Age <60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for ≥12 months with FSH and estradiol in post-menopausal range on serial \nassessments\n\u0017Age <60 years: on tamoxifen with FSH and estradiol level in postmenopausal range\n• Menopausal status cannot be determined in those receiving ovarian function suppressionPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

See NCCN Guidelines for Management of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities . \n• Regular cardiac monitoring for patients with current or prior use of anthracyclines or HER2-targeted therapy. See NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship: Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment.\n• Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of chemotherapy-induced alopecia for patients receiving chemotherapy. Results may be less \neffective with anthracycline.\n• When receiving taxane-containing regimen: \n\u0017Alternative taxanes (ie, docetaxel, paclitaxel, albumin-bound paclitaxel) may be substituted for select patients due to medical necessity (ie, \nhypersensitivity reaction). If substituted for weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, then the weekly dose of albumin-bound paclitaxel should not \nexceed 125 mg/m2.\n\u0017Consider cryotherapy of hands and feet to decrease the risk of peripheral neuropathy.1,2\nFor Those Receiving HER2-targeted Therapy\n• Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk subcutaneous injection may be substituted for trastuzumab IV; however, dosing and administration \ninstruction differ. Do not substitute trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk for or with ado-trastuzumab emtansine or fam-trastuzumab \nderuxtecan-nxki.\n• Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase-zzxf subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab; however , \nthe dosing and administration instruction may differ. \n• Patients previously treated with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab in the absence of pertuzumab in the metastatic setting may be considered \nfor one line of therapy including both trastuzumab plus pertuzumab in combination with or without cytotoxic therapy (such as vinorelbine or \ntaxane). Further research is needed to determine the ideal sequencing strategy for anti-HER2 therapy.\n1 Sphar BG, Bowe C, Dains JE.

Clinical experience suggests frequent clinical benefit for such treatment. However , there are no meaningful data for use of any of these regimens among patients previously treated with pertuzumab-based chemotherapy, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, or trastuzumab/capecitabine/tucatinib regimens. Thus, the optimal sequence or true benefit of therapy is not known. r Trastuzumab given in combination with an anthracycline is associated with significant cardiac toxicity.

Modifications of drug dose \nand schedule and initiation of supportive care interventions are often necessary because of expected toxicities and individual patient variability , prior \ntreatment, and comorbidity. The optimal delivery of anti-cancer agents therefore requires a health care delivery team experienced in the use of anti-\ncancer agents and the management of associated toxicities in patients with cancer.See dosing for targeted therapies on \nBINV-Q (14)\nReferences on \nBINV-Q 12 of 15PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

An isolated \nincrease in tumor markers should rarely be used to declare progression of disease. Changes in bone lesions are often difficult to assess on plain or cross-sectional \nradiology or on bone scan. For these reasons, patient symptoms and serum tumor markers may be more helpful in patients with bone-dominant metastatic disease. PRINCIPLES OF MONITORING METASTATIC DISEASE\nMonitoring of patient symptoms and cancer burden during treatment of metastatic breast cancer is important to determine whether the \ntreatment is providing benefit and that the patient does not have toxicity from an ineffective therapy .\nComponents of Monitoring\nMonitoring includes periodic assessment of varied combinations of symptoms, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, imaging \nstudies, and blood biomarkers where appropriate. Results of monitoring are classified as response/continued response to treatment, stable \ndisease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease. The clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different \nforms of information to make a determination regarding whether disease is being controlled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable. \nSometimes, this information may be contradictory. Clinicians should take into account patient preferences through a shared decision-making \nprocess.\nDefinition of Disease Progression\nUnequivocal evidence of progression of disease by one or more of these factors is required to establish progression of disease, either \nbecause of ineffective therapy or acquired resistance of disease to an applied therapy . Progression of disease may be identified through \nevidence of growth or worsening of disease at previously known sites of disease and/or of the occurrence of new sites of metastatic disease.\n• Findings concerning for progression of disease include:\n\u0017Worsening symptoms such as pain or dyspnea\n\u0017Evidence of worsening or new disease on physical examination\n\u0017Declining performance status\n\u0017Unexplained weight loss \n\u0017Increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), or bilirubin \n\u0017Hypercalcemia \n\u0017New radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality\n\u0017New areas of abnormality on functional imaging (eg, bone scan, PET/CT)\n\u0017Increasing tumor markers (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], CA 15-3, CA 27.29)a\nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

Generally, the same method of assessment should be used over time (eg, an abnormality found on chest CT should generally be \nmonitored with repeat chest CT). \n• Some non-clinically important variation in measurement of abnormalities by all serial studies is common and expected. Therefore, the use \nof objective and widely accepted criteria for response, stability, and progression of disease are encouraged. Such systems include the \nResponse Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, et al. New response evaluation \ncriteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline [version 1.1]. Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228-247) and the WHO criteria (Miller AB, Hoogstraten \nB, Staquet M, Winkler A. Reporting results of cancer treatment. Cancer 1981;47:207-214).\n• Studies of functional imaging, such as radionuclide bone scans and PET imaging, are particularly challenging when used to assess \nresponse. In the case of bone scans, responding disease may result in a flare or increased activity on the scan that may be misinterpreted \nas disease progression, especially on the first follow-up bone scan after initiating a new therapy . PET imaging is challenging because of the \nabsence of a reproducible, validated, and widely accepted set of standards for disease activity assessment.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

However, the selection and timing of chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and RT \nis different if pregnant. BCS during the first trimester of pregnancy can be considered in \nthose who will require adjuvant chemotherapy and can have adjuvant radiation therapy \ndelayed until after delivery. Chemotherapy should not be administered during the first \ntrimester of pregnancy, and RT should not be administered during any trimester of \npregnancy. Coordination is recommended between the oncology and obstetrics teams \nto plan the optimal timing of systemic therapy administration during pregnancy. Most \nexperience with chemotherapy during pregnancy for breast cancer is from regimens \nthat utilize various combinations of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and fluorouracil. \nConsiderations for postpartum chemotherapy are the same as for non–pregnancy-\nassociated breast cancer. \nc Use of blue dye is contraindicated in pregnancy; radiolabeled sulfur colloid appears to be \nsafe for SLNB in pregnancy.

The \noptimal schedule is unclear. If used, the NCCN Panel recommends \nweekly administration of paclitaxel after the first trimester if clinically \nindicated by disease status. The use of anti-HER2 therapy is \ncontraindicated during pregnancy. \ne Survival outcomes of BCT are equivalent to mastectomy in both \nnon-pregnancy and pregnancy-associated BCs. Therapeutic RT \nis generally avoided during pregnancy due to potential risks to \nthe fetus. Mastectomy may be preferred, particularly for early (1st \ntrimester) gestational diagnosis, as early BCS may preclude timely \nadministration of RT. Generally, intervals of 12–16 weeks between \ntreatment modalities (surgery, RT, and chemotherapy) are considered \nacceptable. \nf If late first trimester, may consider preoperative chemotherapy in the \nsecond trimester.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

The \nT category is based primarily on the size of the invasive component of the cancer. The maximum size of a tumor focus is used as an estimate of disease volume. The \nlargest contiguous dimension of a tumor focus is used, and small satellite foci of noncontiguous tumor are not added to the size. The cellular fibrous reaction to invasive \ntumor cells is generally included in the measurement of a tumor prior to treatment; however , the dense fibrosis observed following neoadjuvant treatment is generally \nnot included in the pathological measurement because its extent may overestimate the residual tumor volume. The clinical size of a primary tumor (T) can be measured \nbased on clinical findings (physical examination and imaging modalities, such as mammography , ultrasound, and MR imaging) and pathological findings (gross and \nmicroscopic measurements). Clinical tumor size (cT) should be based on the clinical findings that are judged to be most accurate for a particular case, although it may \nstill be somewhat inaccurate because the intent of some breast cancers is not always apparent with current imaging techniques and because tumors are composed of \nvarying proportions of noninvasive and invasive disease, which these techniques are currently unable to distinguish. Size should be measured to the nearest millimeter . \nIf the tumor size is slightly less than or greater than a cutoff for a given T classification the size should be rounded to the millimeter reading that is closest to the cutoff. \nFor example, a reported size of 4.9 mm is reported as 5 mm, or a size of 2.04 cm is reported as 2.0 cm (20 mm). The exception to this rounding rule is for a breast \ntumor sized between 1.0 and 1.4 mm. These sizes are rounded up to 2 mm, because rounding down would result in the cancer’s being categorized as microinvasive \ncarcinoma (T1mi) defined as a size of 1.0 mm or less. \nTable 1.

AJCC Anatomic Stage Groups (continued)\nHistologic Grade (G)\nAll invasive breast carcinomas should be assigned a histologic grade. The \nNottingham combined histologic grade (Nottingham modification of the SBR \ngrading system) is recommended and is stipulated for use by the College of \nAmerican Pathologists (see www.cap.org). The grade for a tumor is determined \nby assessing morphologic features (tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and \ncalibrated mitotic count), assigning a value from 1 (favorable) to 3 (unfavorable) \nfor each feature, and totaling the scores for all three categories. A combined score \nof 3–5 points is designated as grade 1; a combined score of 6–7 points is grade 2; \na combined score of 8–9 points is grade 3.

For cases with lymph node involvement with no evidence of primary tumor (e.g. \nT0 N1, etc.) or with breast ductal carcinoma in situ (e.g. Tis N1, etc.), the grade, \nHER2, ER, and PR information from the tumor in the lymph node should be used \nfor assigning stage group.\n3. For cases where HER2 is determined to be “equivocal” by ISH (FISH or CISH) \ntesting under the 2013 ASCO/CAP HER2 testing guidelines, the HER2 “negative” \ncategory should be used for staging in the Clinical Prognostic Stage Group.\n4.

For cases with lymph node involvement with no evidence of primary tumor (e.g. \nT0 N1, etc.) or with breast ductal carcinoma  in situ (e.g. Tis N1, etc.), the grade, \nHER2, ER and PR information from the tumor in the lymph node should be used \nfor assigning stage group.\n2. For cases where HER2 is determined to be “equivocal” by ISH (FISH or CISH) \ntesting under the 2013 ASCO/CAP HER2 testing guidelines, HER2 “negative” \ncategory should be used for staging in the Pathological Prognostic Stage Group.\n3. The prognostic value of these Prognostic Stage Groups is based on populations \nof persons with breast cancer that have been offered and mostly treated with \nappropriate endocrine and/or systemic chemotherapy (including anti-HER2 \ntherapy).\nTable 5. Genomic Profile for Pathologic Prognostic Staging\nWhen Oncotype DX Score is Less than 11...\nTNM Grade HER2 ER PR Stage\nT1 N0 M0\nT2 N0 M0Any Negative Positive Any IA\nNotes:\n1. Obtaining genomic profiles is NOT required for assigning Pathological \nPrognostic Stage. However genomic profiles may be performed for use in \ndetermining appropriate treatment. If the OncotypeDx® test is performed in cases \nwith a T1N0M0 or T2N0M0 cancer that is HER2-negative and ER-positive, and \nthe recurrence score is less than 11, the case should be assigned Pathological \nPrognostic Stage Group IA.\n2. If OncotypeDx® is not performed, or if it is performed and the OncotypeDx® \nscore is not available, or is 11 or greater for patients with T1–2 N0 M0 HER2–\nnegative, ER-positive cancer, then the Prognostic Stage Group is assigned based \non the anatomic and biomarker categories shown above.\n3. OncotypeDx® is the only multigene panel included to classify Pathologic \nPrognostic Stage because prospective Level I data supports this use for patients \nwith a score less than 11. Future updates to the staging system may include \nresults from other multigene panels to assign cohorts of patients to Prognostic \nStage Groups based on the then available evidence. Inclusion or exclusion in this \nstaging table of a genomic profile assay is not an endorsement of any specific \nassay and should not limit appropriate clinical use of any genomic profile assay \nbased on evidence available at the time of treatment.\nST-11PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-2 \nOverview \nBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in females in the United \nStates and is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death. The \nAmerican Cancer Society has estimated that 313,510 Americans will be \ndiagnosed with breast cancer and 42,780 will die of disease in the United \nStates in 2024.1,2 The therapeutic  options  for patients  with noninvasive or \ninvasive breast cancer are complex and varied. The NCCN  Clinical \nPractice  Guidelines  in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Breast Cancer \ninclude guidelines  for clinical management of patients  with carcinoma in  \nsitu, invasive breast cancer, Paget disease, Phyllodes tumor, inflammatory \nbreast cancer (IBC), male breast cancer, and breast cancer during \npregnancy. These Guidelines have been developed and are updated \ncontinuously by  a multidisciplinary panel  of representatives  from NCCN \nMember  Institutions with  breast  cancer -focused  expertise  in the fields  of \nmedical  oncology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, \nreconstructive surgery, and patient advocacy.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and \ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. \nNCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing \non organ -specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations  to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nLiterature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update \nMethodology  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines® for Breast \nCancer , an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to \nobtain key literature using the following search terms : Breast Cancer , \nBreast Neoplasms, DCIS , Inflammatory Breast Cancer , OR Phyllodes . \nThe PubMed database was chosen as it remains the most widely used \nresource for medical literature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical \nliterature.3  \n \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Guideline; Randomized \nControlled Trial; Meta- Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation \nStudies.  \n \nThe potential relevance of the PubMed search  was examined. The data \nfrom key PubMed articles selected by the P anel for review during the \nGuidelines update meeting as well as articles from additional sources \ndeemed as relevant to these Guidelines and discussed by the P anel have \nbeen included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high- level evidence is lacking are based on the P anel’s review of \nlower -level evidence and expert opinion.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-3 \nDuctal Carcinoma in Situ (Tis, N0, M0)   \nThe diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) has increased since the \nintroduction and increased utilization of screening mammography. \nAccording to the American Cancer Society, over 50,000 cases of DCIS of \nthe female breast will be diagnosed in the United States in 2022.1  \nWorkup for DCIS  \nThe recommended workup and staging of DCIS includes  history and \nphysical exam ination , bilateral diagnostic mammography , pathology \nreview , determination of tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status , and MRI, as \nindicated.  \n \nFor pathology reporting , the NCCN P anel endorses the College of \nAmerican Pathologists  (CAP) Protocol for both  invasive and noninvasive \ncarcinomas of the breast.4  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends testing for ER status in order to determine \nthe benefit of adjuvant endocrine therapy or risk reduction. This is in \naccordance with the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/CAP \nguidelines,5 which recommend that ER testing of newly diagnosed DCIS to \ndetermine potential benefit of endocrine therapies for breast cancer risk \nreduction and progesterone receptor (PR) testing be considered optional. \nAlthough the tumor HER2  status  is of prognostic significance in invasive \ncancer , its importance in DCIS has not been  established.  To date, studies \nhave either found unclear or weak evidence of HER2 status as a \nprognostic indicator in DCIS ,6-9 and no statistically significant benefit to the \nuse of trastuzumab concurrently with radiation in HER2- amplified DCIS.10 \nThe NCCN P anel has concluded that HER2 status for DCIS does not alter \nthe management  strategy and therefore is not recommended for DCIS.  \nGenetic counseling is recommended if the patient is considered to be at high risk for hereditary breast cancer as defined by  the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and \nPancreatic .  \nThe role of MRI in management of DCIS remains unclear. MRI has been \nprospectively shown to have a sensitivity of up to 98% for high- grade \nDCIS.11 In a p rospective, obs ervational study of 193 patients  with pure \nDCIS who under went  both mammography and MRI imaging \npreoperatively ; 93 (56%) patients  were diagnosed by mammography and \n153 (92%) were diagnosed by MRI ( P < .0001). Of the 89 patients with \nhigh- grade DCIS, 43  (48%) who were  not diagnosed by mammography  \nwere  diagnosed by MRI alone.11 However, other studies suggest that MRI \ncan overestimate the extent of disease.12 Therefore, the surgical decisions \nfor performing a mastectomy for DCIS should not be solely based on MRI findings alone.  If MRI findings suggest more extensive disease than is \nseen on mammography such that a markedly larger resection is required for complete excision, the findings should be verified histologically through \nMRI-guided biopsy of the more extensive enhancement.  Studies \nperformed to determine whether the use of MRI reduces re -excision rates \nand decreases local recurrence in patients with DCIS s how conflicting \nresults. While several studies suggest no reduction in re -excision rates in \npatients with pure DCIS undergoing breast -conserving surgery (BCS) \nfollowing MRI compared with those who did not undergo preoperative \nMRI,\n13,14 some have demonstrated a reduction in re- excision rate with use \nof preoperative MRI for DCIS .15,16 One study showed an additional cancer \ndetection rate of 6.2% with preoperative MRI .16 Therefore, the use of \npreoperative MRI remains controversial. The NCCN P anel recommends \nonly performing breast MRI for DCIS in select circumstances where \nadditional information is warranted during  the initial workup , noting that t he \nuse of MRI has not been shown to increase likelihood of negative margins \nor dec rease conversion to mastectomy for DCIS.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-4 \nPrimary Treatment for DCIS  \nThe goal of primary therapy for DCIS is to prevent progression to  invasive \nbreast carcinoma. Management strategies for DCIS treatment  include \nsurgery  (mastectomy or BCS) , and/or radiation therapy  (RT), followed by  \nadjuvant endocrine therapy  in eligible patients to reduce risk of recurrence. \nThe choice of local treatment does not impact overall disease- related \nsurvival; therefore, the individual’s preferences for risk  reduction must be \nconsidered.  \nSeveral prospective randomized trials  of pure DCIS  have shown that the \naddition of whole breast RT (WBRT ) after BCS decreases the rate of \nin-breast disease recurrence,17-24 but not  distant metastasis -free survival.25 \nA meta -analysis of four large multicenter randomized trials confirm ed the \nresults of the individual trials, demonstrating that the addition of WBRT  \nafter BCS  for DCIS provides a statistically and clinically significant \nreduction in ipsilateral breast events (hazard ratio  [HR], 0.49; 95% \nconfidence interval [ CI]; 0.41– 0.58, P < .00001 ).26 However, these trials \ndid not show  that the addition of RT has an overall survival (OS) benefit . \nThe long- term follow- up of the NSABP B- 17 trial showed that at 15 years, \nRT resulted in a 52% reduction of ipsilateral invasive recurrence compared \nwith excision alone (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33– 0.69, P < .001).23 The OS \nand cumulative all -cause mortality rate s through 15 years were  similar \nbetween the two groups (HR for death, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.79 –1.48).23 Similar \nfindings were reported by a large observational study of the SEER \ndatabase that included 108,196 patients with DCIS.27 In a subgroup \nanalysis at 10 years, of 60,000 patients  treated with BCS , with or without \nWBRT , a 50% reduction in the risk of ipsilateral recurrence (adjusted HR, \n0.47 [95% CI, 0.42–0.53]; P < .001)  was associated with the addition of \nWBRT. However, in this study, breast cancer -specific mortality was found \nto be similar (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.67 –1.10]; P = .22).27 In contrast, several population- based studies suggest beneficial effects of \nWBRT for DCIS after BCS ; for example , the use of WBRT in patients with \nhigher -risk DCIS (eg , higher nuclear grade, younger age, larger tumor \nsize) was demonstrated to be associated with a modest but statistically \nsignificant improvement in OS .28 In another observational study of the \nSEER database including 140,366 patients with DCIS, the 15 -year breast \ncancer mortality rate was 1.7% for those treated with breast -conserving \ntherapy ( BCT) versus 2.3% for patients treated with BCS alone (HR , 0.77; \n95% CI , 0.67–0.88; P < .001), demonstrating a small but significant \nreduction in breast cancer mortality  with BCS and WBRT  compared with \nBCS alone.29 \nRT Boost : The use of RT boost has been demonstrated to provide a small \nbut statistically significant reduction in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) risk (4% at 20 years) in all age groups for invasive breast \ncancers.\n30-33  \nA pooled analysis  of patient -level data from 10 academic institutions \nevaluated outcomes of pure DCIS patients , all treated with BCS and \nWBRT (n = 4131) who either received RT boost with a median dose of 14 \nGy (n = 2661 ) or received no boost (n = 1470). The median follow -up of \npatients was 9 years . A decrease in IBTR was seen in patients who \nreceived a boost compared with those who did not at 5 years (97.1% vs . \n96.3%), 10 years (94.1% vs . 92.5%), and 15 years (91.6% vs . 88.0%) ( P = \n.0389 for all).  The use o f RT boost was associated with significantly \ndecreased IBTR across the entire cohort of patients (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, \n0.57– 0.94; P = .01).34 In a multivariate analysis that took into account \nfactors  associated with lower IBTR, including grade, ER positive status, \nuse of adjuvant tamoxifen, margin status, and age, the benefit of RT boost still remained statistically significant ( HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53– 0.91;  P < \n.010).\n34 Even in patients considered very low risk based on negative \nmargins  status (defined as no ink on tumor as per NSABP definition, or \nmargins >2 mm as per Society of Surgical Oncology  [SSO]/American PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-5 \nSociety for Radiation Oncology  [ASTRO]/ASCO definition), the RT boost \nremained statistically significant for decreasing the rate of local relapse.   \nSimilar to invasive cancers, though RT boost was beneficial  in all age \ngroups studied, the magnitude of the absolute benefit of the boost was \ngreatest in younger patients. Two randomized phase III trials are studying \nwhether an RT boost reduces recurrence in patients with DCIS \n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00470236 and NCT00907868).  \nThese trials have completed accrual and are now in active follow -up. A \nrecent publication on the health- related quality of life (HRQOL) in patient s \nenrolled in the BIG 3 -07/TROG 07.01  phase III trial (NCT00470236) \nshowed that after 2 years, the cosmetic status was impacted negatively with the boost versus no boost , suggesting the importance of informed \nshared decision- making regarding addition of boost until data related to \nimpact on local recurrence and OS are published.35 According to the 5-\nyear data from this trial, presented at the 2021 annual San Antonio Breast \nCancer Symposium ( SABCS) meeting, 93% of patients in the group who \ndid not receive a boost were free from local recurrence compared with \n97% in the group who received an RT boost (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31–\n0.72;  P < .001).36 The peer -reviewed publication of these data is awaited.   \nBreast Conserving Surgery  Alone Without WBRT : RT adds to treatment \ncost and is  accompanied by adverse effects. Therefore, in an  attempt to \nde-escalate treatment and limit morbidity and preserve quality of life \n(QOL) , several trials have examined  omission of RT in carefully selected \npatients  at low risk of disease  recurrence .  \nThere are retrospective series suggesting that selected patients have a \nlow risk of in -breast recurrence when treated with excision alone (without \nWBRT) .37-40 For example, in one retrospective review, 10- year \ndisease- free survival (DFS) rates of 186 patients with DCIS treated with \nBCS alone w ere 94% for patients with low -risk DCIS and 83% for patients \nwith both intermediate - and high- risk DCIS.37 In another retrospective study of 215 patients with DCIS treated with BCS without RT, or systemic \nrisk reduction therapy , the recurrence rate s over 8 years w ere 0%, 21.5%, \nand 32.1% in patients with low -, intermediate -, or high- risk DCIS, \nrespectively.38 The stratification for risk of recurrence in this retrospective \nstudy was calculated using the modified Van Nuys Prognostic Index based \non tumor  grade, size, absence of comedo necrosis, margin width, and age \nat diagnosis.38    \nA multi-institutional, non- randomized, prospective study of selected \npatients with low -risk DCIS treated without radiation has also provided \nsome support for  BCS alone without radiation.41 Patients were enrolled \nonto one of two low -risk cohorts: 1) low- or intermediate- grade DCIS, \ntumor size ≤ 2.5 cm (n = 561); or 2) high- grade DCIS, tumor size ≤ 1 cm (n \n= 104). Protocol specifications included excision of the DCIS tumor with a \nminimum negative margin width of ≥3 mm. Only 30% of the patients  \nreceived t amoxifen. Of note, margins were substantially wider than the 3-\nmm protocol requirement in many patients (ie, the low- /intermediate- risk \npatient group margins were ≥5 mm in 62% of patients and >10 mm or no \ntumor on re -excision in 48% of patients).41 Although the rate of IBTR was \nacceptably low for the low -/intermediat e-grade group at 5 years , at a \nmedian follow -up of  12.3 years , the rates of developing an IBTR were \n14.4% for  low-/intermediate- grade and 24.6% for high- grade DCIS ( P = \n.003). This suggests that  IBTR events may be delayed but not prevented  \nin the seemingly low -risk population.  \nThe RTOG 9804 trial investigated outcomes of RT omission in the setting \nof low -risk DCIS, randomizing 636 patients with low- risk disease to either \nRT or observation after surgery .24 In this study, low risk consisted of low - \nto intermediate- grade DCIS measuring <2.5 cm, with negative margins of  \n≥3 mm. With a median follow -up of 7 years, a reduced risk of local \nrecurrence was seen with use of RT compared with observation (0.9%  vs. \n6.7%; HR , 0.11; 95% CI , 0.03– 0.47). No difference was seen in either \nDFS or OS.

Patients with DCIS constituted 25%,  18%, \n8.8%, and 6% of patients in the NSABP B -39/RTOG 0413 , OCOG -RAPID, \nUniversity of Florence, and GEC -ESTRO trials, respectively.  Per the \nASTRO guideline for APBI, patients with screen -detected DCIS measuring \n<2.5 cm, with grade I or II disease, and with negative margins of 3 mm or \nmore are “suitable” candidates for APBI.47   \nMargin Status  After Breast -Conserving Therapy : Prospective randomized \ntrials have not been carried out to analyze whether wider margins can \nreplace the need for RT for DCIS.  Results from a retrospective study of \n445 patients with pure DCIS treated by excision alone indicated that margin width was the most important independent predictor of local \nrecurrence, although the trend for decreasing local recurrence risk with \nincreasi ng margin width was most apparent with margins <1 mm \ncompared to  ≥10 mm.\n48 In a meta -analysis of 4660 patients with DCIS \ntreated with BCS and radiation, a surgical margin of < 2 mm was \nassociated with increased rates of IBTR compared with margins of 2 mm, although no significant differences were observed when margins of >2 mm \nto 5 mm or >5 mm were compared with 2 -mm margins.\n49 \nA study  retrospectively reviewed a database of 2996 patients with DCIS \nwho underwent BCS  to investigate the association between margin width \nand recurrence, controlling all other characteristics.50 Wider margins were  \nsignificantly associated with a lower rate of recurrence only in patients who did not receive RT ( P  <  .0001), but not in those treated with radiation  (P  = \n .95).50 \nAccording to the DCIS Consensus Guideline on Margins  by \nSSO/ASTRO/ASCO,  the use of at least a 2- mm margin in DCIS treated \nwith WBRT is associated with low rates of IBTR .47 Additional factors to \nconsider in assessing adequacy of excision for DCIS include presence of \nresidual calcifications , which margin is close  (anterior against skin or \nposterior against muscle vs . medial, superior, inferior, or lateral), and life \nexpectancy of the patient. Notably, in situations where DCIS is admixed \nwith invasive carcinoma, the SSO/ASTRO/ASCO Consensus Guideline on \nMargins for  invasive breast  cancer should be utilized, which support s “no \ntumor on ink ” as an adequate margin appl ying to both the invasive and \nnoninvasive components in this mixed tumor scenario.   \nMastectomy : Patients  with DCIS and evidence of widespread disease (ie, \ndisease involving two or more quadrants) on diagnostic mammography or \nother imaging, physical examination, or biopsy may require mastectomy.   \nFor DCIS  patients undergoing mastectomy , or for local excision in an \nanatomic location that could compromise the lymphatic drainage pattern to \nthe axilla (eg,  tail of the breast), a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)  \nprocedure should strongly  be considered at the time of definitive surgery \nto avoid necessitating a full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for \nevaluation of the axilla.51-54 Since only a small proportion of patients (about \n25%) with seemingly pure DCIS on initial biopsy will have invasive breast \ncancer at the time of the definitive surgical procedure55 and will ultimately \nrequire axillary lymph node ( ALN) staging, ALND  is not recommended \nunless there is pathologically documented invasive cancer or ALN \nmetastatic disease in patients  (by either biopsy or SNLB).  \nNCCN Recommendations for Primary Treatment of DCI  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-7 \nTrials are ongoing to determine if there might be a selected favorable \nbiology DCIS subgroup where surgical excision is not required. Until such \ntime that definitive evidence regarding the safety of this non- surgical \napproach is demonstrated, the NCCN P anel continues to recommend \nsurgical excision for all DCIS.  \n According to the NCCN Panel, primary treatment options for patients with \nDCIS along with their respective categories of consensus are:  \n1) BCS plus WBRT with or without boost (category 1). While considering \nRT boost for DCIS, the NCCN Panel recommends an individualized \napproach based on patient preference and other factors such as longevity.  \nThe NCCN Panel notes that WBRT following BCS reduces IBTR  rates  in \nDCIS by about 50%  to 70%. For DCIS patients treated with BCS alone \n(without radiation), irrespective of margin width, the risk of IBTR is substantially higher than treatment with excision followed by WBRT (even \nfor predefined low -risk subsets of DCIS patients).  \n2) Total mastectomy, with or without SLNB with optional  reconstruction \n(category 2A).  \n3) BCS plus APBI in carefully selected patients  (category 2A).  According \nto the Panel, s elect patients with low -risk DCIS may be considered \nsuitable for APBI  if they meet all aspects of the definition of RTOG 9804 \nlow-risk DCIS or ASTRO “suitable” DCIS for APBI.  \n4) BCS alone (category 2B) . The option of BCS alone should be \nconsidered only in cases where the patient and the physician view the \nindividual as having a low risk of disease recurrence. For patients with \nlow-risk disease that has been fully resected with negative margins and \nparticularly if they are ER -positive and will be receiving endocrine therapy, \nthe absolute reduction of in- breast recurrence may not be large enough to \njustify the ri sks associated with RT. Therefore, according to the NCCN \nPanel, it may be reasonable to omit RT in such cases.  \n Contraindications to BCT are listed in the algorithm ( see Special \nConsiderations to Breast  Conserv ation  Therapy Requiring R T). Patients  \ntreated with mastectomy are appropriate candidates for breast \nreconstruction (see Principles of Breast Reconstruction Following Surgery  \nin the algorithm ).  \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, complete resection should be documented \nby analysis of margins and specimen radiography. Post -excision \nmammography can be considered for any uncertainty about adequacy of the excision remains (eg, the mass and/or microcalcifications are not \nclearly within the specimen). C lips may be used  to delineate the tumor bed \nand ensure adequate coverage with radiation, provide design of boost and APBI fields, and provide markers should additional surgery be required \npending the pathologic margin status review . \nFor patients with pure DCIS treated by BCS and WBRT, a quantitative \ndescription of any tumor close to margin is helpful as a  resection width of \nat least 2 mm is associated with a reduced risk of IBTR relative to \nnarrower negative margin widths.  The routine practice of obtaining \nmargins >2 mm to further improve outcomes is not supported by the \nevidence. When there is only minimal or focal DCIS involvement near the \nmargin, clinical judgment should be utilized to weigh the risks of re -\nexcision with risk of recurrence for an individual patient .  \nFor patients with DCIS treated with excision alone (no WBRT), regardless \nof margin width, there is a substantially higher rate of IBTR than treatment \nwith excision and WBRT, even in predefined, low -risk patients. Although \nthe optimal margin width for treat ment with excision alone is unknown, it \nshould be at least  2 mm, with some evidence suggesting improved IBTR \nrates with margin widths wider than 2 mm.  \nFor DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS -M), defined as an invasive focus 1 mm  \nor smaller  in size, the optimal margin width should refer to the DCIS PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial  performed by NSABP \nshowed a 75% reduction in the occurrence of invasive breast cancer in \npatients with ADH treated with tamoxifen.56,57 These data also showed that \ntamoxifen led to a substantial reduction in the risk of developing invasive breast disease.\n58 The Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group \n(EBCTCG ) overv iew analysis showed that, with 5 years of tamoxifen \ntherapy, patients  with ER-positive or receptor -unknown invasive tumors \nhad a 39% reduction in the annual odds of recurrence of invasive breast  \ncancer.59 \nSimilarly, the NSABP B -24 trial found a benefit from tamoxifen for patients  \nwith DCIS after treatment with breast conservation surgery and RT . In that \nstudy, patients  with DCIS who were treated with BCT were randomized to \nreceive placebo or tamoxifen. At a median follow -up of 13.6 years, \npatients who received tamoxifen had a 3.4% absolute reduction in \nipsilateral in -breast tumor recurrence risk (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.21– 0.42; P \n< .001) and a 3.2% absolute reduction in contralateral breast cancers (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.48– 0.95; P = .023).\n23 The patients  receiving tamoxifen had \na 10- year cumulative rate of 4.6%  for invasive and 5.6% for noninvasive \nbreast cancer s in the ipsilateral breast , compared with 7.3% invasive and \n7.2% noninvasive recurrences for those treated with placebo. The \ncumulative 10 -year frequency of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer in \nthe contralateral breast was 6.9% and 4.7% in the placebo and tamoxifen groups, respectively. No differences in OS were noted. A retrospective analysis of ER expression in NSABP B- 24 suggests that increased levels \nof ER expression predict for tamoxifen benefit in terms of risk reduction for \nipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer development following BCT .\n60 \nA phase III trial  randomized patients  with excised DCIS to  receive WBRT \nor no WBRT and  tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen .22 The randomization was \nindependent for each of the two treatments (RT and tamoxifen). With 12.7 \nyears of median follow- up, the use of tamoxifen decreased all new breast \nevents (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58– 0.88; P = .002). The use of tamoxifen \ndecreased ipsilateral and contralateral breast events in the subjects not \ngiven WBRT (ipsilateral HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59– 0.98; contralateral HR, \n0.27; 95% CI , 0.12–0.59), but not in those receiving WBRT (ipsilateral HR, \n0.93; 95% CI , 0.50–1.75; P = .80; contralateral HR , 0.99; 95% CI, 0.39–\n2.49; P = 1.0).  \nThe standard dose of tamoxifen is 20 mg/day for 5 years. The phase III TAM -01 trial studied a lower dose of tamoxifen (5 mg for 3 years) in 501 \npatients with breast intraepithelial neoplasia including DCIS, lobular \ncarcinoma in situ (LCIS), and ADH . The rate of recurrence of either \nintraepithelial neoplasia or invasive breast cancer was 5.7% among those \nreceiving tamoxifen  5 mg daily versus 11.9% for those receiving placebo \n(HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25 –0.89) at a median follow -up of 5.1 years.61 The \nrelative risk (RR) reduction with low- dose tamoxifen seen in the TAM -01 \ntrials is consistent with that seen in trials that used a higher dose of \ntamoxifen, but the rate of severe toxicity compared with placebo was less.  \nAnastrozole: In  patients with ER -positive and/or PR -positive DCIS treated \nby wide local excision with or without RT, a large, randomized, \ndouble- blind, placebo- controlled trial (IBIS -II) compared anastrozole (n  = \n1471)  with tamoxifen  (n = 1509) . The results demonstrated non -inferiority \nof anastrozole to tamoxifen.62 After a median follow -up of 7.2 years,  67 \nrecurrences were reported with anastrozole v ersus 77 for tamoxifen ( HR, \n0.89; 95% CI , 0.64–1. 23).

There were \nmore fractures, musculoskeletal events,  hypercholesterolemia, and \nstrokes reported with anastrozole and more muscle spasm s, gynecologic \ncancers and symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, and deep vein thromboses \nreported with tamoxifen.  The NSABP B- 35 study randomly assigned 3104 \npostmenopausal patients  with hormone -positive DCIS treated with \nlumpectomy and radiation to either tamoxifen or anastrozole for 5 years. \nPrior to being randomly assigned, patients were stratified by age—< 60 \nyears  or >60 years . The primary endpoint was breast cancer -free \ninterval.63 Anastrozole treatment resulted in an overall statistically \nsignificant decrease in breast cancer -free interval events compared with \ntamoxifen (HR , 0.73; 95% CI , 0.56–0. 96; P = .0234) . The significant \ndifference in breast cancer -free interval between the two treatments was \napparent in the study only after 5 years of follow -up. The estimated \npercentage of patients with a 10- year breast cancer -free interval was \n89.1% in the  tamoxifen group and 93. 1% in the anastrozole  group.63 In \naddition, anastrozole resulted in further improvement in breast cancer -free \ninterval in younger postmenopausal patients ( <60 years of age). With \nrespect to adverse effects, the overall incidence of thrombosis or \nembolism was higher in the tamoxifen group while the anastrozole group \nhad slightly more cases of arthralgia and myalgia .63  \nResults  of the IBIS -II and the NSA BP-B- 35 studies indicate that \nanastrozole provides at least a comparable benefit  as adjuvant  treatment \nfor postmenopausal patients  with hormone receptor  (HR) -positive DCIS  \ntreated with BCS and RT, with a different toxicity profile.    \nSurveillance after treatment for DCIS  helps early recognition of disease \nrecurrences  (either DCIS or invasive disease) and  evaluation and management of  therapy -related complications. The majority of recurrences \nof DCIS are in -breast recurrences after BCT,  and recurrences most ly \noccur in close proximity  to the location of the prior disease.  Overall, \napproximately one- half of the local recurrences after initial treatment for a \npure DCIS are invasive in nature, whereas the remainder recur as pure DCIS . \nNCCN Recommendations  for Management of DCIS After Primary \nTreatment   \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, in patients with ER- positive DCIS treated \nwith BCT, endocrine therapy with tamoxifen (for premenopausal and \npostmenopausal patients) or an aromatase inhibitor  (AI) (for \npostmenopausal patients, especially those <60 years of age or in those \nwith concerns of embolism) may be considered as a strategy to reduce the \nrisk of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence (category 1 for those \nundergoing BCT followed by RT ; category 2A for those undergoing \nexcision alone). The benefit of endocrine therapy for ER- negative DCIS is \nnot known. Low -dose tamoxifen (5 mg/day for 3 years) is an option only if \nthe 20 -mg standard- dose of tamoxifen  is not tolerated (see DCIS -2 in the \nalgorithm ).  \nFollow- up of patients  with DCIS include s interval history and physical \nexamination every 6 to 12 months for 5  years and then annually, as well \nas yearly diagnostic mammography . In patients treated with BCT, the first \nfollow- up mammogram should be performed 6 to 12 months after the \ncompletion of RT (category 2B) (see DCIS -2 in the algorithm ). Patients \nreceiving endocrine therapy for risk reduction should be monitored as described in the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer Risk Reduction.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-10 \nInvasive Breast Cancer  \nWorkup  for Non -metastatic (M0) Invasive Breast Cancer  \nThe recommended workup of localized invasive breast cancer (listed on \nBINV -1 in the algorithm ) includes  a history and physical exam ination . \nComplete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests (LFTs) have no \nadded benefit in the detection of underlying metastatic disease in patients \nwith asymptomatic early -stage breast cancers.64 In addition, monitoring of \ndisease relapse with any tumor markers is not  recommended.  \nImaging: Imaging with bilateral diagnostic mammography  is \nrecommended; breast ultrasonography  is recommended only if  necessary .  \nThe use of MRI in the workup remains controversial. Breast MRI \nadvocates note its high sensitivity for evaluation of extent of disease, \nparticularly for invasive cancer and in dense breasts where \nmammographically occult disease is more likely to elude preoperative \ndetection. MRI detractors note that MRI has  a high percentage of \nfalse -positive findings , resulting in further diagnostic workup —including \nMRI-guided biopsy —in many circumstances .65-67 MRI findings tend to \noverestimate extent of disease,68 resulting in increased  frequency of \nmastectomies.69-72 \nMRI findings alone are not sufficient to determine whether BCT is optimal,  \nas additional tissue sampling is needed to verify true malignant disease warranting excision. MRI use may increase mastectomy rates by \nidentifying areas of mammographically occult disease that may have been \nadequately treated with radiation after BCS  had the disease remained \nundiscovered without MRI.\n72 \nTwo prospective randomized studies have examined the utility of preoperative MRI in determining disease extent, and neither demonstrated \nimprovement in rates of re- excision  after initial BCS .\n73,74 Retrospective review of the utility of MRI showed conflicting outcome results — one with \nbenefit75 and another without .76 One systematic review67 documented that \nbreast MRI staging altered surgical treatment in 7.8% to 33.3% of \npatients;67 however, no differences in local recurrence or survival have \nbeen demonstrated. In addition,  there is no evidence that use of breast \nMRI increases rates of margin- negative resection.77,78 \nBreast MRI may assist with identification and management of clinically \noccult primary tumors  presenting with axillary nodal metastases .79 In \npatients with Paget disease not identifiable on mammography,  breast MRI \nmay help determine  the extent of disease.80,81 Breast MRI also has utility \nin screening patients with higher than average risk based on family \nhistory.82  \nIf breast MRI imaging is performed, a dedicated breast coil, an imaging \nteam experienced with reading breast MRI  and performing MRI -guided \nbiopsy, and multidisciplinary management are the standard of care.  \nAccording to the NCCN Panel,  the u se of MRI is optional and is not \nuniversally recommended by experts in the field. Breast MRI may  be used \nfor staging evaluation to define extent of cancer , in the adjuvant or \nneoadjuvant setting, to detect the presence of multifocal or multicentric \ncancer in the ipsilateral  breast, or as screening of the contralateral breast \ncancer at time  of initial diagnosis . Additional indications for breast MRI \ninclude: c linical axillary metastasis with an occult primary  cancer ; Paget \ndisease of the nipple with breast primary not identified by other breast imaging modalities or  physical examination ; follow- up screening of \npatients with prior mammographically undetected breast  cancer s; and \nthose whose lifetime risk of a second primary breast cancer is > 20% \n(based on models largely dependent on family histor y). \nPathology Assessment : A central component of the treatment of breast \ncancer is full knowledge of extent of disease and biologic features.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-11 \nknowledge of extent of disease and biologic features is central to the \ntreatment of breast cancer.  \nThe specimens should be oriented for the pathologist, and specific requests for determination of biomarkers should be stated (eg, ER, PR, \nand HER2 status). The P anel also recommends testing for Ki -67 if HR-\npositive, HER2 -negative, and considering adjuvant abemaciclib.  \nAccurate pathology reporting requires communication between the \nclinician and the pathologist relating to relevant patient history, prior breast \nbiopsies, prior irradiation to the chest, pregnancy status, characteristics of \nthe abnormality biopsied (eg, palpable, mammographically detected \nmicrocalcifications), clinical state of lymph nodes, presence of \ninflammatory change or other skin abnormality, and any prior treatment \nadministered (eg, chemotherapy, RT ). The specimens should be oriented \nfor the pathologist, and specific requests for determination of biomarkers should be stated. The use of consistent, unambiguous standards for \nreporting is strongly encouraged. Data from both national and local \nsurveys show that as many as 50% of pathology reports for breast cancer \nare missing some elements critical to disease management.\n12,13 Significant \nomissions include failure to orient and report surgical margins and failure \nto report tumor grade  consistently. The CAP has developed pathology \nreporting protocols to pro mote complete and standardized reporting of  \nmalignant specimens. CAP provides a protocol for each disease site that \nincludes cancer case summaries (checklists) along with background \ndocumentation. These checklists form the basis for a synoptic, \nstandardized reporting of pathologic findings. The chec klists are available \nwithout charge through the CAP website at www.cap.org . Consistent, \nunambiguous, and complete pathology reporting is a cornerstone of \nquality breast cancer care.  The NCCN Breast Cancer Panel endorses the \nuse of the CAP protocols for reporting the pathologic analysis of all breast \ncancer specimens.5  Genetic Counseling: For patients considered to be at high risk for \nhereditary breast cancer as defined by the NCCN Guidelines for \nGenetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic , \ngenetic counseling is recommended.  \nDistress Assessment:  Levels of distress may vary in patients and should \nbe addressed individually . Psychological distress can be impacted by body \nimage and other factors. Younger patients  have higher rates of \npsychosocial distress than patients  diagnosed at older ages.83-87 The \nNCCN Breast Cancer Panel recommends assessing for distress in \npatients newly diagnosed with breast cancer  using guidance from NCCN \nGuidelines for Distress Management . \n \nFertility and Sexual Health: The general considerations for fertility and \nsexual health/function outlined for specific populations  in NCCN \nGuidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology  and NCCN \nGuidelines for Survivorship  are applicable to all patients diagnosed with \nbreast cancer . The P anel recommends referring to those guidelines for \nguidance.  \n \nNumerous epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that childbearing \nafter treatment for invasive breast cancer does not increase rates of \nrecurrence or death from breast cancer.88 The offspring of pregnancies \nafter treatment for breast cancer do not have an increased rate of birth \ndefects or other serious childhood illness. However, treatment for breast \ncancer, especially with cytotoxic agents, may impair fertility  and fertility \nmay wane during the 5 to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy .  \nWhile the potential to regain menstrual function within 2 years of \ncompleting chemotherapy  is possible, especially  for those <35 years of \nage,89 resumption of menses does not correlate with fertility, and \nconversely, fertility may be preserved without menses.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-12 \npremenopausal patients should be informed about the potential impact of \nchemotherapy on fertility and offered the option of fertility preservation if \nfuture childbearing is desired.  \nConsiderations for fertility preservation should incorporate patient \npreference, tumor stage and biology, age of the patient, risk of premature \novarian failure based on anticipated type and duration of chemotherapy \nand/or endocrine therapy, as well as the timing and duration allowed for \nfertility preservation.  \nSeveral studies report lower rates of fertility discussion among female \npatients with cancer90-92 despite the updated ASCO guidelines stating that \npatients should not be excluded from consideration for discussion of \nfertility preservation for any reason, including parity, prognosis, age, and \nsocioeconomic status.93 The NCCN P anel recommends that all treating \nphysicians  should have a discussion with their  patients  of childbearing \npotential regarding the options for fertility preservation. Patients who \ndesire to bear children after systemic therapy should be referred to a \nfertility specialist prior to initiating systemic (chemotherapy or endocrine) \ntherapy.93-99  \nRandomized trials have demonstrated that GnRH agonists (such as \ngoserelin) administered prior to initiating chemotherapy and then \nadministered concurrently with adjuvant chemotherapy protect against \novarian failure and reduce the risk of early menopause.100-102 In one trial \ngoserelin improved the probability of pregnancy from 11% to 21% in patients with HR- negative early -stage breast cancer.\n103 Smaller historical \nexperiences in patients with HR- positive disease have conflicting results \nwith respect to the protective effects of GnRH agonists in fertility \npreservation.  \nPatients should be informed of all the various modalities available to \nminimize gonadal damage and preserve ovarian function and future fertility. The fertility specialist should discuss specifics of fertility \npreservation options including hormonal interventions , ovarian stimulation, \nembryo or oocyte cryopreservation , and other investigational options, as \nwell as the probability of successful gestation and childbirth.104,105   \nCombining the various modalities for a specific patient may increase the \nodds of preservation of future fertility. It is important for fetal safety that \npatients  actively avoid becoming pregnant during breast cancer treatment.  \nAdditional Diagnostic Workup  \nThe Panel has reiterated that routine systemic imaging is not  indicated for \npatients with early -stage breast cancer in the absence of signs/symptoms \nof metastatic disease.  Recommendations for additional metastatic workup  \nshould be performed for those patients with signs or symptoms suspicious \nfor metastatic disease , based on lack of evidence to demonstrate any \nbenefits with metastatic workup in early -stage disease.106-108 In one study, \nmetastases were identified by bone scan in 5.1%, 5.6%, and 14% of patients with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively, and no evidence of \nmetastasis was detected by liver ultrasonography or chest radiography in \npatients with stage I or II disease.\n106 For patients with stage III breast \ncancer, the prevalence of a positive liver ultrasound and positive chest x-ray was 6% and 7% , respectively.\n106 \nCBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function, and alkaline \nphosphatase  tests should be considered only if the patient is a candidate \nfor preoperative or adjuvant systemic therapy . A bone scan or sodium \nfluoride PET/CT is indicated in patients presenting with localized bone \npain or elevated alkaline phosphatase.

The routine use of FDG -PET/CT \nscanning is not recommended in the staging of clinical stage I, II, or \noperable III (T3 ,N1) breast cancer , due to its high false- negative rate for \nthe detection of lesions that are small (<1 cm) and/or low -grade  disease, \nthe high rate of false -positive scans  in patients without locally advanced \ndisease, the low sensitivity for detection of axillary nodal metastases, and the low probability of these patients having detectable metastatic \ndisease.\n109- 112  \nLocoregional Treatment of cT1–3, cN0 or cN+, M0  Disease  \nSurgery  \nPatients w ith early -stage operable breast cancer initially undergo upfront \ndefinitive surgery (BCS or mastectomy), and adjuvant systemic therapy if \nindicated, based on primary tumor characteristics, such as tumor size, \ngrade, lymph node involvement, ER/PR status, expression of HER2 \nreceptor, and tumor genomics. Some patients with early -stage operable \nHER2 -positive or triple- negative disease may be treated with preoperative \nsystemic therapy first, followed by surgery. For NCCN Panel recommendations and consi deration for preoperative systemic therapy, \nrefer to \nwww.NCCN.org . Radiation is typically sequenced after definitive \nsurgery and after systemic chemotherapy (if delivered).   \nSeveral randomized trials document that mastectomy is equivalent to \nBCT, which includes BCS with WBRT with respect to OS as primary treatment for the majority of patients with stage I and stage II breast \ncancers (category 1).113-117 The optimal choice of surgery is based on a \nshared decision made by the patient and clinician after discussing benefits \nand risks of mastectomy versus BCT in regards to long- term survival, risk \nof local recurrence, and the impact on cosmetic outcome and ov erall QOL.  \nBreast Conserving Surgery  \nBCS allows patients to preserve their breast without sacrificing oncologic \noutcome.

This process should \ninvolve multidisciplinary consultations prior to surgery, and should include a discussion of the risks associated with development of a contralateral \nbreast cancer as compared with the risks associated with recurrent \ndisease from the  primary cancer. Except as specifically outlined in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, \nOvarian, and Pancreatic , risk reduction mastectomy of the contralateral \nbreast to a known unilateral breast cancer treated with mastectomy or BCT is discouraged by the P anel.  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends referring to the NCCN Guidelines for Older \nAdult Oncology  for special considerations for this population.  \nMargin Assessment : After surgical resection, a careful histologic \nassessment of resection margins is essential. The NCCN Panel notes that \nbenefit of BCS is predicated on achieving pathologically negative margins \nafter resection.  The NCCN Panel accepts the most recent definition \noutlined in the guidelines established by the SSO/ASTRO as the standard \nfor negative surgical margins for invasive cancer.134  \nFor patients with stage I or II invasive cancers after BCS, a positive margin \nis defined as “ink on tumor” (any invasive cancer or DCIS cells on ink). Patients with positive margins generally require further surgery —either a \nre-excision to achieve a negative margin or a mastectomy. If re -excision is \ntechnically feasible to ac hieve “no ink on tumor,” this can be done with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

For these patients, the margin status would be asses sed \nwith similar definitions. If  margins remain positive after further surgical \nre-excision(s), then mastectomy may be required for optimal local disease \ncontrol.  \nIn order to adequately assess margins following surgery, the P anel \nrecommends that the surgical specimens be directionally oriented and that the pathologist provide descriptions of the gross and microscopic margin \nstatus and the distance, orientation, and type of tumor (invasive cancer or \npure DCIS) in relation to the closest margin. Marking the tumor bed with \nclips facilitates accurate planning of the radiation boost field, where appropriate.  \nFor invasive breast cancers that have a component of DCIS , the negative \nmargin definition of “no ink on tumor” should be utilized based on the \nSSO/ASTRO Consensus Guideline on Margins  unless it is DCIS -M, which \nbehaves more like pure DCIS and 2 -mm margins are recommended. In \nthis setting, “no ink on tumor” is recommended for either DCIS or invasive \ncancer cells, primarily because the natural history, treatment, and \noutcomes of these lesions are more similar to invasive cancer than DCIS.  \nFor specifically challenging cases, clinical judgment and discussion with the patient should precede routine re -excision.  \nThe same margin recommendations cannot be applied directly to patients \nundergoing APBI, where data regarding local recurrence are more limited  \nthan WBRT. Individualized clinical judgment should be utilized on a case -\nby-case basis, using postoperative mammography to  identify residual \ncalcifications and clinical -pathologic factors such as quantitative extent of \ndisease near margin, presence of extensive intraductal component (EIC), \nyoung age, or multiple close margins to assist in identifying patients who may have an increased risk of ipsilateral recurrence and therefore may \nbenefit from re-excision. \nSurgical Axillary Staging  \nAxillary status is important for planning systemic adjuvant treatment and \nRT. The lymphatic pathways from the breast go to the ALNs, internal \nmammary, infraclavicular, and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes.  \nTraditional level I and level II ALN Ds require that at least 10 lymph nodes \nbe provided for pathologic evaluation to accurately stage the axilla.\n135,136 \nALND should be extended to include level III nodes only if gross disease is \napparent in the level II and I nodes.  In the absence of gross disease in \nlevel II nodes, lymph node dissection should include tissue inferior to the axillary vein from the latissimus dorsi muscle laterally to the medial border \nof the pectoralis minor muscle (level s I and II).  \nHistorically, ALND has been the standard of care for axillary staging.137 \nHowever, ALND  is associated with lymphedema and other significant \nmorbidities.138-140 This has been largely replaced with SLNB.  \nSLN mapping injections may be peritumoral, subareolar, or subdermal.  \nSLNs can be assessed for the presence of metastases by both \nhematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and cytokeratin \nimmunohistochemistry ( IHC). The clinical significance of a lymph node that \nis negative by H&E staining but positive by cytokeratin IHC is not clear. Because the historical and clinical trial data on which treatment decisions \nare based have relied on H&E staining, the P anel does not recommend \nroutine cytokeratin IHC to define node involvement and believes that current treatment decisions should be made based solely on H&E staining. \nThis recommendation is further supported by a randomized clinical trial \n(ACOSOG Z0010)\n for patients with H&E negative nodes where further \nexamination by cytokeratin IHC was not associated with improved OS over PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

The Milan \ntrial (1998– 1999) randomized 516 patients treated with BCS with tumors \n≤2 cm to two arms, one receiving immediate axillary dissection and the \nother receiving the dissection only if the sentinel node was involved.142 \nAfter 79 months of follow- up, there was no difference in OS and DFS.143 \nAnother similar study, NSABP B -32, conducted between 1999 and 2004, \nrandomized 5611 patients with invasive breast cancer ≤2 cm to either \nALND or SLNB alone with ALND performed only if the SLN was \npositive.144 After 95.6 months of follow -up, OS and DFS were similar in the \ntwo groups. Results of a subgroup analysis of this study showed patients \nwith ALND had significantly higher arm morbidity and significantly more \nrestricted work and social activity and impaired QOL.145,146 \nThe ALMANAC trial studied the QOL  in patients (n= 1031) with SLNB \nversus ALND.147 After 12 months, lymphedema and sensory loss were \nhigher in the ALND group. Operative time, drainage use, hospitalization, \nand resumption of normal life were much longer in ALND compared to the \nSLNB group. The SNAC trial148 and the DBCCG trial149 also showed less \nmorbidity with SLNB compared with ALND.  \nBased on the results of the above studies, it was clarified that for negative  \nsentinel nodes, ALND is not needed.  \nThe ACOSOG Z0011 trial addressed the role of ALND in those with a \nclinically negative axilla but pathologically positive lymph nodes from an \nSLNB. This trial randomized patients  ≥18 years of age with clinical T1/T2 \ntumors, fewer than 3 positive SLNs, undergoing BCS  and WBRT, to  SLNB  \nalone (n = 436)  or to a completion ALN D (n = 420). In this study, there was \nno difference in local recurrence, DFS , or OS between patients  with positive SLN undergoing a completion ALND  versus no ALND . Only \nER-negative status, age <50 years , and lack of adjuvant systemic therapy \nwere associated with decreased OS.150 At a median follow -up of 6.3 years, \nlocoregional recurrences were noted in 4.1% of patients in the ALN D \ngroup and 2.8% of patients in the SLNB  group (P = .11). Median OS was \napproximately 92% in each group.151 Long- term follow- up (median 9.25 \nyears) results of the ACOSOG Z0011 study showed no statistically significant difference in local recurrence -free survival  (RFS) between trial \narms  (P = .13) .\n152 The cumulative incidence of ipsilateral axillary \nrecurrences at 10 years was 0.5 % (2 patients) in those who underwent \nALND and 1.5% (5 patients) in those who underwent SLNB alone (P = \n.28).152 The 10- year cumulative incidence of loc oregional recurrences was \n6.2% with ALND and 5.3 % with SLNB  alone (P = .36).152  \nThe results of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial demonstrate that there is no \nbenefit to ALND in patients  with early -stage breast cancer who have only \none or two SLN  metastases  (minimal nodal burden) on SLNB after \nreceiving WBRT  as part of BCT.

One thousand four hundred twenty -five patients had  positive SLN s \n(micrometastatic or macrometastatic), which  included a small fraction of \npatients (n = 248) treated with mastectomy  (17%).154 The results reported \nno difference in 5- year OS or DFS for patients randomized to ALND \nversus axillary radiation.154 The 5- year DFS was 86.9% (95% CI , 84.1–\n89.3) in the ALND group and 82.7% (79.3– 85.5) in the axillary RT group.  \nThe 5- year OS was 93.3% (95% CI, 91.0 –95.0) in the ALND  group and \n92.5% (90.0–94.4) in the axillary RT  group.154 At the end of 5 years, \nlymphedema was less  frequent in the group treated with axillary RT versus \nALND (11 % vs. 23%).154 The 10- year follow -up results presented at the \n2021 SABCS showed no significant differences between the two  arms with \nrespect to OS (with ALND, OS was 84.6% vs . 81.4% with axillary RT) , \ndistant metastasis -free survival (with ALND was 81.7% vs . 78.2% with \naxillary RT ), or locoregional recurrence rate (3.59% with ALND vs . 4.07% \nwith axillary RT ). The axillary recurrence  with axillary  RT was 1.8% v ersus  \n0.93% with ALND.155  \nThe OTOASAR trial was designed similarly to the AMAROS trial; patients \n(n = 2100) with tumors ≤3.0 cm who were clinically node negative were \nrandomized to receive either ALND or axillary RT if they had 1 to 2 positive SLNs.\n156 The results showed no difference in axillary recurrence \nwith ALND compared with SLNB plus RT to the axilla.156 In the setting of preoperative chemotherapy, the question that is being explored is whether ALND may be omitted in patients with complete \npathologic response after preoperative therapy.  \nSeveral prospective studies have evaluated patients with positive lymph nodes before preoperative systemic therapy who had clinical complete \nresponse to preoperative therapy and underwent SLNB and ALND. The \nresults of these studies have shown that in those with node- positive \ndisease prior to preoperative systemic therapy, SLNB has  a >10% false-\nnegative rate when performed after preoperative systemic therapy. In the \nSENTINA study,157 the overall false- negative rate was 14.2%. In the \nACOSOG -Z1071 trial,158 the false- negative rate was 12.6% and in the SN \nFNAC trial,159 the false- negative rate was 13.3%.  \nSubgroup analyses from studies have shown that 1) using dual -agent \nlymphatic mapping (radiotracer and blue dye); 2) identifying three or more \nSLNs ; and 3) marking the metastatic lymph node with a clip before \nneoadjuvant therapy and then resecting it at the time of surgery reduces \nfalse -negative rates to <10%.  \nA subgroup analysis of the ACOSOG Z1071 trial showed lower false-\nnegative rates in patients who had a clip placed in the positive lymph \nnodes at the time of initial biopsy followed by removal of the clipped node \nduring SLN surgery after preoperative systemic therapy.160 A another \nstudy of selective localization and removal of clipped nodes with SLN B, \nknown as targeted axillary dissection (TAD), showed false- negative rates \nreduced to approximately 2% compared with 4% with removal of the \nclipped lymph node alone.161 \nSeveral ongoing clinical trials are examining further de -escalation of \naxillary surgery in those who have positive nodes  after preoperative \nsystemic treatment .

The SLNB alone \narm will include axillary RT to the undissected axilla (levels I –III), whereas \nthe ALND arm will not include RT to levels I or II axillae.  \nNCCN Recommendations for Surgical Axillary Staging : If ALNs  are \nclinically negative (no palpable nodes) at the time of diagnosis , ≤2 \nsuspicious lymph nodes are found on imaging,  or ≤2 positive lymph nodes \nare confirmed by needle biopsy , the Panel recommends SLN mapping.  \nIf SLN is negative, no further surgery is needed in these patients. If SLN is \npositive, based on the ACOSOG Z 0011 data, no further surgery is \nrecommended only if all of the following criteria are met: the patients have \ncT1– 2, N0 tumors, have not received preoperative systemic therapy, only \nhave 1 or  2 positive SLNs, and will undergo BCT (BCS + WBRT). If any of \nthe above criteria are not met, the P anel recommends level I and II axillary \ndissection.   \nBased on the AMAROS and OTASAR trial data, no further surgery is \nrecommended only if all of the following criteria are met: the patients have \ncT1– 2, N0 tumors, have not received preoperative systemic therapy, have \n1 to 2 positive SLNs, and will under go lumpectomy or mastectomy along \nwith adjuvant RT with intentional inclusion of undissected axilla at risk. If \nany of the above criteria are not met, the P anel recommends level I and II \naxillary dissection. In select patients undergoing mastectomy with clinically  \nnegative axillae but 1 to 2 positive SLNs, the P anel notes that axillary \nradiation may replace ALND for regional control of disease. Based on the \nresults of the IBCSG 23- 01 trial, the NCCN Panel recommends no ALND \nfor patients with positive SLNs when that disease is limited to only  \nmicrometastatic. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer \n(AJCC) staging, micrometastatic nodal involvement is defined as a \nmetastatic deposit or > 0.2 mm but ≤2.0 mm.162  In patients with c linically suspicious (palpable) lymph nodes or 3 or more \nsuspicious lymph nodes on imaging, or if preoperative systemic therapy is \nbeing considered for patients with suspicious lymph nodes at diagnosis on \nexam ination or imaging, the Panel recommends pathologic confirmation of \nmalignancy using ultrasound- guided fine- needle aspiration (FNA)163 or \ncore biopsy of suspicious nodes with clip placement.  \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, the recommendation for ALND of level I \nand II nodes is limited to patients with biopsy -proven axillary metastases \n(in those who did not receive preoperative systemic therapy) or who have \nresidual disease after preoperative chem otherapy. Highly selected \npatients with biopsy -proven axillary metastases, who then converted to \nclinically node negative after preoperative systemic therapy, may undergo \nSLNB with removal of the clipped lymph node. This is a currently a \ncategory 2B recomm endation as the rate of false negatives is high when \nSLN is performed after preoperative systemic therapy.  \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, based on available data, the false- negative \nrate can be reduced by marking biopsied lymph nodes to document their \nremoval, using dual tracer, and by removing 3 or more sentinel nodes \n(targeted ALND). When sentinel nodes are not  successfully identified, the \nPanel recommends level I and II axillary dissection be performed for \naxillary staging.  \nRadiation Therapy  \nPrinciples of Radiation Therapy  \nIt is important to individualize RT planning and delivery. CT- based \ntreatment planning is encouraged to delineate target volumes and adjacent organs at risk. Greater target dose homogeneity and sparing of \nnormal tissues can be accomplished using compensators such as \nwedges, forward planning using segments, and intensity -modulated RT \n(IMRT).

Standard utilization of daily imaging is not \nrecommended . Radiation to the breast/chest wall and nodal regions is \ngenerally delivered with single- energy or mixed- energy photons with or \nwithout  electrons.

Radiation- associated cardiac and lung \ndisease were comparable between the groups.  \nOther shorter schedules of delivering WBRT have also been studied with \nsimilar results. The FAST trial compared patients  >50 years of age with \nlow-risk invasive breast carcinoma (pT1–2, pN0) randomly assigned to the \nstandard schedule of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks or 30 Gy or 28.5 \nGy in 5 fractions once  weekly.  After 10- year follow -up, there were no \nsignificant differences reported in normal tissue effects for the standard 50 \nGy in 25 fractions schedule versus a once -weekly schedule for 5 weeks \ntotaling 28.5 Gy, but normal tissue effects were higher with a weekly \nschedule for 5 weeks totaling 30 Gy.175  \nThe FAST Forward trial  r andomized patients with non-metastatic breast \ncancer (n = 4096) after BCS or mastectomy to one of the following: 40 Gy \nin 15 fractions over 3 weeks ; 27 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week ; or 26 Gy in \n5 fractions over 1 week to either whole beast or chest wall.176 The 5-year \nincidence of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse was 2.1% with the standard \n40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks versus 1.7% with 27 Gy in 5 fractions \nover 1 week (5.4 Gy per fraction; HR , 0.86; 95% CI , 0.51–1.44) and 1.4% \nwith 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week (5.2 Gy per fraction; HR , 0.67; 95% \nCI, 0.38–1.16).176 The moderate or marked tissue effects in the breast or \nchest wall were 15% with  27 Gy , 12% with 26 Gy, and 10% with 40 Gy , \nbut differences between the 40  Gy and 26 Gy groups were not statistically \ndifferent.176 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-20 \nRT Boost to Tumor Bed : In patients with higher risk characteristics (such \nas age <50 years, high- grade disease, or patients with focally positive \nmargins) an RT boost has been shown to reduce local \nrelapse.30,32,166,173,177- 179 RT boost treatment in the setting of breast \nconservation can be delivered using enface electrons, photons, or \nbrachytherapy.180 \nNCCN Recommendations for WBRT : The P anel has defined the target as \nbreast tissue at risk. The NCCN Panel recommends a dose of 40 to 42.5 \nGy in 15 to 16 fractions for all patients getting whole breast radiation \nwithout regional nodal radiation, based on its equivalence in efficacy and \ntoxicit y demonstrated in the moderately hypofractionated trials.173 While \nthese abbreviated courses of RT of 40 to 42.5 Gy in 15 to 16 fractions are \nthe NCCN Panel’s preferred fractionation schema for whole breast \nradiation, the conventionally fractionated regimen of 46 to 50 Gy in 23 to \n25 fractions may be utilized in selected patients. The RT boost doses \nintended to decrease rate of local recurrence are 10 to 16 Gy in 4 to 8 \nfractions.  \nUltra -hypofractionated WBRT of 28.5 Gy delivered as 5 (once weekly) \nfractions may be considered in select patients with pTis/T1/T2/N0 aged \n>50 years after BCS, though the optimal fractionation for the boost \ndelivery is unknown for this regimen. Alternatively, 26 Gy in 5 daily \nfractions over one week may be considered, though data beyond 5 years \nfor local relapse or toxicity are not yet available for this regimen and \nshould be discussed with patients prior to its use. The P anel also notes \nthat when using ultra -hypofractionated dosing, it is essential to utilize 3D \nplanning to minimize inhomogeneity and exposure to heart and lung.  \nChest Wall Radiation  \nThe target includes the ipsilateral chest wall, mastectomy scar, and drain \nsites when indicated. Depending on whether the patient has had breast reconstruction, several techniques using photons and/or electrons are \nappropriate. Chest wall scar boost may be delivered with or without bolus \nusing electrons or photons.  \nNCCN Recommendations for Chest Wall Radiation:  The NCCN Panel \nrecommends a dose of 45 to 50.4 Gy in 25 to 28 fractions to the chest \nwall. A boost at the scar of 1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction to a total dose of approximately 60 to 66 Gy may be considered in some cases based on \nrisk. Special consideration should be given to the use of bolus material to \nensure that the skin dose is adequate, particularly in the case of IBC . \nRegional Nodal Irradiation  \nTwo studies, MA.20 and EORTC 22922/10925, evaluated the addition of \nregional nodal irradiation (RNI) to the internal mammary nodes and the \nupper axillary nodes including the supraclavicular region, in addition to \nWBRT or chest wall irradiation after BCS or  mastectomy, respectively. In \nMA.20, regional recurrences were reduced from 2.7% with breast irradiation only to 0.7% with the addition of nodal irradiation.\n181 The distant \nrecurrences were reduced from 17.3% to 13.4%.181 An improvement in \nDFS was seen from 77% to 82% at 10 years in those who received RNI \ncompared to those who did not.181 In EORTC 22922/10925, regional RT \nreduced the incidence of regional recurrences from 4.2% to 2.7% and \ndecreased the rate of distant metastases from 19.6% to 15.9% at a \nmedian follow -up of 10.9 years.182 Results of 15.7 years follow -up showed \nthat breast cancer mortality (19.8% vs. 16%; 95% CI, 0.70– 0.94) and \nbreast cancer recurrence (27.1% vs. 24.5%; 95% CI, 0.77% –0.98%)  were \nreduced with internal mammary and medial supraclavicular RT.183 \nThe independent contribution of internal mammary nodal RT as a \ncomponent of RNI continues to be debated as it is associated with higher \nrisk of cardiac and lung toxicity, and data regarding its benefits are \nconflicting (discussed in detail below).

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-21 \nNCCN Recommendation for RNI : When considering RNI, anatomic \nvariations across patients result in significant differences in prescription \ndepth and field design. The NCCN Panel therefore recommends  contouring the individual nodal basins that are at  risk using \none of the various  breast atlases, to ensure adequate RT coverage.  \n184,185  \nThe recommended dose for RNI is 45 to 50.4 Gy in 25 to 28 fractions to \nthe regional nodal fields.  A supplemental  RT boost can be delivered to \ngrossly involved or enlarged lymph nodes (ie, internal mammary or \nclavicular) that have not been surgically addressed.  \nAccelerated Partial Breast Irradiation  \nSeveral large, randomized trials have been published using various forms of APBI rather than WBRT  after BCS. Most of these studies have found \nthat rates of local control in selected  patients , with early -stage breast \ncancer  and low risk of recurrence,  are equal to those  treated with \nWBR T.\n44,46,186- 188 In the NSABP B- 39 trial, 10 -year cumulative incidence of \nIBTR with APBI was 4.6% compared with 3. 9% with WBRT , yielding an \nabsolute difference of 0.7% with an HR of 1.22 (90% CI, 0.94– 1.58) that \ndid not meet the prespecified criteria for equivalence.43 However, given the \nsmall magnitude in IBTR differences between WBRT and APBI, it is not \nlikely to be of clinical significance in appropriately selected patients.  \nQOL, toxicity, and cosmetic outcomes have generally been comparable or slightly favored APBI in randomized trials. For example, the IMPORT- LOW \nstudy compared WBRT with partial breast irradiation delivered as 40 Gy in 15 once- daily fractions using reduced -size breast tangents and found less \nbreast firmness, less change in breast appearance, and lower average number of adverse events per person with partial breast irradiation.\n186,189 \nThe University of Florence compared WBRT with intensity -modulated \nAPBI (30 Gy in 5 fractions, delivered every other day), and 10 -year results \nhave shown that APBI produced less acute and late toxicity and better cosmetic outcomes.\n187 However, the RAPID trial found significantly higher rates of fair/poor cosmetic outcome with 3D conformal APBI delivered as \n38.5 Gy in 10 twice- daily fractions .44,190 The majority of APBI patients on \nNSABP B- 39 were treated with the same external beam regimen , and  \ntreatment -related toxicities were not different for APBI v ersus WBRT as \ncurrently reported.43 Cosmetic outcome analysis , however, is pending.   \nNCCN Recommendation for APBI:  The Panel accepts the updated \nASTRO APBI consensus statement  for guidance on APBI use .191 The \nNCCN Panel recommends APBI for any BRCA -negative patient who \nmeets the ASTRO 2016 “suitable” criteria defined as  age >50 years, ER -\npositive invasive ductal carcinoma measuring ≤2 cm (pT1 disease) with \nnegative margin widths of  ≥2 mm, and no lymphovascular invasion ( LVI), \nand also permits APBI in patients > 50 years of age with screen- detected \nlow- or intermediate- grade DCIS measuring ≤2.5 cm, resected with ≥3 mm \nmargins. The Panel prefer s the APBI regimen and method followed in the \ntrial by University o f Florence (30 Gy/5 fractions every other day  delivered \nusing IMRT).187 The Panel encourages participation in clinical trials for \npatients who do not meet the above criteria.  \nAdjuvant Radiation Therapy A fter BCS  \nThose who have a positive lymph node have a high risk of recurrence. \nTherefore, after BCS WBRT is strongly recommended with or without \nboost to tumor bed for node- positive disease (category 1 for those with \npositive nodes;  category 2A for those with negative axillary nodes). This \nrecommendation is supported by the results of a meta -analysis by the \nEBCTCG showing reduction in 10- year risk of recurrence in those who \nreceived WBRT  versus those who did not (19% vs. 35%; RR, 0.52; 95% \nCI 0.48– 0.56) .117 In addition, a significant reduction in 15- year risk of \nbreast cancer death (21% vs. 25%; RR , 0.82; 95% CI , 0.75–0.90)  was \nalso observed .117 \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-22 \nFor patients with a pathologically confirmed, focally positive margin without \nEIC, who do not undergo re- excision after BCS, the use of a higher \nradiation boost dose to the tumor bed may be considered, since generally \na boost to the tumor bed is recommended for patients at higher risk of \nrecurrence.  \nRegional Nodal Irradiation After BCS \nThe reduction in t he risk of locoregional and distant recurrence and \nimprovement in DFS  seen in the MA.20 and EORTC 22922/10925 \ntrials,181,182 and the reduction in breast cancer mortality with 15- year follow -\nup of the EORTC 22922 patients,183 support the importance of RNI  after \nBCS.  \nAs mentioned previously, routine inclusion of the internal mammary nodes \nas a component of RNI r emains somewhat controversial  due to the \nassociated cardiac and lung toxicities. A Korean trial KROG 08- 06 studied \nindependent effect on DFS of RT to internal mammary nodes after BCS or \nmastectomy for node- positive disease,192 randomizing patients to RNI with \ninternal mammary RT versus RNI without internal mammary RT. Radiation \nto the internal mammary nodes did not significantly improve the DFS in \npatients with node- positive breast cancer. However, there was a \nstatistically significant  benefit in outcomes  with internal mammary nodal \nRT for patients with medially or centrally located tumors.192 Conflicting \ndata have arisen from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group that \nrecently reported 15- year follow -up of their study on RT to internal \nmammary nodes in patients (n = 3089) with positive nodes and early -\nstage breast cancer.193 In this study, RT to the internal mammary nodes \nwas delivered to r ight-sided patients (n = 1,491) , while no RT to internal \nmammary nodes was delivered to left -sided patients (n = 1,598) . The \nstudy reported a 15-year improved OS rate of 60.1% with RT to internal \nmammary nodes compared to 55.4%  with no RT to internal mammary \nnodes. Improvements were also seen with respect to risk of developing distant recurrence  and breast cancer -specific mortality  favoring RT to \ninternal mammary nodes.193 \nClinical judgment is needed when determining inclusion of the internal \nmammary nodes during  RNI. Therefore, the NCCN Panel no longer \nspecifies the fields that should be included for RNI and refers to it as \ncomprehensive RNI. According to the P anel, patient selection should \nconsider risks v ersus  benefits including long-term organ ( cardiac and lung)  \ntoxicities , comorbidities of the patient , age, and life expectancy . In \nincluding RT to the internal mammary nodes, m eticulous treatment \nplanning with normal tissue dose constraints is mandatory .  \nRNI After BCS for Node-Negative Disease: T he NCCN P anel \nrecommends consideration of comprehensive RNI in patients  with \ncentral/medial tumors (in accordance with EORTC 22922 trial criteria) and \nin accordance with the MA.20 criteria: 3 tumors, as well as those with T2 \ntumors who have undergone limited axillary dissection (<10 lymph nodes) and also have other risk factors, including high- grade histology, ER -\nnegative disease, or LVI .\n181 \nRNI After BCS for Node-Positive Disease: For those with 1 to 3 positive \nnodes, if a patient meets all of the following criteria—has cT1– T2, cN0 ; did \nnot receive preoperative chemotherapy ; and has 1 to 2 positive SLNs —the \nuse of comprehensive RNI with or without the intentional inclusion of the \naxilla is at the discretion of the radiation oncologist. If the patients do not \nmeet all the criteria listed, the NCCN Panel recommends WBRT with \ninclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk (category 1)  with \nstrong consideration of comprehensive RNI.  \nFor those with  4 or more positive nodes, the NCCN Panel recommends \ncomprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla \nat risk (category 1) .

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-23 \nRadiation Therapy After BCS  in Older Adults  with ER -Positive Tumors  \nWBRT  as a component of BCT  does not affect breast cancer -specific \nsurvival in selected patients  >70 years of age with more indolent disease. \nIn a study of patients  with clinical stage I, ER- positive breast cancer who \nwere ≥70 years of age at diagnosis, patients were randomized to receive \nBCS with WBRT  or BCS alone, both with tamoxifen for 5  years. \nLocoregional recurrence rates were 1% in the BCS , radiation, and \ntamoxifen arm and 4% in the BCS  plus tamoxifen arm. There were no \ndifferences in OS, DFS, or need  for mastectomy.194 These results were \nconfirmed in an updated analysis of this study with a median follow -up of \n12.6 years.195 At 10 years, a statistically significant reduction in IBTR was \nseen with RT  with 90% of patients in the BCS  and tamoxifen arm \ncompared with 98% in the BCS  plus radiation and tamoxifen arm .195 \nConcordant results have been demonstrated in other studies of similar \ndesign.196,197 Whether the increase in local relapse without RT is relevant \nfor an individual patient should be individualized after a discussion of the \nrisks and benefits of RT and patient commitment to 5 years of endocrine \ntherapy if RT omission is being considered.  \nThe NCCN Guidelines allow for the use of BCS  (pathologically negative \nmargin required) with 5 years of tamoxifen or an AI, without breast \nirradiation,  for patients  >70 years with clinically negative lymph nodes and \nER-positive , T1 breast cancer s (category 1) .  \nAdjuvant Radiation Therapy A fter Mastectomy \nPost-Mastectomy RT for Node -Positiv e Disease  \nRandomized clinical trials have shown that a DFS and OS advantage is \nconferred by the irradiation of chest wall and regional lymph nodes in \npatients  with positive ALNs after mastectomy and ALN D.198- 202 In these \ntrials, the ipsilateral chest wall and the ipsilateral locoregional lymph nodes \nwere irradiated. The results of EBCTCG meta- analyses show  that RT after \nmastectomy and axillary node dissection reduced both recurrence and breast cancer mortality in the patients  with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes \neven when systemic therapy was administered.182,203 According to the \nNCCN Panel, post -mastectomy radiation to the chest wall is \nrecommended in all of these patients ( category 1).  Data from the EORTC \n22922/10925 trial support  the inclusion of RNI in patients undergoing post -\nmastectomy radiation. The trial assessed the independent effects of \nincluding RNI versus no RNI when treating the chest wall after \nmastectomy. Based on the benefits demonstrated in this trial , the NCCN \nPanel recommends comprehensive RNI to include any undissected axilla \nat risk (category 1 for 1 or more positive nodes).   \n \nPost-Mastectomy RT for Node -Negative Disease:  \nIn patients with negative nodes, tumor ≤5 cm, and clear margins (≥1 mm), \npost-mastectomy RT (PMRT) is typically not recommended. However, the \nPanel has noted that it may be considered in subsets of these patients \nwith high -risk features. Based on the inclusion criteria of node- negative \npatients enrolled onto the RNI trials (MA -20 and EORTC 22922), any \npatients with the following high- risk features, including central/medial \ntumors, T3 tumors, or tumors ≥ 2 cm with < 10 axillary nodes removed and \nat least one of the following: grade 3, ER -negative, or LVI, should be \nconsidered for PMRT with RNI to include any undissected axilla at risk.  \nFeatures in node- negative tumors that predict a high rate of local \nrecurrence include primary tumors > 5 cm or positive pathologic \nmargins.204  \nIn patients with positive pathologic margin, if re-resection to negative \nmargins is not possible, the P anel recommends strongly considering chest \nwall irradiation with the addition of comprehensive RNI including any portion of the axilla at risk. Chest wall irradiation should be considered with \naddition of comprehensive RNI , including any portion of the axilla at risk in \nthose with tumors >5 cm. In patients with tumors ≤5 cm and negative \nmargins ≤1 mm, chest wall irradiation should be considered with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

Data from numerous studies in patients with stage III disease \nsuggest that postoperative RT improves local control even for patients \nwho have a pathologic complete response  (pCR) to neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy.205- 208 \nRT After Preoperative Therapy and  BCS: \nThose who have clinically negative nodes at diagnosis, that remain \npathologically node- negative at definitive surgery (after systemic therapy), \nshould receive adjuvant RT to the whole breast with the addition of boost \nto the tumor bed after SLNB . \nPatients who have clinically/radiographically positive nodes at diagnosis \nand convert to clinically/radiographically node- negative after preoperative \nchemotherapy are candidates for the NSABP B -51 trial assessing the \nbenefit of RNI. Until the results of this trial become available, the existing data suggest that node -positive disease at presentation is  at high risk for \nlocoregional recurrence  and should be considered to receive \ncomprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla \nat ris k. \nPatients who have clinically/radiographically positive nodes at diagnosis \nwho convert to clinically/radiographically negative nodes after preoperative chemotherapy, but are found to have persistent nodal disease on SLNB, are candidates for the ALLIANCE 11202 trial assessing whether ALND \ncan be safely replaced with axillary RT. ALND is the standard arm of this \ntrial; however, in the event that a neoadjuvant therapy patient with node -\npositive disease (ypN1+) does not undergo a complete axillary dissection, all levels of the undissected axilla should be included with the radiation \ntreatment.  \nRT After Preoperative Therapy and  Mastectomy:  \nThose who have clinically positive nodes at diagnosis that respond to \npreoperative systemic therapy and become node -negative should be \nstrongly considered to receive RT to the chest wall and comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla at risk based on \nthe discussion above. \n \nFor those with positive nodes (ypN1+) after preoperative systemic therapy , \naxillary dissection is the standard treatment arm  of the ongoing Alliance \n11202 trial; however, if RT is indicated it should include chest wall along \nwith comprehensive RNI with inclusion of any portion of the undissected \naxilla at risk.  \nThose who have node- negative disease at diagnosis and after \npreoperative systemic therapy and whose axilla was assessed by SLNB or \naxillary node dissection may forego RT.  \nTwo prospective trials are ongoing and will prospectively evaluate the benefit of RT in patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy (NSABP B -\n51/RTOG 1304  [NCT01872975] and the Alliance A011202/MAC19 trial \n[NCT01901094] ). \nSequencing of RT and Systemic Therapy   PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-25 \nIf chemotherapy  and radiation are  indicated after surgery , adjuvant \nradiation is typically delivered after the completion of chemotherapy.209,210 \nThis recommendation is based on results of the “Upfront -Outback” trial in \nwhich patients who had undergone BCS  and axillary dissection were \nrandomly assigned to receive chemotherapy following RT or RT following \nchemotherapy. The initial results showed an increased rate of local \nrecurrence in the group with delayed RT at a median follow -up of 58 \nmonths;210 however, differences in rates of distant or local recurrence were \nnot statistically significant when the two arms were compared at \n135-month follow -up.209 While it is  common for RT to follow chemotherapy \nwhen chemotherapy is indicated,  based on data from prospective and \nretrospective studies, CMF (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil) \nand RT may be given concurrently .  \nData from m ultiple studies of patients treated with endocrine therapy either  \nbefore, during, or after RT suggest no difference in outcomes or \ntoxicity .211-214 Therefore, according to the NCCN Panel, sequential or \nconcurrent endocrine therapy with RT is acceptable. However, due to \ncompounding side effects, initiating endocrine therapy at the completion of \nRT may be preferred.  \nWhen adjuvant c apecitabine215 is indicated, sinc e it is a known \nradiosensitizing agent with potential to increase toxicity to normal tissue, it \nshould be given after completion of adjuvant RT.  \nWhen adjuvant olaparib is used, the P anel recommends that olaparib be \ngiven after completion of RT.  In the OlympiA trial,216 olaparib was not \nadministered concurrently with RT and there are limited data on safety of \nconcurrent administration.  \nAdjuvant HER2- targeted therapy may be delivered concurrently with RT. \nData from clinical trials in the adjuvant setting do  not suggest  an increased complication rate with the concurrent administration of  HER2 -targeted \ntherapies  with adjuvant RT.217  \n \n \n \n  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-26 \nBreast Reconstruction  \nBreast reconstruction may be an option for any one r eceiving surgical \ntreatment for breast cancer. Therefore, all patients undergoing breast \ncancer treatment should be educated about breast reconstructive options \nas adapted to their individual clinical situation and be offered an \nopportunity to consult with a reconstructive plastic surgeon. Breast \nreconstruction should not interfere with the appropriate surgical \nmanagement. This may increase the risk of overall and cancer -related \ndeath,  especially in those with late -stage disease.218 Coordinating \nconsultation and surgical treatment with a reconstructive surgeon should \nbe executed within a reasonable timeframe.  \nSeveral reconstructive approaches are summarized for these patients in \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer  under Principles of Breast \nReconstruction Following Surgery . \nThe decision regarding type of reconstruction includes patient preference, \nbody habitus, smoking history, comorbidities, plans for irradiation, and \nexpertise and experience of the reconstruction team. Smoking and obesity \nincrease the risk of complications for all types of breast reconstruction \nwhether with implant or flap.219- 223 Smoking and obesity are therefore \nconsidered a relative contraindication to breast reconstruction by the \nNCCN Panel. Patients should be informed of increased rates of wound \nhealing complications and partial or complete flap failure among patients \nwho smoke  and have obesity . \nReconstruction is an optional procedure that does not impact the probability of recurrence or death, but it is associated with an improved \nQOL  for many patients. It is sometimes necessary to perform surgery on \nthe contralateral breast (ie, breast reduction, implantation) to achieve optimal symmetry between the ipsilateral reconstructed breast and the \ncontralateral breast.   Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy \nMastectomy results in loss of the breast for breastfeeding, loss of \nsensation in the skin of the breast and nipple- areolar complex (NAC), and \nloss of the breast for cosmetic, body image, and psychosocial purposes. The loss of the breast for cosmetic, body image, and psychosocial issues \nmay be partially overcome through the performance of breast \nreconstruction with or without reconstruction of the NAC.   \nThose undergoing mastectomy should be offered consultation regarding \noptions and timing of breast reconstruction.   \nMany factors must be considered in the decision- making about breast \nreconstruction. There are several different types of breast reconstruction \nthat include the use of implants, autogenous tissues, or both.\n224-226 \nReconstruction with implants can be performed either by immediate \nplacement of a permanent subpectoral implant or initial placement of a \nsubpectoral expander implant followed by gradual expansion of the \nimplant envelope with stretching of the pectoralis m ajor muscle and \noverlying skin followed by replacement of the expander with a permanent implant. A wide variety of implants are available that contain saline, \nsilicone gel, or a combination of saline and silicone gel inside a solid \nsilicone envelope.  \nAutogenous tissue methods of reconstruction use various combinations of \nfat, muscle, skin, and vasculature from donor sites (ie, abdomen, buttock, \nback) that may be brought to the chest wall with their original blood supply \n(pedicle flap) or as free flaps with microvascular anastomoses to supply \nblood from the chest wall/thorax.\n227 Several procedures using autologous \ntissue are available including transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap, latissimus dorsi flap, and gluteus maximus myocutaneous flap \nreconstruction.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-27 \nComposite reconstruction techniques use implants in combination with \nautogenous tissue reconstruction to provide volume and symmetry. \nPatients with underlying diabetes or who smoke tobacco have increased \nrates of complications following autogenous tissue breast cancer \nreconstruction, presumably because of underlying microvascular disease.  \nReconstruction can be performed either at the time of the mastectomy \nknown as “immediate breast reconstruction” and under the same \nanesthetic or in a delayed fashion any time, known as “delayed breast \nreconstruction.” In many cases, breast reconstruction i nvolves a staged \napproach requiring more than one procedure such as surgery on the contralateral breast to improve symmetry, revision surgery involving the \nbreast and/or donor site, and/or nipple and areola reconstruction and \ntattoo pigmentation.  \nPlans for post -mastectomy RT can impact decisions related to breast \nreconstruction since there is a significantly increased risk of implant \ncapsular contracture following irradiation of an implant. Furthermore, post -\nmastectomy irradiation may have a negative impact on breast cosmesis when autologous tissue is used in immediate breast reconstruction, and \nmay interfere with the targeted delivery of radiation when immediate \nreconstruction is performed using either autologous tissue or breast \nimplants.\n228,229 Some studies, however, have not found a significant \ncompromise in reconstruction cosmesis after RT .230 The preferred \napproach to breast reconstruction for irradiated patients was a subject of \ncontroversy among the P anel. While some experienced breast cancer \nteams have employed protocols in which immediate tissue reconstructions are followed by RT, generally RT  is preferred to precede autologous \nreconstruction due to the reported loss in reconstruction cosmesis (category 2B). When implant reconstruction is planned in a post -\nmastectomy patient requiring RT , the NCCN Panel prefers a staged \napproach with immedi ate tissue expander placement followed by implant placement. Immediate placement of an implant in patients requiring \npostoperative radiation has an increased rate of capsular contracture, \nmalposition, poor cosmesis, and implant exposure. Surgery to exchange \nthe tissue expanders with permanent implants can be performed prior to \nradiation or after completion of RT .   \nIn a previously radiated patient, the use of tissue expanders/implants is \nrelatively contraindicated.\n231 Tissue expansion of irradiated skin can result \nin a significantly increased risk of capsular contracture, malposition, poor cosmesis, implant exposure, and failed reconstruction.\n232,233 If a patient \nhas previously received RT to the breast, autologous tissue reconstruction \nis the preferred method of breast reconstruction.  \nSkin -Sparing Mastectomy \nSkin-sparing mastectomy procedures are appropriate for some patients \nand involve removal of the breast parenchyma including the NAC while \npreserving the majority of the original skin envelope, and are followed by \nimmediate reconstruction with autogenous ti ssue, a prosthetic implant, or \na composite of autogenous tissue and an implant. Skin- sparing \nmastectomy involving preservation of the skin of the NAC has become the \nsubject of increased attention. Possible advantages of this procedure \ninclude improvements in breast cosmesis, body image, and nipple \nsensation following mastectomy, although the impact of this procedure on \nthese QOL  issues has not been well -studied.234-236 There are limited data \nfrom surgical series, with short follow -up, that suggest that performance of \nNAC- sparing mastectomy in selected patients is associated with low rates \nof occult involvement of the NAC with breast cancer and local disease \nrecurrence.235,237,238 NAC -sparing procedures may be an option in patients \nwho are carefully selected by experienced multidisciplinary teams. \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, when considering a NAC -sparing \nprocedure, assessment of nipple margins is mandatory.

Several prospective trials \nare underway to evaluate NAC -sparing mastectomy in the setting of \ncancer and enrollment in such trials is encouraged.   \nAdvantages of a skin- sparing mastectomy procedure include an improved \ncosmetic outcome resulting in a reduction in the size of the mastectomy \nscar and a more natural breast shape, especially when autologous tissue \nis used in reconstruction,241 and the ability to perform immediate \nreconstruction. Although no randomized studies have been performed, \nresults of several mostly retrospective studies have indicated that the risk \nof local recurrence is not increased when patients receiving skin- sparing \nmastectomies are compared with those undergoing non- skin–sparing \nprocedures. However, strong selection biases almost certainly exist in the \nidentification of patients appropriate for skin- sparing procedures.242-246 \nReconstruction of the NAC may also be performed in a delayed fashion if desired by the patient. Reconstructed nipples are devoid of sensation. \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, skin- sparing mastectomy should be \nperformed by an experienced breast surgery team t hat works in a \ncoordinated, multidisciplinary fashion to guide proper patient selection for \nskin-sparing mastectomy, determine optimal sequencing of the \nreconstructive procedure(s) in relation to adjuvant therapies, and perform \na resection that achieves appropriate surgical margins. Post -mastectomy \nradiation should still be applied for patients treated by skin- sparing \nmastectomy following the same selection criteria as for standard \nmastectomy.  Breast Reconstruction After Lumpectomy  \nIssues related to breast reconstruction also pertain to those who undergo \nor have undergone a lumpectomy, particularly in situations where the \nsurgical defect is large and/or expected to be cosmetically unsatisfactory. \nAn evaluation of the likely cosmetic outcome of lumpectomy should be \nperformed prior to surgery. Oncoplastic techniques for breast conservation \ncan extend breast -conserving surgical options in situations where the \nresection by itself would likely yield an unacceptable cosmetic outcome.\n247 \nThe evolving field of oncoplastic surgery includes the use of “volume \ndisplacement” techniques performed in conjunction with a large partial \nmastectomy.248 Oncoplastic volume displacement procedures combine the \nremoval of generous regions of breast tissue (typically designed to \nconform to the segmentally distributed cancer in the breast) with \n“mastopexy” techniques in which remaining breast tissues are shift ed \ntogether within the breast envelope to fill the resulting surgical defect and thereby avoid the creation of significant breast deformity. Volume \ndisplacement techniques are generally performed during the same \noperative setting as the breast -conserving l umpectomy by the same \nsurgeon who is performing the cancer resection.\n248,249 \nAdvantages of oncoplastic volume displacement techniques are that they permit the removal of larger regions of breast tissue, thereby achieving \nwider surgical margins around the cancer, and at the same time better \npreserve the natural shape and appearance of the breast than do standard \nbreast resections.\n250  \nLimitations of oncoplastic volume displacement techniques include lack of standardization among centers, performance at only a limited number of \nsites in the United States, and the possible necessity for subsequent \nmastectomy if pathologic margins are posi tive when further \nbreast -conserving attempts are deemed impractical or unrealistic. \nNevertheless, the Panel consensus is that these issues should be PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-30 \nSystemic Therapies (Preoperative and Adjuvant)   \n  \n \nPreoperative Systemic Therapy \nThe NCCN Panel has outlined the rationale, appropriate patient selection, \nand response assessment for preoperative systemic therapy in a new \nsection titled, Principles of Preoperative Chemotherapy . \nRandomized clinical trials have found no significant differences in \nlong- term outcomes when systemic chemotherapy is given before or after \nsurgery.251,252 Historically, a primary advantage of administering \npreoperative systemic therapy has been to improve surgical outcomes. \nPreoperative systemic therapy can convert  inoperable tumors to operable \nand also downstage a significant number of  patients with operable breast \ncancer to allow for more limited breast conservation procedures. 253 \nResults from large clinical trials and retrospective reviews indicate that \nbreast conservation rates are improved with preoperative systemic \ntherapy.252,254 Clinicians need to carefully consider the extent of disease in \nthe breast , tumor biology  and likelihood of adequate tumor response \nbefore recommending preoperative systemic therapy to improve the \nlikelihood of successful breast conservation.   \n \nIn addition, use of preoperative systemic therapy may provide important \nprognostic information based on response to therapy. Achieving a \npathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy is associated \nwith favorable disease- free and OS in early -stage breast cancer.  The \ncorrelation between pathologic response and long -term outcomes in \npatients with early -stage breast cancer is strongest for patients with \ntriple -negative breast cancer, less so for HER2- positive disease, and least \nfor hormone- positive disease.255-257  \n  Other benefits of preoperative systemic therapy include allowing time for \nappropriate genetic testing and for planning potential breast reconstruction \nin patients proceeding with mastectomy. For those with significant residual disease after standard preoperative systemic therapy, it may provide an \nopportunity to identify patients who  may benefit from further adjuvant \ntherapy after surgery . It many allow sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) \nalone or allow for limited radiation fields if clinically node positive disease \nbecomes clinically node negative after preoperative systemic therapy . In \naddition, preoperative systemic therapy also serves as an excellent \nresearch platform to test novel therapies and predictive biomarkers by \nproviding tumor specimens and blood samples prior to and during \nsystemic treatment.  \nSelection of Patients for Preoperative Therapy  \nNot all patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative systemic \ntherapy. According to the NCCN Panel, among those with inoperable \nbreast tumors, preoperative systemic therapy is indicated in patients  with \nlocally advanced or inoperable breast cancer including those with inflammatory breast cancer; those with bulky or matted c N2 axillary nodes; \ncN3 regional lymph node nodal disease; and cT4 tumors.  \nIn patients with operable tumors, preoperative systemic therapy is the \npreferred approach for the following scenarios: for patients with TNBC and \nHER2+ breast cancer that is clinical stage T2N0 and higher or is clinically \nnode positive; if the patient’s br east cancer subtype is associated with a \nhigh likelihood of response; or if a patient desires BCS and the size of the tumor is large relative to that of the breast.  \nWhen preoperative systemic therapy is used to improve the likelihood of \nsuccessful breast conservation, the surgical plan should consider the \npossibility that clear surgical margins may not always be obtained, and a \nfollow- up mastectomy may be required, with or without breast \nreconstruction. This consideration is especially important when oncoplastic This section for systemic therapies (preoperative and adjuvant) was  updated  on \nJune 7th, 2024.

Preoperative systemic therapy should not \nbe offered in patients with extensive in situ disease when the extent of \ninvasive disease cannot be defined; in pat ients where the extent of the \ntumor is poorly delineated; or in those whose tumors are not clinically assessable. The decision to utilize preoperative therapy should be made \nin the context of a coordinated and collaborative multi -disciplinary team.  \nFor predicting the response of pre -operative endocrine therapy for \npostmenopausal women with ER -positive , HER2 -negative, cN0 breast  \ncancer, data from the TransNEOS study  demonstrate a significant \ncorrelation between 21 gene assay Recurrence Score and clinical \nresponse to preoperative  letrozole .  Those whose tumors had a \nRecurrence Score between 0-17 were significantly more likely to respond \nto preoperative letrozole compared with Recurrence Score  of 31-100.\n258 \nFor predicting the response to pre -operative chemotherapy for post -\nmenopausal, ER-positive, HER2 -negative patients with T1/T2, node \nnegative tumors , another study evaluated the role of the Recurrence \nScore  with pathologic response rates after pre -operative systemic therapy.  \nTheir findings suggest hi gh Recurrence Scores are associated with a \nhigher likelihood of pCR after preoperative chemotherapy.259 \nBased on the above two studies  that showed the use of 21- gene \nRecurrence Score in predicting response to preoperative chemotherapy , \n258,259 the NCCN panel has added a footnote for considering the use of a \ngene expression assay  during workup  when contemplating preoperative \nendocrine or systemic therapy for postmenopausal patients with cN0, operable ER -positive, HER2 -negative disease , to aid in predicting \nresponse to preoperative therapy .  \nPreoperative therapy options:  \nChemotherapy : A number of chemotherapy regimens have activity in the \npreoperative setting. According to the NCCN Panel, those regimens recommended in the adjuvant setting may be considered in the \npreoperative setting. In both settings, the underlying aim remains the \nsame: eradication or control of undiscovered distant metastases.  \n \nEndocrine Therapy : Preoperative endocrine therapy alone may be offered \nto those with strongly HR -positive tumors  based on comorbidities or low -\nrisk luminal biology based on clinical characteristics and/or genomic \nsignatures (until desired effect is achieved).\n260- 267 The results of the \nACOSOG Z1031 trial s how that preoperative endocrine therapy is \neffective in reducing residual disease and enabling BCS  for many patients \nwith low rates of local -regional recurrence post -surgery . 268  \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, the endocrine therapy options include an \naromatase inhibitor (with ovarian function suppression (OFS) for \npremenopausal patients ) or tamoxifen  (with or without OFS  for \npremenopausal patients ). The preferred endocrine therapy option for \npostmenopausal patients  is an aromatase inhibitor. The panel has added \na comment that the optimal response to endocrine therapy, if achieved is \nanywhere between 4- 6 months based on the above trials.  \nHER2 -Targeted Therapy: For patients with HER2 -positive breast cancer, \nthat are candidates for preoperative systemic therapy, chemotherapy and \ntrastuzumab- based therapy is recommended.269 Chemotherapy and dual \nanti-HER2 blockade associated with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab has \nshown significant improvements in the pCR rate when compared with chemotherapy and trastuzumab in the preoperative setting.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-32 \nIn the TRYPHAENA trial, preoperative therapy with pertuzumab and \ntrastuzumab given along with anthracycline- containing or \nanthracycline- free standard chemotherapy regimens to patients with \noperable, locally advanced, or inflammatory HER2- positive breast cancer \nshowed pCR rates in all treatment arms ranging from 57% to 66%.270 In \nthe Neosphere trial, the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and \ndocetaxel preoperatively led to a statistically significant increase in pCR in the breast which in turn led to improves outcomes in those with node-\npositive disease.\n271,272 The NCCN Panel supports the FDA -approved \nindication that a pertuzumab- containing regimen may be administered \npreoperatively to patients with greater than or equal to cT2, or greater than \nor equal to cN1, HER2- positive, early -stage breast cancer.  \nImmunotherapy:  The r andomized phase III multicenter, double- blind, \nplacebo- controlled trial (KEYNOTE- 522) compared  preoperative \ncarboplatin and paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide in combination with either pembrolizumab ( n=784) or \nplacebo ( n=390), followed by pembrolizumab or placebo administered \nevery 3 weeks for up to nine cycles after surgery, in patients with \npreviously untreated stage II -III TNBC.\n273 After a median follow -up of 39.1 \nmonths, a significant improvement in event -free survival was seen with the \naddition of pembrolizumab compared with placebo plus chemotherapy . \nThe 3-year event -free survival rates were  84.5% and 76.8%, respectively \n(HR = 0.63, 95% CI  = 0.48 –0.82;  P < .001).273 \nThe 5- year follow -up of KEYNOTE -522 trial results showed an \nimprovement in EFS rate in patients treated with chemotherapy plus \npembrolizumab  compared with the placebo arm (81.3% vs . 72.3%), with \nreduction in risk for recurrence, progression, complications, or death of 37% (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49- 0.81).\n274 Among patients in the trial who had \na pCR and received adjuvant pembrolizumab, the 5-year EFS rate  was \n92.2% compared with 88.2% in patients who received only chemotherapy .274 There are no data comparing adjuvant pembrolizumab \nwith other newer adjuvant therapies such as adjuvant capecitabine and/or olaparib in patients who meet criteria for treatment with one or more of \nthese agents.   \nResponse Assessment During Preoperative Chemotherapy  \nThe NCCN panel recommends that tumor response should be routinely \nassessed by clinical exam during the delivery of preoperative systemic \ntherapy. Patients with operable breast cancer experiencing progression of \ndisease while undergoing preoperative systemic therapy should be taken \npromptly to surgery.  Imaging during preoperative systemic therapy should \nnot be done routinely but may be considered if tumor progression is suspected. Imaging prior to surgery should be determined by a  \nmulti- disciplinary  team.  \nIn a multicenter analysis of patients (n=5161), the r esidual cancer burden \n(RCB) after preoperative chemotherapy was seen to be prognostic within \neach breast cancer subtype.\n275 Higher RCB scores were significantly \nassociated with worse event -free survival, with hazard ratios ranging from \n1.55 to 2.16 across different breast cancer subtypes . \nThis study highlights RCB as a pr ognostic  factor for outcomes in patients \nwith breast cancer patients undergoing preoperative chemotherapy.275 \nAs noted under the “workup” section, in order to have a standardized \nmethod of pathology reporting, the NCCN endorses the CAP protocol for \npathology reporting for all invasive and noninvasive carcinomas of the breast.  On the Principles of Preoperative Therapy page, the panel  \nencourages that the pathology report from definitive surgery after \npreoperative systemic therapy include the standardized tissue sampling \nand reporting elements of the Residual Cancer Burden (RCB).

In patients with early -stage breast cancer, systemic adjuvant therapy is \nadministered to reduce risk of cancer recurrence. The decision is often \nbased on individual risk of relapse and predicted sensitivity to a particular \ntreatment (eg, ER/PR and HER2 status). The decision to use systemic \nadjuvant therapy requires considering and balancing risk for disease \nrecurrence with loc al therapy alone, the magnitude of benefit from \napplying adjuvant therapy, toxicity of the therapy, and comorbidity. The \ndecision- making process requires collaboration between the health care \nteam and patient.  \n \nStratification for Systemic Adjuvant Therapy  \nThe NCCN Guidelines stratify , patients with breast cancer based on their \nHR- status and HER2 expression. Patients are then further stratified \nbased on risk of disease recurrence based on anatomic and pathologic \ncharacteristics (ie, tumor grade, tumor size, ALN status, angiolymphatic \ninvasion).  \nAdjuvant Systemic therapy for HR -positive, HER2- negative tumors  \nPatients with HR positive, HER2 -negative tumors , receive adjuvant \nendocrine therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence and those deemed at \nhigh risk for distant recurrence despite adjuvant endocrine therapy, \nreceive adjuvant chemotherapy . The NCCN Guidelines call for the \ndetermination of ER  and PR content in all primary invasive breast \ncancers\n276 to determine whether a patient is a candidate for endocrine \ntherapies.  Patients with cancers with 1% –100% ER IHC staining are considered ER+ and eligible for endocrine therapies. Given the limited \nefficacy data on the ER -low-positive (1% -10%) group, with ER -low-positive \npatients reported to be a heterogeneous group with a natural \nhistory/biologic behavior often similar to ER -negative cancers,  \nindividualized consideration of risks versus benefits of endocrine therapy \nand additional adjuvant therapies shoul d be incorporated into decision-\nmaking. Patients with ER -negative, PR -positive cancers may also be \nconsidered for endocrine therapies, however, the efficacy data on this \ngroup are also limited. The same overall interpretation principles apply but \nPR should be interpreted as either positive (if 1% –100% of cells have \nnuclear staining) or negative (if <1% or 0% of cells have nuclear staining). For the purposes of this guideline, any ER and/or PR -positive tumors is \nreferred  to as ‘hormone receptor (HR) -positive ’, given that the majority of \nall breast cancers are ER -positive or ER and PR -positive and the \nsubgroup of ER negative/ PR-positive tumors are relatively uncommon.  \nThe magnitude of risk reduction from adjuvant endocrine therapy is \ndependent on level of ER -expression and on recurrence score (RS) of \ngene expression assay test results. Low level of ER expression is less \nlikely to benefit from endocrine therapy and a high RS will gain less benefit \nwith endocrine therapy  alone versus those with low RS.  \nPatients with invasive breast cancers that are HR - positive should be \nconsidered for adjuvant endocrine therapy regardless of patient age, \nlymph node status, or whether adjuvant chemotherapy is to be \nadministered.\n277 Selected studies suggest that HER2- positive breast \ncancers may be less sensitive to some endocrine therapies, although \nother studies have failed to confirm this finding.278-286 A retrospective \nanalysis of tumor blocks collected in the ATAC t rial indicated that HER2 \namplification is a marker of relative endocrine resistance independent of \ntype of endocrine therapy.287 However, given the favorable toxicity profile \nof the available endocrine therapies, the p anel recommends the use of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

The outcome analyses of \n6846 patients  with ER- positive disease showed that by extending adjuvant \ntreatment to 10 years, the risk of relapse and breast cancer -related \nmortality was reduced.291 The risk of recurrence during years 5 to 14 was \n21.4% for patients  receiving tamoxifen versus 25.1% for controls (absolute \nrecurrence reduction 3.7%). Patients who received tamoxifen for 10 years \nhad a greater reduction in risk of progression, possibly due to a “carryover \neffect.” The reduction in risk of recurrence was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.79 –1.02) \nduring 5 to 9 years of tamoxifen treatment and 0.75 (0.62– 0.90) after 10 \nyears of treatment. There were decreases in the incidence of contralateral \nbreast cancer  as well. Furthermore, reduced mortality was also apparent \nafter completion of 10 years of treatment with tamoxifen. With regards to toxicity, the most important adverse effects noted in all patients  in the \nATLAS trial after with 10 years of tamoxifen treatment were an increased risk for endometrial cancer and pulmonary embolism.\n291 The results of the \naTTom trial confirm the significant  reduction in recurrence and death from breast cancer seen in the ATLAS trial with 10 versus 5  years of tamoxifen \ntherapy.292   \nAromatase inhibitors:  Several  studies have evaluated aromatase inhibitors \n(AI) in the treatment of postmenopausal patients  with early -stage breast \ncancer. These studies have utilized AI  as initial adjuvant therapy, as \nsequential therapy following 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen, or as extended \ntherapy following 4.5 to 6 years of tamoxifen. The AIs are not active in the \ntreatment of patients  with functioning ovaries and should not be used in \npatients  whose ovarian function cannot reliably be assessed owing to \ntreatment -induced amenorrhea .  \nThe results from two prospective, randomized,  clinical trials have provided \nevidence of an OS benefit for patients with early -stage breast cancer \nreceiving initial endocrine therapy with tamoxifen followed sequentially by \nanastrozole ( HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28– 0.99; P = .045) or exemestane ( HR, \n0.83; 95% CI, 0.69– 1.00; P = .05 [excluding patients with ER -negative \ndisease]) when compared with tamoxifen as the only endocrine \ntherapy.293,294 In addition, the NCIC -CTG MA -17 trial demonstrated a \nsurvival advantage with extended therapy with letrozole compared with \nplacebo in patients  with ALN-positive (but not lymph node -negative), \nER-positive breast cancer.295 Tamoxifen  and aromatase inhibitors have \ndifferent side effect profiles. Both contribute to hot flashes  and night \nsweats  and may cause vaginal dryness.  AIs are more commonly \nassociated with musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis, and increased \nrate of bone fracture, while tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk \nfor uterine cancer and deep venous thrombosis.  \nTwo studies have examined initial adjuvant endocrine treatment  with either \ntamoxifen or an AI . The ATAC trial demonstrated that anastrozole is \nsuperior to tamoxifen or the combination of tamoxifen and anastrozole in \nthe adjuvant endocrine therapy of postmenopausal patients  with \nHR-positive breast cancer.296,297 With a median of 100  months follow -up, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

Patients in  the combined tamoxifen \nand anastrozole group gained no benefit over those in the tamoxifen \ngroup, suggesting a possible deleterious effect from the weak estrogenic \neffect of tamoxifen in patients with near complete elimination of \nendogenous estrogen levels.297 ATAC trial sub -protocols show a lesser \neffect of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen on endometrial tissue;299 \nsimilar effects of anastrozole and tamoxifen on quality of life, with most \npatients reporting that overall quality of life was not significantly \nimpaired;300 a greater loss of bone mineral density with anastrozole ;301 a \nsmall pharmacokinetic interference of anastrozole in the presence of \ntamoxifen of unclear significance;302 and no evidence for an interaction \nbetween prior chemotherapy and anastrozole.303 \nBIG 1 -98 is a randomized trial testing the use of tamoxifen alone for 5 \nyears, letrozole alone for 5 years,  or tamoxifen for 2 years followed \nsequentially by letrozole for 3 years, or letrozole for 2  years followed \nsequenti ally by tamoxifen for 3 years. An early analysis compared \ntamoxifen alone versus letrozole alone, including those patients in the sequential arms during their first 2  years of treatment only.\n304 With 8010 \npatients  included in the analysis, DFS  was superior in the letrozole- treated \npatients  (HR, 0.81; 95% CI , 0.70–0.93; log rank P = .003) . No interaction \nbetween PR expre ssion and benefit was observed.  No difference in OS  \nwas observed.  A comparison of the cardiovascular side effects in the \ntamoxifen and letrozole arms of the BIG 1 -98 trial showed that the overall \nincidence of cardiac adverse events was similar  (letrozole, 4.8%; \ntamoxifen, 4.7%). However, the incidence of grade 3 to 5 cardiac adverse \nevents was significantly higher in the letrozole arm,  and both the overall \nincidence and incidence of grade 3 to 5 thromboembolic events was significantly higher in the tamoxifen arm.305 In addition, a higher incidence \nof bone fracture was observed for patients in the letrozole arm compared with those in the tamoxifen arm (9.5% vs. 6.5%).\n306 After a longer \nfollow- up (median 71 months) no significant improvement in DFS  was \nnoted with either tamoxifen followed by letrozole or the reverse sequence \nas compared with letrozole alone ( HR for tamoxifen followed by letrozole, \n1.05; 99% CI, 0.84– 1.32; HR for letrozole followed by tamoxifen, 0.96; \n99% CI, 0.76– 1.21) .307 \nFive trials have studied the use of tamoxifen for 2  to 3 years followed \nsequentially by a third -generation AI versus continued tamoxifen in \npostmenopausal patients. The Italian Tamoxifen Anastrozole (ITA) trial \nrandomized 426 postmenopausal patients  with breast cancer who had \ncompleted 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen to either continue tamoxifen or to \nswitch to anastrozole to complete a total of 5  years of endocrine \ntherapy.308 The HR for relapse strongly favored sequential treatment with \nanastrozole ( HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.18– 0.68; P = .001) with a trend towards \nfewer deaths ( P = .10).308 Updated results from this study show the HR for \nrelapse- free survival as 0.56 (95% CI, 0.35– 0.89; P = .01); P value for OS  \nanalysis remained at 0.1.309 The IES trial randomized 4742 \npostmenopausal patients  with breast cancer who had completed a total of \n2 to 3 years of tamoxifen to either continue tamoxifen or to switch to \nexem estane to complete a total of 5 years of endocrine therapy.310 The \nresults at a median of 55.7 months of follow -up demonstrated the \nsuperiority of sequential exemestane in DFS  (HR, 0.76; 95% CI , 0.66–\n0.88; P = .0001) with a significant difference in OS in only patients with \nER-positive tumors ( HR, 0.83; 95% CI , 0.69–1.00; log rank P  = .05). A \nprospectively planned, combined analysis of 3224 patients enrolled in the ABCSG  8 trial and the ARNO 95 trial has also been reported.\n311 Patients \nin this combined analysis  had been randomized following 2 years of \ntamoxifen to complete 5 y ears of  adjuvant tamoxifen or 3 years of \nanastrozole.

No statistically significant difference in survival has \nbeen observed. An analysis of the ARNO 95 trial alone after 58 months of \nmedian follow -up demonstrated that switching from tamoxifen to \nanastrozole was associated with significant increases in both DFS  (HR, \n0.66; 95% CI, 0.44– 1.00; P = .049) and OS  (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28– 0.99; \nP = .045).294 A meta -analysis of ABCSG 8, ARNO 95,  and ITA studies \nshowed significant improvement in OS (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52- 0.98; P = \n.04) with a switch to anastrozole .312  \nThe TEAM trial compared treatment of exemestane alone versus \nsequential therapy of tamoxifen for 2. 5 to 3 .0 years followed by \nexemestane to complete 5 years of hormone therapy.313 At the end of 5 \nyears, 85% of patients in the sequential group versus 86% in the \nexemestane group were disease free ( HR, 0.97; 95% CI , 0.88–1.08; P = \n.60). This is consistent with the data from the BIG 1- 98 trial ,307 in which \ntamoxifen followed by letrozole or the reverse sequence of letrozole \nfollowed by tamoxifen was not associated with significant differences in \nefficacy versus letrozole monotherapy after a median follow -up of 71 \nmonths .  \nThe NCCN p anel finds no meaningful differences in terms of efficacy or \ntoxicity between the available AIs: anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane. \nAll three have shown similar anti -tumor efficacy and toxicity profiles in \nrandomized studies in the adjuvant settings.   \nOvarian Function Suppression and Endocrine Therapy :   \nOvarian function suppression (OFS) is achieved with a  \ngonadotropin- releasing hormone  (GnRH)  agonist, oophorectomy, or \novarian irradiation. Available Gn RH agonists in the United States include \ngoserelin and leuprolide.  OFS is generally considered in those who are \npremenopausal and for tumors with high enough recurrence risk where the \nadditional absolute decrease in recurrence compared with tamoxifen alone is worth the additional toxicity (young age, high- grade tumor, lymph node \ninvolvement).  A balanced discussion of the risks and benefits associated \nwith OFS is critical, including the potential side effects of premature \nmenopause.   \n In two randomized trials (TEXT and SOFT), premenopausal patients with \nHR-positive early -stage breast cancer were assigned to receive AI \n(exemestane) plus OFS or tamoxifen plus OFS for a period of 5 years.\n314 \nSuppression of ovarian estrogen production was achieved with the use of \nGnRH agonist triptorelin, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation.  The DFS \nwas 92.8% in the exemestane plus OFS as compared with 88.8% in the tamoxifen plus OFS (HR for recurrence, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55– 0.80; P < \n.001).\n314 The OS did not differ significantly between the two groups (HR for \ndeath in the exemestane plus OFS group, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.86– 1.51; P = \n.37).314  \n \nA 9-year median follow -up analysis of the TEXT- SOFT trials showed \nsustained improvements in DFS with exemestane plus OFS versus \ntamoxifen plus OFS  (HR - 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.90) and in distant \nrecurrence- free interval but not OS (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.22).315 \nUltimately, with longer follow -up (median = 13 years), an OS was \ndemonstrated for OFS + exemestane in patients with high- risk of \nrecurrence, but not in .exemestane plus OFS in patients with lower risk of \nrelapse not receiving chemotherapy.316 \n \nThe benefit of OFS in premenopausal patients with high- risk of recurrence \nwas also seen in the results of the ASTRRA trial.  This trial  studied \npremenopausal patients (n= 1483) with HR -positive breast cancer younger \nthan 45 years treated with surgery and who received chemotherapy ( as \nadjuvant or preoperative therapy ) and received 5 years of tamoxifen alone \nor 5 years of tamoxifen with OFS for 2 years.

The NCCN Panel has included OFS  plus \nendocrine therapy  for 5 years as an option for premenopausal patients  \nwith HR–positive breast cancer at higher ris k of recurr ence (eg, young \nage, high- grade tumor, lymph- node involvement). Premenopausal patients \nwishing to continue adjuvant endocrine therapy after ovarian suppression \nis stopped should continue with tamoxifen versus AI.   \nDuration of Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy  \nAdjuvant endocrine therapy is recommended for a minimum of 5 years. A \nrecent retrospective analysis by the Oxford University studied risk of \nrecurrence for years 5 through 20 after 5 years of endocrine therapy. 318 \nThese data showed a considerable risk of recurrence between years 5 and 20 in these patients treated with initial 5 years of endocrine therapy.\n318 \nData has now emerged showing benefit of extended endocrine therapy in \nimproving DFS.  \n \nData from the ATLAS trial (discussed above)291 and the aTTom trial \nconfirm greater reduction in recurrence and death from breast cancer with 10 versus 5 years of tamoxifen therapy.\n292   \nFor those treated initially with adjuvant tamoxifen, there is evidence for \nbenefit from extended adjuvant endocrine therapy from several \nrandomized trials.  Results of the MA -17 trial in 5187 patients  who had \ncompleted 4.5 to 6 years of adjuvant tamoxifen demonstrated that \nextended therapy with letrozole provides benefit in postmenopausal \npatients  with HR- positive, early -stage breast cancer.295,319 With a median \nfollow- up of 64 months, letrozole was associated with improved DFS (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.45 -0.61) and an improved OS (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52 -0.71) \ncompared with placebo.320 \nIn a separate cohort analysis of the MA -17 trial, the efficacy of letrozole \nversus placebo was evaluated after un -blinding of the study in the 1579 \npatients  who had been randomly assigned to placebo after 4.5 to 6 years \nof tamoxifen.321,322 The median time since completion of tamoxifen was 2.8 \nyears. Both DFS and distant DFS were significantly improved in the group \nreceiving letrozole, thereby providing some evidence for the efficacy of \nletrozole in patients who had received 4.5 to 6 years o f tamoxifen therapy \nfollowed by no endocrine therapy for an extended period. A formal quality -of-life analysis demonstrated reasonable preservation of quality of \nlife during extended endocrine therapy, although patients  may experience \nongoing menopausal sy mptoms and loss of bone mineral density.\n323,324 No \ndata are available regarding use of aromatase inhibitors for more than 5 years or long -term toxic effects from  extended treatment. In addition, the \nATLAS trial data do not provide clear direction for treatment of postmenopausal patients .\n291 There are no data available to suggest that \nan AI for 5 years is better for long- term benefit than 10 years of tamoxifen.  \nIn the extension study of ABCSG trial 6, HR -positive postmenopausal \npatients received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen and were randomized to 3 \nyears of anastrozole or no further therapy.325 At a median follow -up of 62.3 \nmonths, patients  who received anastrozole (n = 387) were reported to \nhave a statistically significantly reduced risk of recurrence compared with \npatients  who received no further treatment (n = 469; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, \n0.40– 0.96; P = .031).325 \nThe differences in design and patient populations among the studies of the \naromatase inhibitors do not allow for the direct comparison of the results of \nthese studies.

The annual rate of contralateral \nbreast cancer reported was lower with letrozole (0.49% vs. 0.21%; HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22 -0.81%). However, longer duration of AI resulted in more \nfrequent bone -related adverse effects compared with those who received \nplacebo and no improvement was observed with respect to OS. \nBone- related adverse effects included bone pain (18% vs. 14%), fractures \n(14% vs. 9%), and new -onset osteoporosis (11% vs. 6%).\n327 Patients with \nhigh- risk of recurrence (eg. those with lymph node involvement) may \nbenefit from extended AI duration (7.5– 10 years total).328,329  \nNCCN Recommendations : The decision of whether or not to extend \nadjuvant treatment based on the evidence available should be \nindividualized. When considering endocrine therapy, t he Panel  \nrecommends  the following adjuvant endocrine therapy options for patients \nwith early -stage breast cancer . \nAdjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Postmenopausal Patients:  The NCCN \nPanel recommends AI as initial adjuvant therapy for 5 years ( category 1); \nand tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years followed by one of the following options: an \nAI to complete 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy  (category 1) or 5 \nyears of AI therapy (category 2B); or tamoxifen for 4.5 to 6 years followed \nby 5 years of AI (category 1) or consideration of tamoxifen for up to 10 years. In postmenopausal patients, the use of tamoxifen alone for 5 years \n(category 1) or up to 10 years is limited to those who decline or who have \na contraindication to AI s. \nAdjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Premenopausal Patients : If \npremenopausal at diagnosis, the NCCN Panel  recommend  5 years of \ntamoxifen alone (category 1) or tamoxifen with OFS (category 1) or OFS  \nplus AI for 5 years  (category 1). Patients who are premenopausal at \ndiagnosis and who become amenorrheic with chemotherapy may have \ncontinued estrogen production from the ovaries without menses. \nMenopausal status cannot be determined while receiving OFS . AI can \nstimulate ovarian function.   To assure a true postmenopausal status , serial \nassessment of circulating LH, FSH, and estradiol is mandatory  when \nconsidering this subset for AI therapy.330,331 Frequency of testing of \nestradiol and FSH/LH levels should be individualized.  \nAfter 5 years of initial endocrine therapy , for patients  who are \npostmenopausal at that time (including those who have become postmenopausal during the 5 years of tamoxifen therapy), the NCCN  \nPanel recommends considering extended therapy with an AI for up to 5 \nyears  (category 1) or based on the data from the ATLAS trial considering \ntamoxifen for an additional 5 years. For those who remain premenopausal after the initial 5 years of tamoxifen, the panel recommends considering \ncontinuing up to 10 years of tamoxifen therapy.  \nAdditional considerations during  Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy : Symptom \nmanagement for patients on adjuvant endocrine therapies often requires \ntreatment of hot flashes and the treatment of concurrent depression.  \nVenlafaxine, a serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) has \nbeen studied and is an effective intervention in decreasing hot flashes.\n332-\n335 There is evidence suggesting that concomitant use of tamoxifen with \ncertain SSRIs (eg, paroxetine, fluoxetine) may decrease plasma levels of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

Those with one or two variant alleles with \neither reduced or no activity are designated as intermediate \nmetabolizers and poor metabolizers , respectively.  The mild CYP2D6 \ninhibitors such as citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine \nappear to have no or only minimal effect on tamoxifen metabolism .330,338,339 \nWith respect to CYP2D6 mutation status, a  large retrospective study of \n1325 patients found that time to disease recurrence was significantly \nshortened in poor metabolizers of tamoxifen.340 However , the BIG 1 -98 \ntrial reported on the outcome based on CYP2D6  genotype in a subset of \npostmenopausal patients with endocrine- responsive,  early invasive breast \ncancer.  The study found no correlation between CYP2D6 allelic status and \ndisease outcome or between CYP2D6 allelic status and tamoxifen- related \nadverse effects.341 A genetic analysis of the ATAC trial found no \nassociation between CYP2D6 genotype and clinical outcomes.342,343  \nGiven the limited and conflicting evidence at this time,344 the NCCN Breast \nCancer Panel does not recommend CYP2D6 testing as a tool to determine \nthe optimal adjuvant endocrine strategy . This recommendation is \nconsistent with the ASCO Guidelines.345 When prescribing a selective \nserotonin r euptake inhibitor  ( SSRI ), it is reasonable to avoid potent and \nintermediate CYP2D6 inhibiting agents, particularly paroxetine and \nfluoxetine, if an appropriate alternative exists.   \nFor those on tamoxifen, while age- appropriate gynecologic screening is \nrecommended, the use of routine annual pelvic ultrasound is not \nrecommended. For those receiving AI or who experience ovarian failure \nsecondary to treatment should have monitoring of bone health with a bone \nmineral density determination at baseline and periodically thereafter. .The panel discourages the selective ER modulators to treat osteoporosis or \nosteopenia in patients with breast cancer. The use of a bisphosphonate \n(oral/IV) or denosumab is recommended to maintain or to improve bone \nmineral density and reduce risk of fractures in postmenopausal (natural or \ninduced) patients receiving adjuvant AI therapy. Optimal duration of either \ntherapy has not been established. The optimal durati on and benefits \nbeyond 3 years is not known. Factors to consider for duration of anti -\nosteoporosis therapy include bone mineral density, response to therapy, \nand risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture. There are case reports \nof spontaneous fractu res after denosumab discontinuation. Patients \ntreated with bisphosphonates or denosumab should undergo a dental \nexamination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of therapy, and \nshould take supplemental calcium and vitamin D.  \nThe incremental benefit of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine \ntherapy in patients with low clinical risk of recurrence such as those with \nvery small, low grade, lymph node -negative tumors is relatively small.346  \nThe decision whether or not to administer  adjuvant chemotherapy in \npatients with HR- positive, HER2 -negative tumors  is based on many \nfactors including lymph node status, size, grade, lymphovascular invasion, \nage, comorbid conditions and/or the results of a gene expression profile \ntest using multigene assays.   \n Several commercially -available gene- based assays are useful in \ndetermining prognosis by predict ing distant recurrence, local recurrence, \nor survival . Of these, only one, the 21- gene assay (Oncotype Dx) has \nbeen clinically validated for predicting the benefit of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to further reduce the risk of recurrence.  \n21-gene assay (Oncotype DX) in Node -negative, HR -positive, \nHER2 -negative disease:  The 21- gene recurrence score (RS) is one of the \nmost validated multigene assays.

In a \nsecondary analysis of the SWOG 8814 trial of patients  with HR-positi ve, \nlymph node -positive tumors, high RS ( ≥31) was predictive of \nchemotherapy benefit. This study evaluated breast cancer specimens from node- positive, HR- positive postmenopausal patients (n= 367) random ized \nto endocrine therapy with tamoxifen  alone or chemotherapy with CAF \nfollowed by tamoxifen.\n350 Compared with tamoxifen alone, treatment with \nCAF among patients with a high RS (≥31) resulted in improved 10 -year \nDFS (55% vs. 43%; HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 -1.01) and OS (73% vs. 54%; \nHR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31 -1.02).350  \nThe Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S1007 RxPONDER trial,357 \nassigned patients with 1- 3 lymph node- positive nodes, HR -positive, \nHER2 -negative breast cancer and a RS ≤ 25 to standard endocrine \ntherapy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy.

In this trial, \n79% had lymph node- negative disease and 21% had 1- 3 positive lymph \nnodes and all patients underwent risk assessment by clinical criteria (using \nAdjuvant! Online) and genomic risk assessment by the 70- gene assay.  \nPatients with low- risk disease according to both clinical criteria and \ngenomic  assay results did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas \npatients categorized as high- risk by both assessments  received \nchem otherapy. Patients with discordant results (i.e., either high clinical \nrisk/low genomic risk or low clinical risk/high genomic risk) were \nrandomized  to the chemotherapy group or the no -chemotherapy group on \nthe basis of either the clinical result or the genomic result.  The primary \noutcome of the study was met with the demonstration that among those \nwith high clinical risk/ low genomic risk , the 5-year rate of survival without \ndistant metastasis in those did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy was \n94.7% (95% CI, 92.5 to 96.2) .359 \nIn the intention- to-treat population, among patients at high clinical risk/low \ngenomic risk by the 70- gene assay, the 5 -year rate of survival with no \ndistant metastasis in those who received chemotherapy was 95.9% (95% \nCI, 94.0 to 97.2) versus 94.4% (95% CI, 92.3 to 95.9) in those who did not \nreceive chemotherapy  (adjusted HR for distant metastasis  or death with \nchemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy  0.78; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.21).359 Among \npatients at low clinical risk / high genomic risk , 5-year survival with  no \ndistant metastasis was 95.8% with chemotherapy (95% CI, 92.9 to 97.6), compared with a rate of 95.0% (95% CI, 91.8 to 97.0%) without \nchemotherapy (adjusted HR for distant metastasis or death with \nchemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.59 to 2.28). These \ndata suggest that the results of the 70 -gene signature do not provide \nevidence for making recommendations regarding chemotherapy for \npatients at low clinical risk.\n359 In a subgroup analysis by nodal status, among node- negative patients \nwith high clinical risk/low genomic risk, the 5 -year rate of survival with no \ndistant metastasis was 95.7% (95% CI, 93.0 to 97.4) in those who \nreceived adjuvant chemotherapy compared with 93.2% (95% CI, 90.1 to \n95.4) in those who did not receive chemotherapy.359 Among patients with \n1-3 positive lymph nodes, the rates of survival without distant metastases \nwere 96.3% (95% CI, 93.1 to 98.1) in those who received adjuvant \nchemotherapy versus 95.6 (95% CI, 92.7 to 97.4) in those who did not \nreceive adjuvant chemotherapy.359 These data suggest that the additional \nbenefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high- clinical risk/low \ngenomic risk is likely to be small.  \n50-gene assay (PAM50) : The 50-gene assay (PAM -50) risk of recurrence \n(ROR) score stratifies patients with HR- positive disease into high, \nmedium, and low risk groups . Several studies have demonstrated t he \nprognostic value of ROR score in estimating risk of disease recurrence.360-\n362  \nIn a study from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group database, patients with lymph node node- negative tumors and low ROR had a \ndistant recurrence risk of 5.0% (95% CI, 2.9% to 8.0%) whereas tumors \nwith high ROR had a distant recurrence risk of 17.8% (95% CI, 14.0% to \n22.0%).\n361  Based on these analyses, patients with T1 and T2, \nHR-positive, HER2 - negative, lymph node -negative tumors, a ROR score \nin the low range, regardless of tumor size, places the individual into the \nsame prognostic category as those with T1a– T1b, N0, M0 tumors.361  \nIn patients with 1 -3 lymph -node positive, HR- positive, HER2 -negative \ndisease with low -risk of recurrence score, the distant recurrence risk was \nless than 3.5% at 10 years  with endocrine therapy alone.361 In TransATAC \nstudy , no distant recurrence was seen at 10 years in a similar group.362 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-42 \n12-gene assay (EndoPredict):  This assay utilizes 12- genes to calculate a \nprognostic score.  This assay appears to be useful in identifying a \nsubgroup of patients with ER -positive, HER2 -negative tumors with very \nlow risk of recurrence without adjuvant chemotherapy and helpful in \nidentifying patients at low risk for a late recurrence.363 Based on results of \ntwo Austrian Breast Cancer Study Group trials - ABCSG -6 and ABCSG -8, \npatients with HR- positive, HER- 2 negative, and lymph- node node- negative \ndisease with a low -risk score by the 12- gene assay had risk of distant \nrecurrence of 4% at 10 y ears.363 The prognostic value of the risk score \nfrom the 12 -gene assay was found to be independent of conventional \nclinicopathological factors. Patients with T1 and T2 HR -positive, \nHER2 -negative, and lymph node- negative tumors, a 12- gene low -risk \nscore, regardless  of T size, places the tumor into the same prognostic \ncategory as T1a– T1b, N0, M0.   \nIn TransATAC study, patients with 1 -3 positive nodes in the low -risk group \nhad a 5.6% risk of distant recurrence at 10 years,362 suggesting that \nchemotherapy would be of limited benefit in these patients.  \nBreast Cancer Index : The Breast Cancer Index (BCI) is a combination of \ntwo profiles, the HOXB13- to-IL17BR expression ratio (H:I ratio) and the \nMolecular Grade Index (MGI). Compared with clinical prognostic factors \n(eg, age, tumor size, tumor grade, and lymph node status), the H:I ratio \nhas been shown to be prognostic  in the setting of adjuvant tamoxifen \nmonotherapy.362,364 The addition of MGI to H:I was determined to provide \nadditional prognostic discrimination, leading to the BCI assay.364 In a \nsecondary analysis of the ATAC trial, BCI was prognostic in node negative \nbreast cancer for both early (years 0- 5) and late (years 5 -10) distant \nrecurrence.365  For patients with T1 and T2 HR- positive, HER2 -negative, \nand lymph node- negative tumors, a BCI in the low -risk range, regardless \nof T size, places the tumor into the same prognostic category as T1a- T1b, \nN0, M0.  Secondary analyses of the MA.17, Trans -aTTom, and IDEAL trials showed that in patients with HR -positive T1 –T3 tumors that are \nlymph -node negative or positive, those that had a high BCI (H/I) \ndemonstrated significant improvements in DFS when adjuvant endocrine \ntherapy was extended, compared to the control arm.366- 368 Considering the \nability  of the multigene assays  to predict benefit of adjuvant systemic \nchemotherapy and ability to determine prognosis by predic ting risk of \ndistant recurrence,  the NCCN Panel has summarized the treatment \nimplications based on risk scores and nodal status.  \n Multigene Assays for Axillary Lymph Node- Negative HR- Positive, \nHER2 -Negative Tumor s  \nSmall tumors (up to 0.5 cm in greatest diameter) that do not involve the \nlymph nodes have a favorable prognosis so adjuvant chemo therapy  is not \nrecommended. According to the NCCN Panel, adjuvant endocrine therapy  \nmay be considered in this group of patients to reduce the risk for  a second \ncontralateral breast cancer, as well as the small benefit in reducing the risk of local/regional and distant recurrence.(Category 2B).   \nFor patients with invasive ductal or lobular tumors greater than 0. 5 cm in \ndiameter and no lymph node involvement (lymph node node- negative), the \nNCCN panel recommends strongly considering the 21- gene RT- PCR \nassay to help estimat e likelihood of recurrence and benefit from \nchemotherapy (category 1). The panel has noted that on an exploratory \nanalysis from the TAILORx study,\n353 adjuvant chemotherapy may be \nconsidered in patients 50 years of age or younger with a 21 -gene RS of \n16-25. Also, patients with T1b tumors with low grade histology should be \nconsidered for endocrine monotherapy, as the TAILORx study353 did not \ninclude patients with such tumors.  \nThe panel notes that other prognostic multigene assays may be \nconsidered to help estimate risk of recurrence, but these assays have not \nbeen validated to predict the benefit of systemic chemotherapy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-43 \namongst the other assays, the panel has listed the 70- gene assay as a \ncategory 1 option based on the results of the prospective MINDACT359 trial \ndemonstrating the ability of the 70 -gene assay to identify a good genomic \nrisk population despite a high clinical risk, in whom chemotherapy may be \nomitted without a detrimental effect.  High clinical risk in the MINDACT trial \nwas defined for grade 1 tumors as >3 cm N0 or T2N1, for grade 2 tumors T2N0- 1, and for grade 3 tumors T1c -2N0-1. \nFurthermore, given no difference in outcomes with or without chemotherapy in the discordant low clinical risk/high genomic risk group, \nthe MINDACT study suggests that the 70 -gene panel is not useful guiding \nsystemic chemotherapy decisions in this subgroup of patients.  \nSince results of different assays may not be concordant with each other \nand these assays have not been compared head- to-head prospectively, \nclinicians should only order one of the available assays for a specific patient and tumor .  \nMultigene Assays for Axillary Lymph Node- Positive HR-  Positive, \nHER2 -Negative Tumors  \nFor patients with four or more involved nodes the panel recommends \nsystemic adjuvant chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy (category \n1). \nPatients with less than four involved nodes or with pN1mi and less than or equal to 2 mm axillary node metastasis, are most often  candidates for \nchemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy. The panel recommends \nthat clinical decision making for adjuvant chemotherapy be based on \nelements of  clinical risk stratification such as clinical characteristics, tumor \nstage, pathology and comorbid conditions. If the patient is not a candidate for chemotherapy, the panel recommends adjuvant endocrine therapy \nalone (c ategory 2A).  For those who are candidates for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy based \non clinical characteristics, tumor stage, and pathology, the panel \nrecommends consideration of multigene assays to assess prognosis as a \ntool to assist with treatment decision making. The panel notes in those with N1mi and N1 tumors, while multigene assays have yet to be proven \nto be predictive for adjuvant chemotherapy benefit, they are prognostic \nand can be used to identify low -risk patients who are likely to derive little \nor no absolut e benefit from addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to adjuvant \nendocrine therapy. A secondary analysis of the prospective SWOG 8814 \ntrial using  the 21 -gene assay  demonstrated no benefit for chemotherapy \nfor patients with 1- 3 involved axillary lymph nodes and a low RS, and a \nsignificant benefit for the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy in those with \nhigh- RS (≥ 31) .\n350  The phase III RxPONDER trial prospectively \ndemonstrated that for premenopausal patients with hormone receptor –\npositive, HER2 -negative, node- positive breast cancer , a 21- gene assay \nRecurrence  Scores  up to 25 had an addition benefit of adjuvant \nchemotherapy to endocrine therapy for improv ing invasive disease– free \nsurvival .358 In the MINDACT trial, among patients with 1 -3 positive nodes \nwho had a high clinical risk of recurrence but low risk by the 70- gene \nassay, the rates of survival were similar between those who received \nadjuvant chemotherapy in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy versus \nthose received adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, suggesting that \nchemotherapy could be omitted in this group.359 Other multigene assays \nhave not proven to be predictive of benefit from chemotherapy.  \nFor those who are candidates for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy based on clinical characteristics, tumor stage, and pathology, if multigene assay \nis not available, the panel recommends systemic adjuvant chemotherapy \nfollowed by endocrine therapy (category 1).  \nAdjuvant Targeted therapies for HR -positive, HER2 -negative tumors  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-44 \nAdjuvant therapies are rapidly evolving and CDK 4/6 inhibitors and PARP \ninhibitors are now indicated in this setting.  \nAdjuvant CDK 4/6 inhibitors : In the MonarchE study, the addition of 2 \nyears of abemaciclib to endocrine therapy reduced the absolute risk of \nrecurrence at 4 years by 6.4% ( HR 0.664, 95% CI 0.578 -0.762, P <  \n.0001)  in patients with HR- positive/HER2 -negative, high- risk breast \ncancer , defined as 4 or more pathologically involved  lymph nodes \nconfirmed preoperatively and/or at surgery , or  1–3 pathologically involved \nlymph nodes with additional high risk features ( grade 3 or size ≥5 cm \nbased on pre- operative imaging and/or pathologically at surgery).369  \nTwo trials of palbociclib as adjuvant therapy in HR -positive, HER2 –\nnegative early breast cancer did not show benefit of adding palbociclib to \nadjuvant endocrine therapy  in terms of invasive disease- free survival.370,371  \nThe results from the NATALEE trial reported after a median follow -up of \n34 months, showed a statistically significant improvement  (3.3%)  in \ninvasive disease- free survival with the addition of ribociclib to adjuvant \nendocrine therapy (HR- 0.75, 95% CI 0.62 -0.91,  P = .003).) for stage II and \nstage III HR -positive, HER2 -negative breast cancer.372 Additional follow -up \nis needed to characterize the long- term efficacy of ribociclib in this setting .  \nAccording to the current guidelines, 2 years of adjuvant CDK 4/6 therapy \nwith abemaciclib should be considered in combination with endocrine \ntherapy in patients with HR- positive/HER2 -negative, high- risk breast \ncancer ( as detailed above). This is a category 1, preferred option for this \nsetting.  \nAdjuvant Olaparib: In patients with germline BRCA  1/2 mutations  and \nhigh- risk HER2 -negative tumors, the results of the OlympiA trial  showed \nthat the 4- year OS in the group that received 1 year of adjuvant olaparib \nwas 89.8% and 86.4% in the placebo group (95% CI -0.1% -6.8%).  The 4-year invasive DFS for the olaparib group versus placebo group was 82.7% \nversus 75.4% (95% CI 3.0% -  11.5%) and 4- year distant DFS was 86.5% \nversus 79.1% (95% CI 3.6% - 11.3%).373 \nAccording to the NCCN panel, addition of adjuvant olaparib for 1 year may \nbe considered for those with germline BRCA  1/2 mutations in patients with \nHR-positive, HER2 -negative tumors with ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes after \nadjuvant chemotherapy or residual disease after preoperative therapy and \na clinical stage, pathologic stage, ER status, and tumor grade (CPS+EG) score ≥3  (category 2A).  \n \nAdjuvant olaparib may be used concurrently with endocrine therapy.  \nIn patients eligible for both adjuvant olaparib and abemaciclib, the optimal sequencing  is not know n. (For sequencing of o laparib and/or a bemaciclib \nwith RT, see BINV -I on nccn.org ) \nAdjuvant bisphosphonate therapy  \nAntiresorptive agents (bisphosphonates and denosumab) have an established role as preventative and therapeutic agents for the \nmanagement of osteoporosis, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and bone \nmetastases.  \nBisphosphonates:\n In the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study \nGroup trial -12 (ABCSG -12) trial, for patients over 40 years, zoledronic acid \nsignificantly reduced the risk of recurrence by 34% (HR, 0.66; P=.014) and \nthe risk of death by 49% (HR, 0.51; P =.020). However, no improvement \nwas seen in either DFS or OS in this post hoc analysis among patients \nunder  40 year s.374 In a planned subgroup analysis of the AZURE trial, \nzoledronic acid improved DFS in patients  who were more than 5 years \nsince menopause at trial entry.375 A meta -analysis of data from seven \nadjuvant bisphosphonate trials (AZURE, ABCSG -12, ZO -FAST, Z -FAST, \nEZO-FAST, NSABP- B34, GAIN), including only those known to be over 50 \nyears, postmenopausal, or with ovarian suppression, showed a significant PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

No effect was seen on distant recurrence outside \nbone (RR =0.98, P =0.69).377 In premenopausal patients, bisphosphonate \ntherapy did not seem to have a significant effect on bone recurrence.  \nHowever, in postmenopausal patients, zoledronic acid significantly \nreduced bone recurrence (3.4% vs. 4.5%, RR=0.73, 99% CI 0.53 to 1.00); \nthe difference in breast cancer mortality was not statistically significant \n(7.1% vs. 7.9%, RR=0.88, 99% CI 0.69 to 1.11).377   \nDenosumab: In the adjuvant setting, the ABCSG -18 trial studied the effect \nof denosumab in postmenopausal patients treated with adjuvant AIs and \nshowed a reduction in clinical fractures (HR 0.5, P < .0001), which was the \nprimary endpoint of this study.378 The final analysis after a median follow -\nup of 8 years continued to show a benefit with denosumab. Adjuvant \ndenosumab improved bone metastasis -free survival (88.9 vs. 86.4%; HR, \n0.81; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.00) and OS (90.9 vs. 89.9%; HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.01) .\n379 In contrast, results of the phase III trial (D -Care) trial failed \nto demonstrate a difference in bone metastasis -free survival in those \nreceiving denosumab versus placebo.380 \n Due to these conflicting results from phase III trials, denosumab is \ncurrently not recommended in the adjuvant setting.379 The panel \nrecommends considering adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy for risk reduction of distant metastasis for 3– 5 years in patients with high- risk \nnode negative or node- positive tumors.   Adjuvant Therapy for HER2- negative tumors  \nSeveral  combination chemotherapy regimens are appropriate to consider \nfor HR -positive or negative and HER2- negative tumors. All adjuvant \nchemotherapy r egimens listed in the NCCN Guidelines have been \nevaluated in phase III clinical trials and are category 1 unless otherwise \nnoted.  \nPreferred Regimens  \nRegimens listed as preferred include dose- dense doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide (AC) followed or preceded by paclitaxel either weekly or biweekly; docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide (TC); olaparib for germline \nBRCA  1/2 mutations; pembrolizumab for high- risk ER - disease; and \ncapecitabine for residual ER - disease after preoperative chemotherapy.   \nMeta -analysis from Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group \n(EBCTCG) has shown that anthracycline and taxane- based combination \nchemotherapy reduces the risk of breast cancer mortality compared with \nno chemotherapy. The use of dose- dense schedules  has shown to further \nreduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence or death without increasing mortality. \n381 \nThe results of two randomized trials comparing AC chemotherapy with or \nwithout sequential paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients  with axillary \nnode- positive breast cancer suggest improved disease- free rates and \nresults from one of the trials showed an improvement in OS, with the \naddition of paclitaxel.382,383 On retrospective analysis, the apparent \nadvantage of the paclitaxel -containing regimen appears  greater in patients  \nwith ER-negative breast cancers.   \nA randomized trial evaluated the use of concurrent versus sequential chemotherapy (doxorubicin followed by paclitaxel followed by \ncyclophosphamide vs. doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

At a median follow -up of 73 months, \nresults from the 3- arm randomized NSABP B -30 trial comparing TAC \nversus AT versus AC followed by docetaxel (AC followed by T) \ndemonstrated that AC followed by T had a significant advantage in DFS \n(HR, 0.83; P  = .006) but not in OS (HR, 0.86; P = .086) when compared \nwith TAC. In addition, both DFS (HR, 0.080; P  = .001) and OS (HR, 0.83; \nP = .034) were significantly increased when AC followed by T was \ncompared with AT, with AT demonstrating non -inferiority compared with \nTAC.392  \nUseful in Certain Circumstances : \nRegimens included in this category include dose dense AC; AC every 3 \nweeks (Category 2B); CMF; AC followed by weekly paclitaxel; and  \ncapecitabine as maintenance therapy for TNBC after adjuvant  \nchemotherapy .  \nThe phase III E1199  trial compared patients with node- positive or high- risk \nnode- negative breast cancer who received 4 cycles of AC every 3 weeks, \nfollowed by either paclitaxel or docetaxel, either weekly or every 3 weeks. \nThe 10-year updated results  of this trial showed that incorporation of  \nweekly paclitaxel and docetaxel every 3 weeks was  associated with \nsignificant improvements in DFS, and marginal improvements in OS , \ncompared with paclitaxel given every 3 weeks.

Some support for this  recommendation \ncomes from studies showing a higher risk of recurrence for patients with HER2 -positive, node -negative tumors less than or equal to 1 cm \ncompared to those with HER2- negative tumors of the same size.\n399  \n \nTen-year breast cancer -specific survival and 10 -year recurrence- free \nsurvival were 85% and 75%, respectively, in patients with tumors characterized as HER2- positive, ER -positive tumors, and 70% and 61%, \nrespectively, in patients with HER2- positive, ER -negative tumors. Two \nadditional retrospective series report recurrence- free survival in this \nsubpopulation of HER- 2 positive, node -negative tumors measuring 0.6 to \n1.0 cm (T1b) and /or pN1mi . all treated without trastuzumab. In the first \nstudy, 5- year recurrenc e-free survival rates of 77.1% and 93.7% ( P < \n.001) were observed for patients with HER2- positive and HER2- negative \nT1a-bN0M0 breast tumors, respectively, with no recurrence -free survival \ndifferences seen in the HER2- positive group when hormonal receptor \nstatus was considered.\n400 In the other retrospective study of patients with \nsmall HER2 -positive tumors, the risk of recurrence at 5 years was low \n(99% [95% CI; 96% –100%] for HER2 -negative disease and 92% [95% CI; \n86%–99%] for HER2- positive disease).401 Subgroup analyses from several \nof the randomized trials have shown consistent benefit of trastuzumab irrespective of tumor size or nodal status.\n402,403 \n Preferred Regimens : \nThe NCCN Panel has included paclitaxel and trastuzumab as an option for patients with low -risk, HER2 -positive, stage 1 tumors , based on a trial of \n406 patients with small, node- negative, HER2- positive tumors treated with \nthis combination. The 3 -year rate of DFS was 98.7% (95% CI, 97.6–99.8) \nand the risk of serious toxic effects with this regimen was low (incidence of heart failure reported was 0.5%).404 The long- term follow- up data  reported \n10-year invasive DFS of 91.3%, breast cancer -specific survival of 98.8% \nand OS rates of 94.3%.405 Accordingly,  NCCN panel has listed paclitaxel \nand trastuzumab as a less intensive therapeutic option,  preferred for \npatients with low -risk T1,N0,M0, HER2 -positive disease, particularly those \nnot eligible for other standard adjuvant regimens due to comorbidities.405 \nThe BCIRG 006 study randomized 3222 patients with HER2- positive, \nnode- positive, or high- risk node- negative breast cancer to AC followed by \ndocetaxel; AC followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab for one year; or \ncarboplatin, docetaxel, and trastuzumab for one year.403 At 65 -month \nfollow- up, patients receiving AC followed by docetaxel with trastuzumab \n(AC-TH) had an HR for DFS of 0.64 ( P < .001) when compared with the \ngroup of patients in the control arm receiving the same chemotherapy regimen without trastuzumab (AC- T). The HR for DFS was 0.75 ( P = .04) \nwhen patients in the carboplatin/docetaxel/ trastuzumab (TCH) -containing \narm were compared to patients in the control arm. No statistically \nsignificant difference in the HR for DFS was observed between the two trastuzumab- containing arms. An OS advantage was reported for patients \nin both trastuzumab- containing arms relative to the control arm (HR for \nAC-TH vs. AC -T = 0.63; P = .001; HR for TCH vs. AC -T = 0.77; P = .04). \nCardiac toxicity was significantly lower in the TCH arm (9.4% patients with >10% relative decline in left ventricular ejection fraction) compared with \nthe AC -TH arm (18.6%; P < .0001). CHF was also more frequent with \nAC-TH than TCH (2% vs. 0.4%; P  < .001).

No statistically significant differences in OS (HR, 0.41; 95% \nCI, 0.16 –1.08; P = .07) or cardiac toxicity were observed with the addition \nof trastuzumab.\n406 At 5-year follow -up, a comparison of the two arms (ie, \nchemotherapy with and without trastuzumab) demonstrated that the HRs for distant DFS (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38– 1.12; P = .12) and OS (HR, 0.55; \n95% CI, 0.27– 1.11; P = .094) were higher relative to those reported at 3 \nyears.\n407  The TCH regimen is a preferred regimen, especially for those \nwith risk factors for cardiac toxicity, based on the results of the BCIRG 006 study .  \nThe APHINITY trial compared adjuvant trastuzumab plus pertuzumab with trastuzumab– placebo, both in combination with standard adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with node -positive or high- risk node- negative \nHER2 -positive, operable tumors. The study demonstrated that \ntrastuzumab plus pertuzumab significantly improved 3- year iDFS (HR \n0.81, 95% CI 0.66 -1.00,  P =.045).\n408 With long -term (8 -year) follow -up, the \nnode positive subgroup maintained a clear invasive DFS benefit favoring  \nthe dual HER -2 agent arm demonstrating 8- year invasive DFS of 86% \nversus 81% (HR; 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 -0.87) with no OS  difference ; no \nbenefit was seen in the node- negative subgroup.409 These updated results \nfrom the adjuvant APHINITY trial  confirm the long- term benefit of adding \npertuzumab to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy for node positive disease.  \nThe panel has designated use of trastuzumab with chemotherapy as a \ncategory 1 recommendation for all HER2 -positive tumors > 1 cm , and \nbased on the data above, chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and \npertuzumab as a category 1, preferred regimen  for all HER- 2 positive,  \nnode- positive disease . The data from the phase III KATHERINE trial reported improved outcomes in patients who had residual invasive cancer and received adjuvant \ntrastuzumab emtansine (T- DM1). Invasive  DFS at 3 years was 88.3% with \nT-DM1 versus 77.0% with trastuzumab.\n410 T-DM1 significantly decreased \nthe invasive breast cancer  recurrence risk  or death (HR 0.50, 95% CI \n0.39- 0.64, P < .001).410 \nThe ATEMPT trial was designed to determine whether T- DM1 was more \ntoxic than paclitaxel/Trastuzumab.  The long- term followup data of patients \nwho received 1 year of adjuvant T- DM1 (n = 383) or \ntrastuzumab/paclitaxel (n = 114)  reported the 5 -year invasive disease free \nsurvival rate with T -DM1 of 97.0% (95% CI, 95.2% -98.7%), the 5- year \nrecurrence- free interval of 98.3% (95% CI, 96.3% -99.0%), and the 5 -year \nOS rate of 97.8% (95% CI, 96.3% -99.3%).411 The study was not powered \nto evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel/trastuzumab, among those who \nreceived it, the reported 5- year invasive disease -free survival with this \ncombination was 91.3% (95% CI: 86.0 -96.9%), 5- year recurrence free \ninterval was 93.3% (95% CI: 88.6 -98.2%) and 5- year OS was 97.9% (95% \nCI: 95.2 -100%).411 Based on these data, T- DM1 may be considered an \nalternative for these patients ineligible for paclitaxel/Trastuzumab.   \nOther recommended regimens :  \nAnthracycline followed by taxane -containing chemotherapy regimens were \nused in the NSABP trial B -31,412 NCCTG trial,413 and BCIRG 006 trial.403 \nIn the NOAH trial, patients were given concurrent taxane and \nanthracycline, then taxane alone followed by cyclophosphamide–\nmethotrexate– fluorouracil.414  In the FinHER patients were randomized to \ndocetaxel or vinorelbine before anthracyclines,406  and PACS 04 \nrandomized patients to fluorouracil /epirubicin/ cyclophosphamide or to \nepirubicin plus docetaxel.415 The  HERA trial did not mandate the choice of \nchemotherapy, 94% receiving anthracyclines and 26% receiving a taxane \nin addition to an anthracycline.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-50 \nAll of the above adjuvant trials of trastuzumab have demonstrated \nclinically significant improvements in DFS . Furthermore,  the HERA trial416 \nand the combined analysis of the NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 trials417 \nshowed significant improvement in OS with the use of trastuzumab. A \nmore recent meta -analysis of all the above (excluding the BCIRG 006 \nTrial) showed that addition of trastuzumab resulted in an average absolute reduction in 10- year risk of recurrence of 9.0% (95% CI 7.4 to 10.7; P < . \n0001), a reduction in 10- year breast cancer mortality by 6.4% (4.9 to 7.8; \nP < .0001), and a reduction in mortality (all causes) by 6 .5% (5.0 to 8.0;  P \n<.0001).\n418 The benefits of trastuzumab are independent of ER \nstatus.412,419   \nThe NCCN Panel considers it reasonable to incorporate pertuzumab into \nthe above adjuvant regimens272,420,421 \nThe results of theTRAIN- 2 trial showed high pCR rates after treatment \nregimen with anthracycline plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab (67%) and \nalso without anthracycline plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab (68%).420 \nPatients who received anthracycline- containing regimen experienced more \nfebrile neutropenia, hypokalemia, and left ventricular ejection fraction \n(LVEF) decline to grade 2 or worse (≥10% or to <50%).420  \nA follow- up analysis of the TRAIN -2 study showed similar 3 -year EFS and \nOS with or without anthracyclines in patients with stage II and III  HER2 - \npositive breast cancer. Based on these results, considering the added \ntoxicity of anthracycline containing regimens the panel has added non-\nanthracycline containing regimens with trastuzumab and pertuzumab as \ntreatment options.422  \nThe NCCN panel has included the following regimen as other \nrecommended regimens for HER2- positive disease:  \ndoxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by docetaxel + trastuzumab (followed by docetaxel + trastuzumab); AC followed by docetaxel + trastuzumab + pertuzumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin + trastuzumab + \npertuzumab.  \nRegimens Useful in Certain Circumstances:  \nOne year of extended therapy with neratinib after completion of 1 year of \nadjuvant trastuzumab without pertuzumab was evaluated in the phase III \nExteNET trial.  Neratinib improved invasive DFS (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 -\n0.92, P = .0083) primarily in the subgroup of HR -positive tumors (HR 0.60, \n95% CI 0.43 -0.83, P = .063).  Neratinib is associated with moderate to \nsevere diarrhea.  \nBased on the trials listed in the section for “other recommended regimen \nand the above data from ExteNET, the NCCN panel has included following \nregimens have been included as useful in certain circumstances: Docetaxel + cyclophosphamide + trastuzumab; AC followed by paclitaxel \n+ trastuzumab followed by paclitaxel plus trastuzumab, various \nschedules); AC followed by paclitaxel + trastuzumab + pertuzumab, \nvarious schedules); Paclitaxel + trastuzumab + pertuzumab;  adjuvant \nneratinib and adjuvant T -DM1 . \nTherapeutic duration and Other Considerations in those receiving HER2-\ntargeted therapy  \nThe length of trastuzumab administration in the adjuvant setting trials \nlisted above is 12 months.\n The HERA trial demonstrated no additional \nbenefit extending trastuzumab to 2 years compared with 1 year.  \nWith respect to a duration less than 12 months, t he results of the \nPERSEPHONE trial showed non -inferiority for 6 months versus 12 months \nof trastuzumab treatment,423 However, the PHARE study observed more \nevents in the 6 month cohort compared to the 12 month cohort, and non-\ninferiority was not established.424 Furthermore, adverse events over time PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

Based on the updated APHINITY trial data, the \naddition of pertuzumab may be considered with trastuzumab in those with \nnode- positive disease.  \nIncreased c ardiac toxicity  has been observed in patients treated with \ntrastuzumab.\n412,425,426 In addition, anthracycline  and taxane -based \nregimens in combination with HER2 -targeted agents are  associated with \nfurther increased risk of cardiac toxicity.427  The  panel recommends \nevaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prior to and during \ntreatment. The optimal frequency of LVEF assessment during adjuvant \ntrastuzumab therapy is not known. The FDA label recommends LVEF \nmeasurements prior to initiati on of trastuzumab and every 3 months during \ntherapy.  \nAccording to the panel, use of a FDA -approved biosimilar is an \nappropriate substitute for trastuzumab. Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase -\noysk injection approved for subcutaneous use may be substituted for  \nintravenous  trastuzumab. It is important to note that it has a different \ndosage and administration compared to intravenous trastuzumab.  \nAdjuvant Therapy for Tumors of Favorable Histologies   \nThe guidelines provide systemic treatment recommendations for the \nfavorable histology  of invasive breast cancers  (including pure tubular and \npure mucinous  cancers , pure cribriform , adenoid cystic secretory \ncarcinoma and other salivary carcinoma, rare low -grade forms of \nmetaplastic carcinoma) based on ER/PR status, tumor size and ALN  status . If used, the treatment options for endocrine therapy, \nchemotherapy, and sequencing of treatment with other modalities are \nsimilar to those of the usual histology of breast cancers. There are rare \nsubtypes of metaplastic carcinoma (eg, low -grade  adenosquamous and \nlow-grade fibromatosis -like carcinoma) that have a favorable prognosis \neven without administration of adjuvant systemic therapies.  \nThe vast majority of pure tubular , pure mucinous, and pure cribriform \nbreast cancers are both ER-positive and HER2- negative.  To be \nassociated with favorable prognosis, the favorable histologic type should \nnot be high grade, should be pure (>90% as classified on the surgical \nexcision, not core biopsy alone), and should be HER -2 negative. If atypical \npathologic or clinical features are present, consider treating as ductal/NST.  \nThe pathology evaluation and accuracy of the ER  and/or HER2 \ndetermination should be reviewed if these are ER -negative and/or \nHER2 -positive, or if a tumor with an ER - and PR -negative status is grade \n1.276 Should a breast cancer be histologically identified as a pure tubular or \nmucinous breast cancer and be confirmed as ER -negative, then the tumor \nshould be treated according to the guideline for the usual histology, \nER-negative breast cancers.

Patients should wait 6 to 12 months \nafter the completion of RT  to begin their annual mammogram surveillance.  \nSuspicious findings on physical examination or surveillance imaging might \nwarrant a shorter interval between mammograms. ”  \nThe NCCN P anel notes that any imaging of reconstructed breast is not \nindicated.  \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of recurrent disease, laboratory or imaging studies \nto screen for metastasis are not necessary. The routine performance of \nalkaline phosphatase tests and LFTs  are not included in the g uidelines .\n429-\n431 In addition, the Panel notes no evidence to support the use of “tumor \nmarkers” for breast cancer, and routine bone scans, CT scans, MRI scans, PET scans, or ultrasound examinations in the asymptomatic patient \nprovide no advantage in survival or ability to palliate recurrent disease and \nare, therefore, not recommended.\n110,432 \nThe use of breast MRI in follow- up of patients with prior breast cancer is \nundefined. It may be considered as an option in patients  with high lifetime \nrisk ( >20% based on models largely dependent on family history) of developing a second primary breast cancer. Rates of contralateral breast  \ncancer after either breast -conserving therapy or mastectomy have been \nreported to be increased in patients  with BRCA1/2  mutations when \ncompared with patients with sporadic breast cancer .433-435   \nThe Panel recommends that patients  with intact uteri who are taking \nadjuvant tamoxifen should have yearly gynecologic assessments and \nrapid evaluation of any vaginal spotting that might occur because of the \nrisk of tamoxifen- associated endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal \npatients.436 The performance of routine endometrial biopsy or \nultrasonography in the asymptomatic woman is not recommended. Neither \ntest has demonstrated utility as a screening test in any population of \npatients . The vast majority of patients  with tamoxifen -associated uterine \ncarcinoma have early vaginal spotting.   \nIf an adjuvant AI is considered in patients  with amenorrhea following \ntreatment, baseline levels of estradiol and gonadotropin followed by serial \nmonitoring of these hormones should be performed if endocrine therapy \nwith an AI  is initiated .330 Bilateral oophorectomy assures postmenopausal \nstatus in young patients  with therapy -induced amenorrhea and may be \nconsidered prior to initiating therapy with an AI  in a young woman.  \nSymptom management for patients  on adjuvant endocrine therapies often \nrequires treatment of hot flashes and the treat ment of concurrent \ndepression. Venlafaxine, a serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor \n(SNRI) , has been studied and is an effective intervention in decreasing hot \nflashes.332-335 There is evidence suggest ing that concomitant use of \ntamoxifen with certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) (eg, \nparoxetine, fluoxetine) may decrease plasma levels of endoxifen, an active \nmetabolite of tamoxifen .336,337 These SSRIs /SNRIs  may interfere with the \nenzymatic conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen by inhibiting a particular \nisoform of CYP2D6 .

Predictors of poor \nadherence to medication include the presence of side effects associated \nwith the medication, and incomplete understanding by the patient of the \nbenefits associated with regular administration of the medication.437 The \nPanel recommends the implementation of simple strategies to enhance \npatient adherence to endocrine therapy, such as direct questioning of the patient during office visits, as well as brief, clear explanations on the value \nof taking the medication regularly and the therapeutic importance of longer \ndurations of endocrine therapy .  \nLymphedema is a common complication after treatment for breast cancer.  Factors associated with increased risk of lymphedema include \nextent of axillary surgery, axillary radiation, infection, and patient obesity.\n438,439 The Panel recommends educating the patients on \nlymphedema, monitoring for lymphedema, and  referring for lymphedema \nmanagement as needed.  \nMany young patients treated for breast cancer maintain or regain \npremenopausal status following treatment for breast cancer. For these \npatients, the NCCN Panel discourages the use of hormonal birth control \nmethods, regardless of the HR status of the tumor.440 Alternative birth \ncontrol methods are recommended, including intrauterine devices, barrier \nmethods, and, for those with no intent of future pregnancy, tubal ligation or \nvasectomy. Breastfeeding during endocrine or chemotherapy treatment is \nnot recommended  by the NCCN Panel because of risks to the infant. \nBreastfeeding after breast -conserving treatment for breast cancer is not \ncontraindicated. However, lactation from an irradiated breast may not be \npossible, or may occur only with a diminished capacity.440,441  The Panel recommends that patients  on an adjuvant AI  or who experience \novarian failure secondary to treatment should have monitoring of bone \nhealth with a bone mineral density determination at baseline and \nperiodically thereafter . The use of estrogen, progesterone, or selective ER  \nmodulators to treat osteoporosis or osteopenia in patients  with breast \ncancer is discouraged. The use of a bisphosphonate is generally the \npreferred intervention to improve bone mineral density.  A single phase 3 \nstudy, ABCSG12, d emonstrated improved outcomes with the addition of \nzoledronic acid in premenopausal patients  receiving  endocrine therapy \nwith ovarian suppression.442 Use of bisphosphonates in such patients and \nin other subgroups remains controversial.  Denosumab has shown to \nsignificantly reduce  fractures in postmenopausal patients  receiving \nadjuvant therapy AIs , and improves bone mineral density .378  \nOptimal duration of bisphosphonate therapy has not been established. \nFactors to consider for duration of anti -osteoporosis therapy include bone \nmineral density, response to therapy, and risk factors for continued bone loss or fracture. Patients  treated with a bisphosphonate should undergo a \ndental examination with preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of \ntherapy, and should take supplemental calcium and vitami n D. \nEvidence suggests that a healthy lifestyle may lead to better breast cancer outcomes. A nested case control study of 369 patients with ER -positive  \ntumors who developed a second primary breast cancer compared with \n734 matched control patients who did not develop a second primary tumor \nshowed an association between obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30), \nsmoking, and alcohol consumption and contralateral breast cancer.\n443 A \nprospective study of 1490 patients diagnosed with stage I –III breast \ncancer showed an association between high fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and improved survivorship, regardless of \nobesity.\n444 There is emerging evidence that obesity is associated with  \npoorer outcomes for certain subtypes of breast cancers.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-55 \nRecurrent/Stage IV Breast Cancer  \nStaging and Workup for Recurrent and Stage IV Breast Cancer  \nThe staging evaluation of patients  who present with recurrent  or stage IV  \nbreast cancer includes : history and physical exam ination;  the performance \nof a CBC, LFTs , chest diagnostic CT, bone scan,  and radiographs of any \nlong or weight -bearing bones that are painful or appear abnormal on bone \nscan ; diagnostic CT of the abdomen (with or without diagnostic CT of the \npelvis)  or MRI scan of the abdomen ; and biopsy documentation of first \nrecurrence if possible.  The NCCN Panel generally discourages the use of \nsodium fluoride PET or PET/CT scans for the evaluation of patients with \nrecurrent disease.  There is li mited evidence (mostly from retrospective \nstudies) to support the use of PET/CT scanning to guide treatment planning through determination of the extent of disease in select patients \nwith recurrent or metastatic disease.\n110,111,449,450 In general, the \nnon-diagnostic CT scans used for PET under -evaluate the lungs and the \nliver compared with contrast -enhanced diagnostic CT scans. The Panel \nconsiders biopsy of equivocal or suspicious sites to be more likely than \nPET/CT scanning to provide accurate staging information in this patient  \npopulation.   \nThe consensus of the  NCCN Panel is that FDG -PET/CT is optional and \nmost helpful in situations  where standard imaging results are equivocal or \nsuspicious. The NCCN Panel recommends bone scan or sodium fluoride \nPET/CT (category 2B) to detect bone metastases. However, if the FDG -\nPET results clearly indicate bone metastas es, these scans can be omitted.   \nThe NCCN Panel recommends that metastatic disease at presentation or \nfirst recurrence of disease should be biopsied a s a part of the workup for \npatients with recurrent or stage IV disease. This ensures accurate \ndetermination of metastatic/recurrent disease and  tumor histology , and \nallows for biomarker determination  and selection of appropriate treatment.  \nSoft tissue tumor biopsy is preferred over bone sites unless a portion of the biopsy can be protected from harsh decalcification solution to preserve more accurate  biomarker  assessment.  \nDetermination of HR status ( ER and PR ) and HER2 status should be \nrepeated  in all cases when diagnostic tissue is obtained.  ER and PR \nassays may be falsely negative or falsely positive, and there may be \ndiscordance between the primary and metastatic tumors .\n451,452 The \nreasons for the discordance may relate to change in biology of disease, \ndifferential effect of prior treatment on clonal subsets, tumor heterogeneity, \nor imperfect accuracy and reproducibility of assays.452 Discordance \nbetween the receptor status of primary and recurrent disease has been \nreported in a number of studies . The discordance rates are in the range of \n3.4% to 60% for ER -negative to ER -positive; 7.2% to 31% for ER -positive \nto ER -negative; and 0.7% to 11% for HER2 .453- 462  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends that re -testing the receptor status of \nrecurrent disease be performed, especially  in cases when it was \npreviously unknown, originally negative, or not overexpressed.  For \npatients with clinical courses consistent with HR– positive breast cancer, or \nwith prior positive HR results, the Panel has noted that a course of \nendocrine therapy is reasonable,  regardless of  whether the receptor assay \nis repeated or  the result of the most recent HR assay.  \nGenetic counseling is recommended if the patient is considered to be at \nhigh risk for hereditary breast cancer , as defined by the NCCN Guidelines \nfor Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast , Ovarian, and \nPancreatic .  \nGenetic testing: In the metastatic setting, results from genetic testing may \nhave therapeutic implications. Germline mutations in BRCA1/2  have \nproven clinical utility and therapeutic impact. Therefore , germline BRCA1/2  \nmutations should be assessed in all patients with recurrent or metastatic  \nbreast cancer to identify candidates for  PARP inhibitor therapy .

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-56 \nManagement of Local ly Recurrent  Disease  \nPatients with local recurrence only are divided into three groups: 1) those \nwho had been treated initially by mastectomy  alone;  2) those who had \nbeen treated initially by  mastectomy  plus RT; and 3) those who had \nreceived breast -conserving therapy  plus RT. \nIn one retrospective study of local recurrence patterns in patients with \nbreast cancer who had undergone mastectomy and adjuvant \nchemotherapy without RT , the most common sites of local recurrence \nwere at the chest wall and the supraclavicular lymph nodes.463 The \nrecommendations for treatment of the population of patients experiencing \na local recurrence only are supported by analyses of a combined database \nof patients from the EORTC 10801 and Danish Breast Cancer \nCooperative Group 82TM trials. The analyses com pared \nbreast -conserving therapy with mastectomy in patients with stage I and \nstage II disease. The 133 (approximately 8%) patients experiencing a local \nrecurrence as an initial event were approximately equally divided between \nthose who had undergone mastec tomy and those who had received \nbreast -conserving therapy as initial treatment for breast cancer. Of those \nin the former group, 51 (76%) were able to undergo RT  with or without \nsurgery as treatment for local disease recurrence. No difference in survival emerged between patients receiving treatment after initial treatment with \nmastectomy or breast -conserving therapy; approximately 50% of both \ngroups were alive at 10 -year follow -up.\n464  \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, m astectomy -treated patients should \nundergo surgical resection of the local recurrence (if it can be \naccomplished with limited morbidity ) and involved -field RT to the chest \nwall and supraclavicular area (if the chest wall was not previously treated \nor if additional RT  may be safely administered). The use of surgical \nresection in this setting implies the use of limited excision of disease with the goal of obtaining clear margins of resection. Unresectable chest wall recurrent disease should be treated with RT  if no prior radiation has been \ngiven.  \nIn patients  with a local breast recurrence after BCS  and RT who had a \nprior sentinel  lymph  node (SLN) biopsy, a repeat S LNB may be \nconsidered although  the accuracy  of repeat S LNB is unproven, and the \nprognostic significance of repeat S LNB after mastectomy is unknown and \nits use is discouraged .\n465,466 On the other hand, the prognostic significance \nof repeat S LNB after mastectomy is unknown and its use is discouraged . \nThe consensus recommendation of the P anel for most patients with a local \nrecurrence following breast -conserving therapy and SLN B is mastectomy \nand a level I/II axillary dissection.  \nThe results of the CALOR trial found that  after complete resection in \npatients with isolated locoregional recurrence , adjuvant chemotherapy \nimproves both DFS  and OS.467 After a median follow -up of 4.9 years, the \noverall DFS  was 69% in the chemotherapy group versus 57% in the group \nthat did not receive chemotherapy (HR , 0.59; P = .046).467 Five-year OS in \nall patients in the study was also significantly improved with chemotherapy \n(88% vs. 76%,  P = .024).467 The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was \nmostly seen in patients with ER -negative disease. Among patients  with \nER-negative disease, 5 -year DFS was 67% versus 35% (HR , 0.32; 95% \nCI, 0.14–0.73) and in those ER -positive disease, the 5- year DFS was 70% \nversus 69% (HR , 0.94; 95% CI , 0.47–1.89) .467 However these patients \nreceived endocrine therapy.  \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, after local treatment, patients  with local \nrecurrences only should be considered for limited duration systemic \nchemotherapy or endocrine therapy similar to that outlined in the adjuvant \nchemotherapy section. The Panel emphasized the importance of \nindividualizing treatment strategies in patients with a recurrence of disease  \nlimited to a local site.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-57 \nManagement of  Recurrent or Stage IV D isease  \nFrom the time of diagnosis of recurrent/stage IV metastatic disease, \npatients should be offered appropriate supportive care and \nsymptom- related interventions as a routine part of their care. NCCN \nrecognizes the importance of clinical trials and encourages participation \nwhen applicable and available.   \nSurgery  for Recurrent or Stage IV D isease  \nThe primary treatment approach recommended by the NCCN Panel for \npatients with metastatic breast cancer and an intact primary tumor is \nsystemic therapy, with consideration of surgery after initial systemic \ntreatment for those requiring palliation of sympto ms or with impending \ncomplications, such as skin ulceration, bleeding, fungation, and pain.468 \nGenerally such surgery should be undertaken only if complete local \nclearance of tumor may be obtained and if other sites of disease are not \nimmediately  life-threatening. Alternatively, RT  may be considered instead \nof surgery. Often such surgery requires collaboration between the breast \nsurgeon and the reconstructive surgeon to provide optimal cancer control \nand wound closure.   \nRetrospective studies suggest a potential survival benefit from complete \nexcision of the in -breast tumor in select patients with metastatic breast \ncancer .469-472 Substantial selection biases exist in all of these studies and \nare likely to confound the study results .473,474  \nTwo prospective, randomized studies assessed whether or not surgery on \nthe primary tumor in the breast is necessary for patients  who are \ndiagnosed with metastatic/stage IV breast cancer.475,476 In the first \nprospective trial, patients (n =  350) with de  novo metastatic breast cancer \nwho achieved a partial or complete response to anthracycline- based \nchemotherapy were randomly assigned to either surgery of the primary \ntumor plus adjuvant radiation or  no locoregional treatment.475 There was no difference in the OS between the group that received surgery and the \ngroup that did not (19.2 vs. 20.5 months ; HR, 1.04; 95% CI , 0.81– 1.34).475 \nIn a separate mult icenter prospective registry study patients whose \ndisease responded to first -line systemic therapy were randomized to \nmanagement of the primary tumor by surgery or not.  477 Preliminary data \nshowed no difference in OS between the two groups  477  \nHowever, in another trial by the Turkish Federation ( MF07- 01), patients (n \n= 274) with de novo metastatic breast cancer who were randomized to \nlocal management (mastectomy, or BCS with radiation) followed by \nsystemic therapy versus systemic therapy only observed a benefit with \nsurgery.478 While no difference in survival was seen at 36 months, at 40 \nmonths, patients treated with local management showed an improvement \nin survival with locoregional treatment (46.4% vs. 26.4%; HR , 0.66; 95% \nCI, 0.49–0.88).478 The design of this trial is  different from the other , the first \ndifference being the inclusion of two prospective studies described above \nin which patients were included only if they had experienced a response to \nsystemic therapy.  Second, randomization in the Turkish trial was not \nbalanced. Patients who received surgery had lower rates of triple- negative \ndisease (7% vs. 17%), visceral metastases (29% vs. 45%), and many had \nsolitary bone metastases only (33% vs. 20%).478 In an unplanned \nsubgroup analysis, patients who appeared to derive the greatest OS \nbenefit from local management included those with HR- positive  disease \n(HR, 0.63; 95% CI , 0.44– 0.89; P = .008) ; those with HER2 -negative \ndisease (HR, 0.64; 95% CI , 0.45–0.91; P = .01) ; those <55 years  (HR, \n0.57; 95% CI , 0.38–0.86; P = .007 ); and those with solitary bone \nmetastases (HR, 0.47; 95% CI , 0.23–0.98;  P = .04). 478 \nThe Panel recognizes the need for more data from randomized clinical \ntrials that will address the risks and benefits of local therapy for patients with stage IV disease while eliminating selection biases.

In such clinical scenarios, patient \nengagement in the decision is encouraged.   \nGuideline Stratification  for Systemic T herapy for Stage IV/Recurrent \nDisease  \nThe systemic treatment of breast cancer recurrence or stage IV disease \nprolongs survival and enhances QOL  but is not curative. Therefore, \ntreatments associated with minimal toxicity are preferred. Thus, the use of \nthe minimally toxic endocrine therapies is preferred to the use of cytotoxic \ntherapy whenever reasonable.479 Guidance for treatment of patients with \nbreast cancer and brain metastases is included the NCCN Guidelines for \nCentral Nervous System  Cancers . \nPatients with recurrent or stage IV breast cancer at diagnosis are initially \nstratified according to whether bone metastases are present . These two \npatient subsets (those with and without bony metastases) are then further \nstratified by tumor HR and HER2 stat us. \nTherapy for Bone M etastases  \nComplications from bone metastases include pain, decreased \nperformance status, and decreased QOL, as well as skeletal -related \nevents (SREs), which are defined as the need for radiation or surgery to \nbone, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of \nmalignancy.   \nThe NCCN Panel recommends treatment with a bone- modifying agent \nsuch as zoledronic acid, pamidronate , or denosumab (category 1) in \naddition to chemotherapy or endocrine therapy if bone metastasis is present ; expected survival is ≥3 months. Patients should undergo a dental \nexamination with preventive dentistry prior to initiation of this therapy. The bisphosphonates and denosumab are associated with a risk of \ndevelopment of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Poor baseline dental health or dental procedures during treatment are known risk factors for ONJ. Thus, a dental examination with preventive dentistry intervention is \nrecommended prior to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate or \ndenosumab, and dental procedures  invasive of gum or bone  during \ntreatment should be avoided if at all possible. Additional risk factors for the development of ONJ include administration of chemotherapy or \ncorticosteroids and poor oral hygiene with periodontal disease and dental \nabscess.\n480   \nBisphosphonates  \nThere are extensive data from randomized trials in support of the use of bisphosphonates for patients with metastatic disease to bone. The \nrandomized clinical trial data include the use of zoledronic  acid and \npamidronate in the United States  and ibandronate and clodronate in \nEuropean countries .\n481- 488 In metastatic bone disease, bisphosphonate \ntreatment is associated with fewer SREs , fewer pathologic fractures, and \nless need for RT and surgery to treat bone pain.  \nThe use of bisphosphonates in metastatic disease is a palliative care \nmeasure. No impact on OS has been observed in patient s treated with \nbisphosphonates.   \nThe data indicate that zoledronic acid and pamidronate may be given on a \n3- to 4-week schedule in conjun ction with antineoplastic therapy (ie,  \nendocrine therapy, chemotherapy , biologic therapy) or every 12 weeks .  \nThree randomized trials have compared zoledronic acid dosed every 4 \nweeks versus every 12 weeks.489- 491 Data from these trials show that  \namong patients  with breast cancer and bone metastases zoledronic acid \nadministered once every 12 weeks versus once every 4 weeks does not \ncompromise efficacy  and has similar rates of SREs.489,490,492 In the ZOOM \ntrial,489 the rate of skeletal morbidities was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.14– 0.29) in \nthose receiving zoledronic acid every 4 weeks versus 0.26 (95% CI, 0.15–0.37) in those receiving zoledronic acid every 12 weeks.

In OPTIMIZE -2 trial,491 the rate of SREs was \n22% in the 4 -week arm and 23.2% in the 12 -week arm.491 The NCCN \nPanel recommends an optimal dosing of every 12 weeks.  \nThe use of bisphosphonates should be accompanied by calcium and \nvitamin D supplementation with daily doses of calcium of 1200 to 1500 mg \nand vitamin D 3 of 400 to 800 IU. Recommended agents for use in the \nUnited States are pamidronate 90  mg intravenously over 2 hours or \nzoledronic acid 4  mg intravenously over 15 minutes. The original studies \ncontinued treatment for up to 24 months; however, there are limited \nlong- term safety data indicating treatment can continue beyond t hat \ntime.484,486,493 The risk of renal toxicity necessitates  monitoring of serum \ncreatinine prior to administration of each dose and dose reduction or \ndiscontinuation if renal function is reduced. Current clinical trial results \nsupport the use of bisphosphonates for up to 2 years. Longer durations of \nbisphosphonate therapy may provide additional benefit, but this has not \nyet been tested in clinical trials.   \nDenosumab  \nPatients with metastatic breast cancer to bone who are candidates for \nbisphosphonate therapy may also be considered for treatment with \ndenosumab. This recommendation is based on the results of a single \nrandomized trial comparing denosumab to zoledronic aci d.494 All trial \npatients were recommended to supplement with vitamin D and calcium. Patients on the experimental arm were given 120 mg of denosumab \ninjected subcutaneously every 4 weeks plus intravenous placebo versus \nthe control arm where patients were given an intravenous infusion of 4 mg \nof zoledronic acid every 4 weeks, and a subcutaneous placebo. In this trial \nwith non- inferiority as the primary endpoint, denosumab was shown to \nsignificantly delay time to first SRE by 18% as compared with zoledronic \nacid (H R, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71– 0.95; P < .001 for non -inferiority ; P = .01 for superiority) and time to first and subsequent SREs (rate ratio, 0.77; 95% \nCI, 0.66 –0.89; P = .001). No difference in time to progression or OS was \nobserved.\n494 Dosing of denosumab outside of every 3  to 6 weeks has not \nbeen studied.  \nSystemic Therapy for Stage IV or Recurrent Metastatic HR -Positive, \nHER2 -Negative Breast Cancer  \nPatients with stage IV or recurrent disease characterized by HR -positive, \nHER2 -negative tumors with no visceral crisis are treated with endocrine \ntherapy alone or endocrine therapy in combination with targeted agents. \nPatients whose disease progresses after a year from the end of adjuvant \nendocrine- based therapy and those who present with de novo stage \nIV/metastatic breast cancer are eligible for first -line endocrine therapies .  \nMany premenopausal and postmenopausal patients  with HR-positive  \nbreast cancer benefit from sequential use of endocrine therapies at  \ndisease progression. Therefore, patients  with breast cancers whose \ndisease responds  to an endocrine- based  therapy  with either shrinkage of \nthe tumor or long- term disease stabilization (clinical benefit) should \nreceive additional endocrine therapy at disease progression.  For disease \nprogress ion on or within 12 months of completing adjuvant endocrine \ntherapy or for disease progression on first -line endocrine therapy for \nmetastatic disease, p atients  are eligible for second- line endocrine therapy \neither as monotherapy or in combination with a targeted agent. The \noptimal sequence for endocrine therapy is not well defined. The choice \nwould depend on previous tolerance of treatment and patient preference.   \nMany trials in HR- positive patients have not included premenopausal \npatients. The NCCN Panel recommends that patients with HR- positive \ndisease should have adequate ovarian suppression/ablation and then be \ntreated in the same way as postmenopausal patients. The NCCN P anel \nhas outlined endocrine- based therapies that would be used in the first -line \nversus second-  and subsequent -line settings.

At a median \nfollow- up of 26.4 months, an improvement in PFS (25.3 vs. 16.0 months; \nHR for progression or death was 0.56 ; 95% CI , 0.45– 0.70) and improved \nORR of 43% vs. 29% was seen with ribociclib plus letrozole compared with letrozole alone.\n496 Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more common \nwith the combination and included neutropenia (62% vs. 1.2%), \nleukopenia (21.3% vs. 0.9%), and abnormal LFTs  (10.2% vs. 2.4%).496  \nThe phase III MONARCH trial studied the combination of abemaciclib with either an AI (letrozole or anastrozole) or  AI monotherapy as first -line \ntreatment of patients with advanced HR -positive, HER2 -negative breast cancer. The combination of abemaciclib with the AI improved PFS, compared with the AI alone (median not reached vs . 14.7 months, \nrespectively; HR , 0.54; 95% CI , 0.41–0.72).\n497 The ORR was higher with \nthe combination compared with AI monotherapy (59% vs. 44 %).497 The \nmost frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events for abemaciclib versus placebo included diarrhea (9.5% vs.1.2%), neutropenia (21.1%  vs. 1.2%), \nleukopenia (8% vs. 0.6%) , and fatigue (2% vs. 0 %).\n497 \nMost trials studying CDK 4/6 inhibitor with an AI have mainly included \npostmenopausal patients and only a small subset of premenopausal \npatients on ovarian suppression. However, in the phase III \nMONALEESA- 7 trial, 672 pre - or perimenopausal patients with \nHR-positive, HER2 -negative advanced breast cancer were randomly \nassigned to first -line treatment with  ribociclib or placebo with goserelin \nplus either a nonsteroidal AI or tamoxifen.498 An improvement in PFS was \nseen with the addition of ribociclib (median PFS, 24 vs . 13 months; HR , \n0.55; 95% CI , 0.4–0.69).498  \nAt 3.5 years, an improvement in OS was reported with ribociclib (70% vs. 46%; HR , 0.71; 95% CI , 0.54– 0.95).\n499 Grade 3 and 4 adverse events \nreported in >10% of patients in either group included neutropenia (61% vs. \n4%) and leukopenia (14% vs. 1%) .498 \nBased on the above data , the NCCN P anel has included AI in combination \nwith CDK 4/6 inhibitors as a category 1 first -line option for \npostmenopausal patients  and premenopausal patients  with ovarian \nablation/suppression with HR- positive, HER2 -negative recurrent/stage IV  \nbreast cancer . \nSingle -Agent Fulvestrant:  Fulvestrant is an ER antagonist and was \noriginally approved as a monthly intramuscular injection (250 mg per month); higher dose has been proven to be more effective in subsequent \nrandomized trials.

The PFS was superior with the fulvestrant 500 mg regimen \n(HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68 –0.94; P = .006),\n503 indicating an increased \nduration of response with the higher dose of fulvestrant. The final analyses demonstrated an increase in median OS (4.1 months) and reduced risk of \ndeath (19%) with a dose of 500 mg compared with 250 mg. Median OS was 26.4 versus 22.3 months (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69– 0.96; P = .02).\n504  \nResults from another phase III trial (FALCON) of first -line treatment with \nfulvestrant compared with anastrozole in endocrine therapy -naïve patients  \nwith metastatic ER -positive breast cancer, demonstrated improved PFS \nwith fulvestrant (at the higher dose, 500 mg) over anastrozole at a median \nfollow- up of 25.0 months (16.6 vs. 13.8 months ; HR for progression or \ndeath, 0.797 ; 95% CI , 0.637– 0.999).505 The QOL outcomes were similar \nbetween the two groups, with the most common adverse effects being \narthralgia (17% vs. 10% ) and hot flashes (11% vs. 10%) for fulvestrant \nand anastrozole, respectively.505  \nFulvestrant + CDK 4/6 Inhibitor:  In the phase III trial , MONALEESA- 3, in \npatients (n = 726) with advanced HR -positive breast cancer who had no \nprior endocrine therapy or had disease progress ion on prior therapy, the combination of ribociclib with fulvestrant showed improved PFS versus \nfulvestrant alone (21 vs. 13 months; HR, 0.59; 95% CI , 0.48–0.73).506 The \nPFS benefits were  consistent across patients with and without prior \nendocrine treatment. In a subsequent analysis, a significant improvement \nin OS was observed.507 At 42 months the estimated OS was 57.8% (95% \nCI, 52.0 –63.2) in the ribociclib group and 45.9% (95% CI,  36.9–54.5) in \nthe placebo group.507 \nComparison across multiple trials, including those in the second -line \nsettings studying combination of fulvestrant with palbociclib or abemaciclib \nhave shown statistically significant improvement in PFS. Based  on the \nresults of the MONALEESA- 3 trial and extrapolation results from the \nsecond- line setting, the NCCN P anel has included fulvestrant in \ncombination with CDK 4/6 inhibitors as a category 1 first- line option for \npostmenopausal patients  and premenopausal patients  with ovarian \nablation/suppression  with HR- positive , HER2 -negative recurrent/stage IV  \nbreast cancer .  \nFulvestrant + Nonsteroidal AI : The combination of two  endocrine agents \nas first -line treatment in postmenopausal patients  with HR- positive, \nmetastatic breast cancer has been reported from studies comparing single -agent anastrozole versus anastrozole plus fulvestrant.  \nIn one study  (FACT ), combination of fulvestrant with anastrozole was not \nsuperior to single- agent anastrozole (time to progression HR, 0.99; 95% \nCI, 0.81–1.20; P = .91).\n508 In a second  phase III trial (SoFEA),  the effect of \nfulvestrant alone or in combination with anastrozole or exemestane was \nstudied in patients with advanced breast cancer with acquired resistance \nto a nonsteroidal AI.509 An AI had been given as adjuvant treatment to \n18% of patients for a median of 27.9 months, and to 82% of patients for \nlocally advanced/metastatic disease for a median of 19.3 months.

The three trials discussed above had slightly different patient \npopulations —there were more cases of patients with no prior endocrine \nexposure (with de novo stage IV metastatic disease) in the SWOG S0226 \ntrial compared with the FACT trial. The FACT trial included a more \nheterogeneous population of both premenopausal and postmenopausal \npatients  with locally advanced and metastatic disease. The SoFEA trial \nonly enrolled patients with acquired endocrine resistance (who had \ndisease progression while they were receiving an AI). Further studies are \nneeded to confirm the results of the SWOG S0226 trial.  \nThe NCCN Panel has included an AI and fulvestrant as first -line therapy \n(category 1) for postmenopausal patients based on the above data.  \nMonotherapy with Endocrine Agents : In postmenopausal patients  there is \nevidence support ing the use of an AI as  first-line therapy for their recurrent \ndisease.512,513  \nProspective randomized trials comparing the AI head- to-head have \ndemonstrated that all AIs are the same .514 Tamoxifen is the commonly \nused selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for premenopausal patients.515 In postmenopausal patients, AI monotherapy has been shown \nto have superior outcome compared with tamoxifen, although the \ndifferences are modest.516-520 A randomized phase III trial comparing \ntamoxifen with exemestane as first -line endocrine therapy for \npostmenopausal patients  with metastatic breast cancer showed no \nsignificant differences in PFS or OS between the two arms .518  \nNCCN recommendations for first -line therapy:  For postmenopausal \npatients with HR- positive, HER2 -negative recurrent/stage IV breast \ncancer, NCCN category 1, preferred regimens include a cyclin- dependent \nkinase  CDK 4/6 inhibitor with an AI; fulvestrant with or without a CDK 4/6 \ninhibitor; and fulvestrant with a nonsteroidal AI. The NCCN category 2A, \npreferred regimen includes nonsteroidal AI ( ie, anastrozole, letrozole); \nsteroidal AI (exemestane), and selective ER  modulator (tamoxifen or \ntoremifene). For premenopausal patients,  first-line endocrine treatment \nincludes ovarian suppression/ ablation and endocrine therapy listed  above \nfor postmenopausal patients or alternately with  a SERM alone.  \nPreferred Regimens for  Second and Subsequent  Line s of Therapy for \nHR-Positive, HER2 -Negative Breast Cancer  \nFulvestrant -Containing Regimens \nFulvestrant + CDK 4/6 Inhibitors : Fulvestrant  in combination with a CDK \n4/6 inhibitor  may be offered to patients who experienced disease \nprogression during prior treatment with AIs with or without one line of prior chemotherapy (category 1), because PFS was improved compared with \nfulvestrant alone in a phase III trial (PALOMA -3).\n521 The NCCN P anel \nnotes that treatment should be limited to those without  prior exposure to \nCDK 4/6 inhibitors . \nThe PALOMA -3 compared the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant \nto fulvestrant in pre - or postmenopausal patients with HR-positive, \nHER2 -negative advanced breast cancer, whose disease progressed on PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

The ORR was higher \nin those receiving abemaciclib and fulvestrant (48% vs. 21%).523 In \naddition, an improvement was seen in OS with abemaciclib plus \nfulvestrant compared with fulvestrant alone (46.7 vs . 37.3 months; HR , \n0.757; 95% CI , 0.606– 0.945).524  \nBased on the above data  that shows addition of a CDK 4/6 inhibitor to \nfulvestrant in patients previously exposed to prior endocrine therapy \nprovides a significant improvement in median PFS, the NCCN Panel has \nincluded fulvestrant  in combination with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor as a category \n1 option for postmenopausal patients  and premenopausal patients  with \novarian ablation/suppression with HR -positive, HER2 - negative , \nrecurrent/stage IV  breast cancer. The Panel notes  that if there is disease \nprogression while on CDK 4/6 inhibitor therapy, there are limited data to \nsupport an additional line of therapy with another CDK  4/6 \ninhibitor -containing regimen.  \nFulvestrant Monotherapy : Fulvestrant monotherapy appears to be at least \nas effective as anastrozole in patients whose disease progressed on previous tamoxifen.\n525,526 A randomized phase II study compared \nanastrozole versus fulvestrant in over 200 patients with advanced breast cancer.\n500,501 In the initial analysis, fulvestrant was as effective as \nanastrozole in terms of ORR (36.0% vs. 35.5%; OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.56–1.87;  P = .947) in evaluable patients (n  = 89 for fulvestrant and n  = 93 for \nanastrozole).500 An improved time to progression was seen with fulvestrant \ncompared to anastr ozole (median time to progression was 23.4 months for \nfulvestrant vs. 13.1 months for anastrozole; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39– 1.00; \nP = .0496).501 This study used a higher 500 mg loading dose every 2 \nweeks for 3 doses and then 500 mg monthly.500 The median OS was \nobserved to be longer in the fulvestrant group than in the anastrozole \ngroup (54.1 months vs. 48.4 months; HR, 0.70;  P = .041) .502  \nA phase II study of fulvestrant in postmenopausal patients  with advanced \nbreast cancer and disease progression following AI therapy documented a \npartial response rate of 14.3% with an additional 20.8% of patients \nachieving stable disease for at least 6 months.527 The clinical benefit rates \nof exemestane versus fulvestrant observed in a phase III trial of \npostmenopausal patients  with HR- positive advanced breast cancer who \nexperienced disease progression on prior nonsteroidal AI  therapy were \ncomparable (32.2% vs. 31.5%; P = .853).528 In that study, fulvestrant was \nadministered as a 500 mg loading dose followed by doses of 250 mg on \nday 14, day 28, and then monthly .528   \nFulvestrant Plus Alpelisib : In a randomized phase III trial , patients  (n = \n572) with advanced HR -positive breast cancer and confirmed PIK3CA \nstatus  had received a prior AI  either for local or advanced disease. \nPatients were enrolled into either  the PIK3CA mutant (n = 341) cohort or \nthe PIK3CA  non-mutant cohort and each cohort was randomized to \nreceive fulvestrant  plus the phosphoinositide 3- kinase (PI3K) inhibitor , \nalpelisib versus fulvestrant plus placebo.

In the overall population, \nthe most frequently reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events seen with \nalpelisib and fulvestrant versus fulves trant alone were hyperglycemia \n(36.6% vs.  0.7%) , rash (9.9% vs. 0.3%) , and diarrhea (6.7% vs. 0.3%)  \n(grade 3); no diarrhea or rash of grade 4 were  reported.529  \nEverolimus Plus Endocrine Therapy : Resistance to endocrine therapy in \npatients with HR- positive disease is frequent. One mechanism of \nresistance to endocrine therapy is activation of the mammalian target of \nrapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway.  \nA randomized phase II study estimated the efficacy of tamoxifen alone \nversus tamoxifen combined with everolimus, an oral inhibitor of mTOR , in \npatients  with HR- positive, HER2 -negative metastatic breast cancer \npreviously treated with an AI .530 After a median follow- up of 13 months, an \nintent -to-treat analysis showed that the clinical benefit was 42.1% (95% \nCI, 29.1 –55.9) with tamoxifen alone and 61.1% (95% CI, 46.9–74.1) with \ntamoxifen plus everolimus. An improvement in median time to progression \nwas seen when everolimus was combined with tamoxifen compared with \ntamoxifen alone. Median time to progression was 4.5 months (95% CI, \n3.7–8.7) with tamoxifen alone versus 8.5 months (95% CI, 6.01–13.9) with \neverolimus and tamoxifen.530  \nIn a phase III trial  in postmenopausal patients  with advanced, HR- positive \nbreast cancer with no prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease, randomized subjects to letrozole with or without the mTOR inhibitor \ntemsirolimus ,\n531 PFS was not different between the treatment arms ( HR, \n0.89; 95% CI , 0.75–1.05; log-rank P = .18).   \nThe results  of this trial differ from that of the BOLERO- 2 trial  (described \nbelow). The reasons for the differences in the outcomes of these two \nrandomized phase III studies531,532 is uncertain, but may be related to the \nissues of patient selection and extent of prior endocrine therapy.    A phase III study  (BOLERO -2) randomized  postmenopausal patients  with \nHR-positive advanced breast cancer that had disease progress ion or \nrecurrence during treatment with a nonsteroidal AI to exemestane with or \nwithout the mTOR inhibitor everolimus.533 Final results reported after \nmedian 18- month follow -up show that median PFS (by central review) \nremained significantly longer with everolimus plus exemestane versus placebo plus exemestane at 11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively (HR, \n0.38; 95% CI,  0.31–0.48; P < .0001).\n532 The adverse events (all grades) \nthat occurred more frequently in those receiving everolimus included \nstomatitis, inf ections, rash, pneumonitis, and hyperglycemia.532,533 Analysis \nof safety and efficacy i n the older  patients enrolled in this trial showed that \nolder  patients treated with an everolimus -containing regimen had similar \nincidences of these adverse events , but the younger patients had more \non-treatment deaths .534 Based on the evidence from the BOLERO -2 trial, \nthe NCCN Panel has included everolimus plus exemestane as an option for patients who fulfill the entry criteria for BOLERO -2. Tamoxifen or \nfulvestrant in combination with everolimus have also been included as options. The NCCN P anel also notes that if there is disease progression \nwhile on an everolimus -containing regimen, there are no data to support \nan additional line of therapy with another everolimus regimen.  \nAromatase Inhibitors : AIs as monotherapy are options as subsequent -line \ntherapy. The three AIs (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) have shown similar efficacy in the second -line setting.\n514,535,536 AI monotherapy \nmaybe be useful in patients desiring single- agent treatment, if they have \nnot received an AI as first -line treatment or  if they  may not be suitable for \ncombination therapy.

All may benefit by adding one of the following to fulvestrant: a \nCDK 4/6 -inhibitor, or an mTOR -inhibitor, or alpelisib, if the tumor has \nPIK3CA mutat ion. \nRegimens Useful i n Certain Circumstances for Therapy for HR -Positive, \nHER2 -Negative Breast Cancer  \nMegestrol acetate ,512,538- 540 estradiol541 androgens such as \nfluoxymesterone, and single- agent abemaciclib have been listed as \noptions useful in certain circumstances.  \nThe phase II MONARCH 1 trial evaluated the activity of abemaciclib as a \nsingle agent in patients (n =  132) with refractory HR- positive, \nHER2 -negative metastatic breast cancer  who had disease progress ion \nwhile  on endocrine therapy and already received multiple systemic \ntherapies (average of three prior systemic regimens) .542 Ninety percent of \npatients had visceral disease and 50.8% had more than three sites of \nmetastases.542 Single -agent abemaciclib induced a partial response in 26  \npatients  (19.7%) and demonstrated an ORR of 19.7% (95% CI , 13.3–\n27.5).542 Median PFS was 6 months (95% CI , 4.2–7.5). At the final analysis, at 18 months, median OS was 22.3 months (95% CI , 17.7–not \nreached).542 Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event  reported in \n90.2% of patients . Other common adverse events were fatigue  (65.2%) , \nnausea (64.4%) , and decreased appetite  (45.5%) . Grade  3 and 4 \nneutropenia occurred in 26.9% of patients.542 The NCCN P anel has \nincluded single- agent abemaciclib as an option for those with disease \nprogression on prior endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the \nmetastatic setting.  \nSystemic Therapy for Stage IV or Recurrent HR -Negative, HER2- Positive \nBreast Cancer  \nFor patients with HER2 -positive, HR- negative recurrent /stage IV breast \ncancer, the treatment approach is HER2- targeted therapy in combination \nwith systemic chemotherapy. The NCCN P anel notes that an \nFDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab. \nAlso, t rastuzumab and hyaluronidase- oysk injection for subcutaneous use \nmay be substituted for trastuzumab. This subcutaneous option has different dosage and administration instructions compared to intravenous \ntrastuzumab.  Doses and schedules of representative regimens for use in \nHER2 -positive metastatic breast cancer  are also included in NCCN \nGuidelines. \nPatients with disease progression while being treated with  HER2 -targeted \ntherapy should be offered an additional line of treatment with a \nHER2 -targeted therapy since it is beneficial to continue suppression of the \nHER2 pathway. The choice of the HER2- targeted therapy will depend on \npreviously administered therapy, relapse -free interval, and patients’ \npreference and access.  \nThe optimal sequence of available HER2- targeted therapies and the \noptimal duration of HER2- targeted therapy for recurrent/ stage IV  breast \ncancer is currently unknown. The NCCN P anel recommends continuing \nHER2 -targted therapy until progression/unacceptable toxicity.

At a median follow -up \nof 19 months, the addition of pertuzumab to docetaxel plus trastuzumab resulted in improvement in PFS compared with placebo (median, 18.5 vs . \n12.4 months; HR , 0.62; 95% CI , 0.51–0.75; P < .001).\n543 At a median \nfollow- up of 30 months the results showed a statistically significant \nimprovement in OS in favor of the pertuzumab -containing regimen, with a \n34% reduction in the risk of death (HR , 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 –0.84; P = \n.0008).544 The most common adverse reactions reported in the \npertuzumab group compared to the control group were diarrhea  (67% vs. \n46%), rash (34% vs. 24%),  mucosal inflammation (27% vs. 20%) , febrile \nneutropenia (14% vs. 8%),  and dry skin (10% vs. 4%) . Peripheral edema \nand constipation were greater in the control group.543 Cardiac adverse \nevents or left ventricular systolic dysfunction were reported slightly more \nfrequent ly in the control group.545 HRQOL  was not different in the two \ntreatment groups.546 In the PERUSE study, patients (n = 1436) with \nadvanced HER2- positive breast cancer and no prior systemic therapy \n(except endocrine therapy) received docetaxel, paclitaxel , or \nnab-paclitaxel with trastuzumab and pertuzumab until disease progression \nor unacceptable toxicity. The preliminary results after 52 months of median \nfollow- up show that median PFS was comparable between docetaxel, \npaclitaxel , and nab -paclitaxel (median PFS reported was  19.6, 23.0 , and \n18.1 months with docetaxel, paclitaxel , and nab -paclitaxel, respectively).547 \nCompared with docetaxel -containing therapy, paclitaxel -containing therapy \nwas associated with more neuropathy (31% vs. 16%), but less febrile neutropenia (1% vs. 11%) and mucositis (14% vs. 25%).  Phase II tr ials have also found activity and tolerability for pertuzumab, \npertuzumab with trastuzumab, and for other regimens combining \npertuzumab and trastuzumab together with other active cytotoxic agents  \n(ie, paclitaxel , vinorelbine).\n548,549 ,550 Phase III trials of pertuzumab plus \nchemotherapy without  trastuzumab have not been reported . \nThe NCCN Panel recommends pertuzumab plus trastuzumab in combination with a taxane as a preferred option for first -line treatment of \npatients with HER2 -positive metastatic breast cancer. Pertuzumab plus \ntrastuzumab in combination with docetaxel is an NCCN category 1 and in \ncombination with paclitaxel is an NCCN category 2A recommendation.  \nOther Regimens for Stage IV/Recurrent HER2- Positive Breast Cancer  \nAdo-trastuzumab emtansine (T- DM1): T-DM1 is an antibody -drug \nconjugate  that stably links the HER2 -target ing property of trastuzumab to  \nthe cytotoxi c activity of the microtubule- inhibitory agent DM1 (derivative of \nmaytansine).  \nIn a phase III trial (MARIANNE), 1095 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were randomized to first -line treatment with \nT-DM1 with or without pertuzumab or trastuzumab plus a taxane. The \nprimary endpoints were safety and PFS assessed by independent review. \nThe PFS for T -DM1 with pertuzumab was found to be non-inferior to \ntrastuzumab and a taxane (15.2 and 13.7 months , respectively; HR , 0.87; \n97.5% CI , 0.69–1.08; P = .14).\n551 The PFS for T -DM1 alone was \nnon-inferior to trastuzumab plus a taxane (14.1 and 13.7 , respectively; HR , \n0.91; 97.5% CI , 0.73– 1.13; P = .31).551 The incidence of g rade 3–5 \nadverse events was 54.1%, 45.4%, and 46.2% in the trastuzumab plus a taxane arm, T -DM1 arm, and T -DM1 plus pertuzumab arm, respectively. \nHRQOL  was maintained for a longer duration with a median of 7.7 months \nfor T-DM1 (HR , 0.70; 95% CI , 0.57–0.86) and a median of 9 months for PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-67 \nT-DM1 plus pertuzumab (HR , 0.68; 95% CI , 0.55– 0.84) compared with a \nmedian of 3.9 months for trastuzumab and a taxane.551  \nBased on the MARIANNE trial data demonstrating T- DM1 and T -DM1 with \npertuzumab being non- inferior , with better QOL compared with \ntrastuzumab plus a taxane and possibly better  tolerated for some patients,  \n551 the NCCN Panel included T-DM1  as an option for treatment of patients \nwith HER2 -positive metastatic breast cancer. Pertuzumab, trastuzumab , \nand a taxane, however, remains the preferred first-line regimen for \nHER2 -positive metastatic disease based on data demonstrating improved \nOS compared to trastuzumab and a taxane. TDM -1 as first -line therapy \nshould be considered only in those not suitable for the preferred treatment.  \nFirst-line trastuzumab in combination with selected chemotherapy552 are \nadditional  options for patients with HER2 -positive metastatic breast \ncancer. R andomized trial s demonstrate benefit  from adding trastuzumab \nto other agents including paclitaxel with or without carboplatin,552- 555 \ndocetaxel,553 and vinorelbine,553 for patients with HER2 -positive metastatic \ndisease. In addition, the combination of trastuzumab and capecitabine has \nalso shown efficacy as a first -line trastuzumab -containing regimen in this \nsetting.556,557 The NCCN Panel believes the 27% frequency of significant \ncardiac dysfunction in patients treated with the combination of \ntrastuzumab and doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in the \nmetastatic setting is too high for use of this combination outside the \nconfines of a  prospective clinical trial.552,557,558 \nIn those with disease progression on first -line trastuzumab -containing \nregimens, the NCCN Panel recommends  continuation of HER2 blockade. \nThis recommendation also applies to patients who are diagnosed with \nHER2 -positive metastatic disease after prior exposure to trastuzumab in \nthe adjuvant setting. Several trials have demonstrated benefit of \ncontinuation of tr astuzumab therapy following disease progression on a trastuzumab- containing regimen.559-561 However, the optimal duration of \ntrastuzumab in patients with long- term control of disease is unknown.  \nPertuzumab is active in patients beyond the first -line setting. The results of \na multicenter, open -label, single- arm, phase II study (n  = 66) show that the \ncombination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab is active and well tolerated in \npatients with HER2 -positive metastatic breast cancer that has progressed \non prior trastuzumab therapy.562 The trial reported an ORR of 24.2% (16 \npatients out of 66) . The median PFS time observed with pertuzumab and \ntrastuzumab combination was 1 5.5 months (range, 0.9– 17.0 months; 80% \nCI, 18 –31 months ).562 The reported  median duration of response with the \ncombination was 5.8 months (range, 2.9– 15.3 months) .562   \nTo determine whether the clinical benefit seen in the study was from \npertuzumab alone or was a result of the combined effect of pertuzumab \nand trastuzumab , a cohort of patients (n = 29) whose disease progressed \nduring prior trastuzumab -based therapy received pertuzumab \nmonotherapy  until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Of these, \npatients with disease progression (n = 17) continued to receive pertuzumab with the addition of trastuzumab.  In the 29 patients who \nreceived pertuzumab monotherapy , the ORR and clinical benefit rate \nreported were 3.4% and 10.3% , respectively, whereas in the patients who \nreceived dual blockade after disease progression while on pertuzumab, \nthe ORR and clinical benefit rate were 17.6% and 41.2%, respectively.\n563 \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, for patients with disease progression after \ntreatment with trastuzumab- based therapy without pertuzumab, a line of \ntherapy containing both trastuzumab plus pertuzumab with or without a cytotoxic agent (such as vinorelbine or taxane) may be \nconsidered.

A  \nrandomized, international, multicenter, open -label, phase III study \n(EMILIA) evaluated the safety and efficacy of T -DM1 compared with \nlapatinib plus capecitabine for HER2 -positive patients  with locally \nadvanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer  previously treated \nwith trastuzumab and a taxane.564 The primary endpoints of this study \nwere PFS, OS , and safety. T -DM1 demonstrated a statistically significant \nimprovement in both primary endpoints of PFS and OS . PFS (assessed by \nindependent review) w as significantly improved with T -DM1 with median \nPFS of 9.6 months  vs. 6.4 months with lapatinib plus capecitabine; HR for \nprogression or death from any cause was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.55 –0.77; P < \n.001). At the first interim analysis , T-DM1 also demonstrated significant \nimprovement in OS.  The stratified HR for deat h from any cause with \nT-DM1 versus lapatinib plus capecitabine was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.48– 0.81; P \n= .0005) .564 Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were higher with \nlapatinib plus capecitabine than with T -DM1 (57% vs. 41%). The \nincidences of thrombocytopenia and increased serum aminotransferase \nlevels were higher with T -DM1  (frequency >25%) , whereas the incidences \nof diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia were \nhigher with lapatinib plus capecitabine .564 \nA phase II single- arm study evaluated fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan- nxki, a \nHER2 antibody conjugated with a topoisomerase I inhibitor, in adults (n = \n184) with pathologically documented HER2- positive metastatic breast \ncancer who had received multiple previous treatments including treatment \nwith T -DM1.565 After a median duration of follow -up of 11.1 months (range \n0.7–19.9), the median response duration with fam -trastuzumab \nderuxtecan -nxki was 14.8 months (95% CI, 13.8– 16.9), and the median \nPFS was 16.4 months (95% CI, 12.7– not reached).565 Most commonly \nreported adverse events (grade 3 or higher) were a decreased neutrophil \ncount (20.7%), anemia (8.7%), nausea (7.6%) , and fatigue (6%) .565 \nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) was reported in 13.6% of the patients (grade 1 or 2,  10.9%; grade 3 or 4,  0.5%; and grade 5 , 2.2%). Based on this \nstudy  and the approval from the FDA , the NCCN P anel has included this \nas an option for HER2- positive metastatic disease noting that it is \nindicated in patients after  two or more lines of prior HER2 -targeted therapy  \nin the metastatic setting and contraindicated for those with a history of or \nactive ILD .  \nLapatinib in combination with capecitabine or trastuzumab are options for patients with HER2 -positive disease following disease progression on a \ntrastuzumab- containing regimen.  \nA phase III study compared lapatinib plus capecitabine with capecitabine \nalone in patients  with advanced or metastatic breast cancer refractory to \ntrastuzumab in the metastatic setting and with prior treatment with an \nanthracycline and a taxane in either the metastatic or adjuvant setting.\n566 \nTime to progression was increased in the group receiving combination therapy when compared with the group receiving capecitabine \nmonotherapy (8.4 mont hs vs. 4.4 months; HR, 0.49 ; 95% CI, 0.34– 0.71; P \n< .001) . The patients who had disease progress ion on monotherapy were \nallowed to cross over to the combination arm. This resulted in insufficient \npower to detect significant differences in OS; an exploratory analys is \ndemonstrated a trend toward a survival advantage with lapatinib plus \ncapecitabine.\n567 The analysis reported a median OS of  75.0 weeks for the \ncombination arm and 64.7 weeks for the monotherapy arm (HR, 0.87; 95% \nCI, 0.71 –1.08; P = .210).567 \nResults from a phase III trial in which patients with heavily pretreated \nmetastatic breast cancer and disease progression on trastuzumab therapy \nrandomly assigned to trastuzumab plus lapatinib or lapatinib monotherapy \nshowed that PFS was increased from 8.1  weeks to 12 weeks ( P = .008) \nwith the combination.568 The OS analysis data showed that lapatinib plus \ntrastuzumab improved median survival by 4.5 months, with median OS of \n14 months for the combination therapy and 9.5 months for lapatinib alone PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

The patients \nwere separated based on prior lapatinib treatment. The combination \ntherapy  resulted in a  CNS  ORR of 49%  (95% CI, 32% –66%), among  \nlapatinib- naïve patients, and 33% (95% CI, 10% –65%) among  those with \nprior lapatinib treatment.570 Median PFS and OS among lapatinib- naïve \npatients was 5.5 and 13.3 months, and 3.1 and 15.1 months among those \nwith prior lapatinib treatment. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 29% of \npatients.570  \nA prospective randomized phase III trial (NALA) randomized patients (n = \n621) with HER2 -positive breast cancer to neratinib in combination with \ncapecitabine or lapatinib plus capecitabine until disease progression.571 All \nenrolled patients received a least two lines of prior HER2 -targeted \ntreatment in the metastatic setting. Approximately 30% had received ≥3 \nprior treatment lines. About a third of all patients had received prior \ntreatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab , and T- DM1.  \nThe ORR  (32.8% vs. 26.7%; P = .1201), clinical benefit rate (44.5% vs . \n35.6%; P = .0328), and median duration of response (8.5 vs . 5.6 months) \nall favored the neratinib arm. Fewer patients required intervention for CNS \nmetastases with neratinib. The risk of progression was reduced by 24% in \nthe neratinib group (HR, 0.76; 95% CI , 0.63–0.93;  P = .0059). There was a \nnon-significant trend towards improved survival. The OS rates at 6 and 12 months were 90.2% v ersus 87.5% with neratinib + capecitabine compared \nwith 72.5% v ersus 66.7% for lapatinib in combination with capecitabine \n(HR, 0.88; 95% CI , 0.72– 1.07; P = .2086).  Diarrhea  was the most \nfrequent ly reported  side effect in the NALA trial in both arms, but a  higher \nrate was observed in patients in the neratinib group (any grade diarrhea , \n83% vs. 66%; grade 3/4 diarrhea, 24% vs. 13%).  \nBased on the results of the NALA trial and the recent FDA approval, \nNCCN has included neratinib plus capecitabine as a category 2A option in \nthis setting.  \nSystemic Therapy for Recurrent or Stage IV HR -Positive, HER2- Positive \nBreast Cancer  \nPatients  with stage IV or recurrent disease characterized by tumors that \nare HR-positive, HER2 -positive tumors have the option of receiving \nHER2 -directed therapy as a component of their treatment plan. Options \ninclude treatment with a HER2 -targeted therapy plus chemotherapy or \nendocrine therapy alone or in combination with HER2- targeted therapy. \nEndocrine therapy  alone or in combination with HER2 -targeted therapy is \na less toxic approach compared with HER2- targeted t herapy  combined \nwith chemotherapy.  Premen opausal patients treated with HER2- targeted \ntherapy and endocrine therapy should receive ovarian suppression or \nablation.  \nAdding trastuzumab or lapatinib to an AI has demonstrated a PFS advantage compared with AI alone in postmenopausal patients  with stage \nIV or recurrent HR -positive, HER2 -positive tumors .  \nIn the TAnDEM study, postmenopausal patients  (n = 207) with metastatic \nHR-positive and HER2- positive tumors were randomized to receive \nanastrozole alone or anastrozole plus trastuzumab.\n572 Compared with \nsingle -agent anastrozole, an improvement in PFS was seen with \ncombination therapy (4.8 vs. 2.4 months; HR , 0.63; 95% CI , 0.47– 0.84; P PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

The combination was associated with a higher incidence of \ntoxicities (all grades) , fatigue (21% vs. 9%), diarrhea (20% vs. 8%), \nvomiting (21% vs. 4%), and pyrexia (18% vs. 7%); serious (grade 3/4) toxicities were rare in both treatment arms.  \nThe phase III eLEcTRA trial studied the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab plus letrozole in patients (n = 93) with HER2 -positive and HR -positive \nmetastatic breast cancer. Median time to progression was 3.3 months with letrozole and 14.1 months with trastuzumab plus letrozole. The results are \nconsistent with the TAnDEM trial; however, due to smaller numbers of \npatients enrolled in this trial, this was not statistically significant (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.35– 1.29; P = .23).\n573 \nIn a phase III study of postmenopausal patients (n = 219) with HER2 -\npositive and HR -positive disease, first-line treatment with lapatinib plus \nletrozole reduced the risk of disease progression compared to treatment \nwith letrozole alone (median PFS, 8.2 months v s. 3.0 months; HR, 0.71; \n95% CI, 0.53– 0.96; P = .019).574 The combination of letrozole plus \ntrastuzumab was associated with a higher rate of grade 3 or grade 4 \ntoxicities, including diarrhea (10% vs. 1%) and rash (1% vs. 0%).574  \nIn the randomized phase II study (PERTAIN), postmenopausal patients  (n \n= 258) were randomly assigned to either first-line pertuzumab plus \ntrastuzumab and an AI  (anastrozole or letrozole) or trastuzumab plus an \nAI. There was an improvement in PFS with the three- drug combination \n(18.9 vs . 15.8 months; HR , 0.65; 95% CI , 0.48–0.89).575 Grade 3 or higher \nadverse events observed were higher trastuzumab and pertuzumab \nversus pertuzumab alone (50% vs. 39%). Of note, about half of patients \nreceived induction therapy with a taxane for 18 to 24 weeks prior to the \ninitiation of endocrine therapy. Based on the results of the PERTAIN \ntrial,575 the NCCN P anel notes that if treatment was initiated with \nchemotherapy and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, and the chemotherapy was stopped, endocrine therapy may be added to the trastuzumab plus  \npertuzumab.  \nIn the ALTERNATIVE trial, postmenopausal patients (n = 355) with \nHER2 -positive, HR- positive metastatic breast cancer were randomized to \nreceive lapatinib plus trastuzumab plus an AI, lapatinib plus an AI, or trastuzumab plus an AI without chemotherapy.\n576 All patients in the trial \nreceived prior trastuzumab and prior endocrine therapy, either in the adjuvant or metastatic disease setting. An AI in combination with lapatinib \nplus trastuzumab demonstrated a significant increase in PFS compared \nwith trastuzumab without lapatinib (11 vs. 5.7 months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI , \n0.45– 0.88,\n P = .0064 ).576 The most common adverse events with the \ncombination compared with trastuzumab or lapatinib monotherapy were diarrhea (69%, 9%, 51%), rash (36%, 2%, 28%), nausea (22%, 9%, 22%), \nand paronychia (30%, 0 %, 15%).  \nThe NCCN Panel has also included other combinations of available \nendocrine therapies such as fulvestrant or tamoxifen with trastuzumab as options for HR -positive and HER2- positive metastatic disease. These \noptions would be mostly considered after completion of chemotherapy plus HER2 -therapy or in a few patients with indolent or asymptomatic \ndisease based on  the need for continuing HER2- targeted therapy for \ndisease control.

The PFS improvements noted with olaparib were noted in all \nsubtypes and were greatest in the triple- negative population.  Subsequent \nfollow- up did not show a statistically significant difference in OS between \ntreatment arms and the study was also not powered to evaluate OS. The \nmedian OS with olaparib compared with treatment of physician’s choice \nwas 19.3 months versus 17.1 months , respectively  (HR, 0.90; 95% CI , \n0.66– 1.23; P = .513).580 The QOL was significantly better in the olaparib \narm. It is interesting to note that patients who had not received prior \nchemotherapy in the metastatic setting achieved a 7.9 -month longer \nmedian OS with olaparib compared with treatment of physician’s choice .580  \nThe phase III EMBRACA trial of patients with advanced breast cancer \nharboring the germline BRCA  mutations  and no prior exposure to  a PARP \ninhibitor, were randomized to talazoparib (n = 287) or  to physician’ s choice \nof single -agent chemotherapy  (n = 144).581 The median PFS among \npatients in the talazoparib group was longer than  in the control group (8.6 \nmonths [95% CI, 7.2–9.3] vs. 5.6 months [95% CI, 4.2 –6.7]; HR for \ndisease progression or death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 –0.71; P < .001).581   \nBased on the results of the above phase III trials, the two FDA -appr oved \nPARP inhibitors , olaparib and talazoparib, are included as category 1, \npreferred options for those with germline BRCA1/2  mutations. The NCCN \nPanel recommends assessing germline BRCA1/2  mutations in all patients \nwith recurrent or metastatic breast cancer to identify candidates for PARP inhibitor therapy.\n While olaparib and talazoparib are FDA -indicated in HER2 -negative disease, the NCCN P anel supports use in any breast \ncancer subtype as sociated with germline BRCA1/2  mutations.  \nPlatinums:  The phase III TNT trial compared docetaxel with carboplatin in \nthe first -line setting in patients  (n = 376) with triple -negative breast cancer. \nIn the unselected population, carboplatin was not more active than docetaxel (ORR, 31.4% vs. 34.0%;  P = .66). \n582 Patients with a  germline \nBRCA1/2  mutation had a significantly better response to carboplatin than \ndocetaxel (ORR, 68.0% vs. 33.3%, absolute difference, 34.7% ; P = .03). \n582 PFS was also improved with carboplatin treatment in patients with \na germline BRCA1/2  mutation (median PFS, 6.8 months vs. 4.4 months) ; \nno difference was found in OS . However, patients with somatic BRCA1/2  \nmutation in the tumor DNA did not appear to have the same advantage.  \nFor those with triple- negative recurrent/stage IV breast cancer and \ngermline BRCA1/2  mutations, the NCCN P anel has included platinum \nagents (cisplatin and carboplatin) as preferred treatment options . It is \nunknown how PARP inhibitors compare with platinums in this setting.   \nSystemic Chemotherapy for Recurrent or Stage IV D isease  \nPatients  with HR- negative tumors  not localized to the bone or soft tissue \nonly, or that are associated with symptomatic visceral metastasis  \nirrespective of HR - or HER -status, or that have HR -positive tumors that \nare refractory to endocrine therapy  should receive systemic \nchemotherapy .  \nA variety of chemotherapy regimens are felt to be appropriate, as outlined in the treatment algorithm . Combination chemotherapy generally provides \nhigher rates of objective response and longer time to progression, in comparison to single- agent chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy is, \nhowever, associated with an increase in toxicity and is of little surviv al \nbenefit.\n583-587 Furthermore, administering single agents sequentially \ndecreases the likelihood that dose reductions will be needed.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-72 \nNCCN Panel finds no compelling evidence that combination \nchemotherapy is superior to sequential single agents. Therefore, \nsequential monotherapy is preferred and combination therapy  is useful in \npatients with rapid clinical progression or need for rapid symptom and/or disease control.  \nUsually the first- line regimens are given until progression or unacceptable \ntoxicity. Considering what is unacceptable toxicity and considering no \nfurther cytotoxic therapy should be decided together with the patient.   \nAdverse effects may require dose reduction and cessation of \nchemotherapy prior to disease progression.  \nThe NCCN P anel recommends considering scalp cooling to reduce \nincidence of chemotherapy -induced alopecia for patients receiving \nchemotherapy.  The data on efficacy of scalp cooling is mainly from the \nadjuvant setting and also show that results may be less effective with anthracycline- containing regimens.\n588-592  \nA meta -analysis showed favorable impact on OS by prolonging treatment \nuntil disease progression.593 In this analysis, data from four studies \ninvolving 666 patients indicated that median OS was increased by 23% \n(95% CI , 9–38%; P = .01) in patients receiving longer durations of \nchemotherapy versus a limited number of cycles.593 In a systematic \nreview, longer durations of chemotherapy demonstrated a marginal \nincrease in OS (HR, 0.91 ; 95% CI , 0.84– 0.99) and a significant \nimprovement in PFS (HR , 0.66; 95% CI , 0.6–0.72), compared with shorter \ndurations.587  \nA more recent study of patients (n = 420 ) with HER2 -negative, advanced \nbreast cancer  showed that intermittent first -line treatment with paclitaxel \nplus bevacizumab was not inferior to continuous treatment . The m edian \noverall PFS for intermittent versus continuous treatment was 7.4  months \nand 9.7 months , respectively (HR , 1.17; 95% CI , 0.88– 1.57). Median OS was 17.5 months versus 20.9 months for intermittent versus continuous treatment (HR, 1.38; 95% CI , 1.00–1.91).\n594  \nDetermining the duration of chemotherapy in an individual patient typically \ndepends on the efficacy and tolerability and shared decision- making  \nbetween the treating physician and patient.  \nMost patients will be candidates for multiple lines of systemic therapy for \npalliation. At each reassessment clinicians should assess the value of \nongoing treatment , the risks and benefits of an additional line of systemic \ntherapy, patient performance status, and patient preferences through a \nshared decision- making process.   \nPreferred Chemotherapy  Regimens  for Stage IV or Recurrent Metastatic \nDisease  \nThe NCCN P anel has classified the chemotherapy agents into three \ncategories : preferred, other recommended , and useful in certain \ncircumstances. The treatment decision should be individualized and \nconsider previous therapies,  pre-existing  comorbidities, nature of the \ndisease, toxicity profiles, patient preferences , and in some cases access \nto agents.   \nAmong preferred single agents, the NCCN P anel has included taxanes \n(paclitaxel), anthracyclines (doxorubicin and liposomal doxorubicin), \nantimetabolites (capecitabine and gemcitabine), microtubule inhibitors \n(eribulin  and vinorelbine), and platinum agents for patients with triple-\nnegative tumors and germline BRCA1/2  mutations.   \nPaclitaxel can be administered weekly (80 mg/m2)595 or every 3 weeks \n(175 mg/m2).596 A meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials that \ncompared weekly and every -3-week  taxane regimens in advanced breast \ncancer showed that compared with every -3-week treatment, weekly PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

The median time to progression and OS were similar \nin both groups.604  \nEribulin is a non- taxane microtubule inhibitor used for  the treatment of \npatients with metastatic breast cancer who have previously received at \nleast two chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of metastatic \ndisease. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane \nin either the adjuvant or  metastatic setting. In a phase III trial, patients  (n = 762) with metastatic breast cancer were  randomized 2:1 to eribulin or \ntreatment of physician ’s choice . OS was improved in patients  assigned to \neribulin (median 13 .1 months ; 95% CI , 11.8–14.3) compare d with those \nreceiving other treatments  (10.6 months, 9.3– 12.5), a 19% statistically \nsignificant risk reduction (HR, 0. 81; 95% CI , 0.66– 0.99; P = .041).605  \nA phase III trial compared eribulin with capecitabine in patients with \nmetastatic breast cancer and showed that both treatments were similar \nwith respect to OS and PFS.606 The median PFS times for eribulin and \ncapecitabine were 4.1 and 4.2 months, respectively (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.93– 1.25; P = .30) , and the OS with eribulin versus capecitabine was \n15.9 months versus 14.5 months (HR, 0.88; 95% CI , 0.77–1.00). \n606  \nIn addition to the above, gemcitabine607 and vinorelbine are both active as \na single agents even in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic breast \ncancer .608-610 \nAmong o ther recommended single agents , the NCCN P anel has included \ntaxanes (docetaxel,611 albumin- bound paclitaxel612- 614), anthracyclines \n(epirubicin 615), and ixabepilone616- 618 as other recommended regimens.  \nIxabepilone as monotherapy has been evaluated in several phase II trials \nof patients  with metastatic breast cancer: in a first -line setting in patients \npreviously treated with anthracycline chemotherapy  616; in patients with \ntaxane- resistant metastatic breast cancer617; and in patients with \nadvanced breast cancer resistant to an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.\n618 In the phase II trials, ORR, median duration of response, \nand median OS duration were  41.5% (95% CI, 29.4% –54.4%), 8.2 months \n(95% CI, 5.7– 10.2 months), and 22.0 months (95% CI, 15.6– 27.0 months) \nin the first -line setting ;616 12% (95% CI, 4.7% – 26.5%), 10.4 months, and \n7.9 months for the taxane- resistant patients ;617 and 11.5% (95% CI, 6.3% –\n18.9%), 5.7 months, and 8.6  months for the patients previously treated \nwith an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.618 In the study by Perez PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

A randomized phase II study compared the \naddition of iniparib to gemcitabine/carboplatin versus \ngemcitabine/carboplatin in patients with triple- negative breast cancer who \nhad received no more than two prior  chemotherapies . ORR was similar in \nboth groups , 30.2% (95% CI, 24.6– 35.8) with gemcitabine/carboplatin,624 and the median OS was 11.1 months with gemcitabine/carboplatin (HR, \n0.88; 95% CI, 0.69– 1.12).624 \nSeveral phase II studies have evaluated the efficacy of pac\nlitaxel/carboplatin as first -line treatment for patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer and found the combination to be an effective therapeutic \noption in this setting .628,629 The randomized trial, tnAcity, evaluated the \nefficacy and safety of first-line  albumin- bound paclitaxel plus \ncarboplatin,  albumin- bound paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, and gemcitabine \nplus carboplatin in patients with metastatic triple- negative breast cancer.627 \nThe results of this trial reported that median PFS was significantly longer \nwith albumin- bound paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus albumin- bound \npaclitaxel /gemcitabine (8.3 vs. 5.5 months; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38–\n0.92;  P = .02) or gemcitabine/carboplatin (8.3 vs. 6.0 months; HR, 0.58; \n95% CI, 0.37– 0.90;  P = .02). The median OS was also longer \nwith albumin- bound paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus albumin- bound \npaclitaxel /gemcitabine (16.8 vs. 12.1 months; HR, 0.73 ; 95% CI, 0.47–\n1.13;  P = .16) or gemcitabine/carboplatin (16.8 vs. 12.6 months; HR, 0.80; \n95% CI, 0.52– 1.22;  P = .29). The ORR was 73%, 39%, and 44%, \nrespectively.627  \nThe NCCN P anel notes that albumin -bound paclitaxel may be substituted \nfor paclitaxel or docetaxel due to medical necessity (ie, hypersensitivity \nreaction). If substituted for weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel, then the weekly \ndose of nab- paclitaxel should not exceed 125 mg/m2. \nThe only triplet regimen listed as an option in the metastatic setting is \nCMF. This regimen was compared in the first -line setting with capecitabine \nmonotherapy, and results show similar ORR and PFS.623 However, CMF \nresulted in a shorter OS (median, 22 vs . 18 months; HR , 0.72; 95% CI , \n0.55– 0.94) compared to capecitabine.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-75 \nAdditional Targeted Therapies for Stage IV D isease U seful in C ertain \nCircumstances \nNTRK  gene fusions are seen in a few rare types of  cancer , such as \nsecretory carcinoma of the breast  or salivary gland and infantile \nfibrosarcoma and also infrequently in some common cancers, such as \nmelanoma, glioma , and carcinomas of the thyroid, lung, and \ncolon.634 NTRK  fusions are identified by fluorescence in situ  hybridization \n(FISH), next-generation sequencing (NGS) , or polymerase chain reaction \n(PCR). Larotrectinib635-637 and entrectinib637,638 are two NTRK  inhibitors \nthat are FDA -approved for the treatment of solid tumors that have an \nNTRK  gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation and \nhave no satisfactory alternative treatments or that have progressed \nfollowing treatment . If a patient with recurrent/stage IV breast cancer \npresents with a tumor with an NTRK  fusion, treatment with an NTRK  \ninhibitor is a n option if no satisfactory alternative treatments exist or for  \ndisease progress ion following treatment . \nPembrolizumab is FDA -a pproved for the treatment of patients with \nunresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) or \nmismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative \ntreatment options .639- 641 Pembrolizumab has demonstrated anti- tumor \nactivity in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer and \nhigh tumor mutational burden ( ≥9 mutations/megabase) determined by \ncommercially available tests.642 If a patient with recurrent/stage IV breast \ncancer presents with  a tumor with MSI -H/mismatch repair ( MMR ) \nmutation, whose disease has progressed following prior treatments and no \nsatisfactory alternative treatment options, treatment pembrolizumab is an \noption .  Monitoring Metastatic Disease  \nMonitoring the treatment of metastatic breast cancer involves a wide array of assessments and the need for the clinician to integrate several different \nforms of information to decide on the effectiveness of treatment and the \nacceptability of toxicity. The information includes those from direct \nobservations of the patient, including patient -reported symptoms, \nperformance status, change in weight, and physical examination; laboratory tests such as alkaline phosphatase, liver function, blood counts, \nand calcium; radiographic imaging; functional imaging; and, where \nappropriate, tumor biomarkers. The results of these evaluations  generally \nare classified as response, continued response to treatment, stable \ndisease, uncertainty regarding disease status , or progression of disease. \nThe clinician typically must assess and balance multiple different  forms of \ninformation to decide , along with the patient,  whether disease is being \ncontrolled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable. Sometimes individual pieces of information can be conflicting with regard to disease response, \nand clinical judgment along with patient input is critical.  \nThe NCCN P anel recommends using widely accepted criteria for reporting \nresponse, stability, and progression of disease such as the RECIST criteria\n643 and the WHO criteria.644 The P anel also recommends using the \nsame method of response assessment over time. For example, an \nabnormality initially found on diagnostic CT scan of the chest should be \nmonitored with repeat diagnostic CT scans  of the chest . \nThe optimal frequency of testing is uncertain and primarily based on the monitoring strategies utilized in breast cancer clinical trials. The page titled \nPrinciples of Monitoring Metastatic Disease\n in the algorithm provides a \ntable outlining general recommendations for the frequency and type of \nmonitoring as a baseline before initiation of a new therapy, for monitoring \nthe effectiveness of cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, and as an assessment when there is evidence of disease progression.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-77 \nSpecial Situations  \nPaget Disease  \nPaget disease of the breast is a rare manifestation of breast cancer \ncharacterized by neoplastic cells in the epidermis of the NAC.646 It most \ncommonly presents with eczema of the areola, bleeding, ulceration, and \nitching of the nipple. The diagnosis is often delayed because of the rare \nnature of the condition and confusion with other dermatologic conditions. \nThere is an associated cancer elsewhere in the breast in up to about 80% \nto 90 % of cases .647-649 The associated cancers are not necessarily located \nadjacent to the NAC and may be either DCIS  or invasive cancer.  \nPatients  with clinical signs that raise suspicion for Paget disease require a \ncomplete history and physical examination and diagnostic breast imaging.  \nAny breast lesion identified by imaging or examination should be \nevaluated according to the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening \nand Diagnosis . The skin of the NAC should undergo surgical biopsy , \nincluding the full thickness of the epidermis including at least a portion of \nany clinically involved  NAC.  When biopsy of the NAC is positive for Paget \ndisease, b reast MRI is recommended to define the extent of disease and \nidentify additional disease.649,650 \nThere are no category 1 data that specifically address local management \nof Paget disease. Systemic therapy is based on the stage and biological \ncharacteristics of any underlying cancer, and is supported by the evidence \ncited in the relevant stage- specific breast cancer treatment guidelines.  \nManagement of Paget disease has traditionally been total mastectomy \nwith axillary dissection. Total mastectomy remains a reasonable option for \npatients regardless of the absence or presence of an associated breast cancer.\n648 Data demonstrate that satisfactory local cont rol may be \nachieved with BCS  including the excision with negative margins of any \nunderlying breast cancer along with resection of the NAC followed by WBRT .651- 655 The risk of ipsilateral  breast recurrence after \nbreast -conserving NAC resection and RT  with or without an associated \ncancer  is similar to that with BCS and RT with the typical invasive or in situ  \ncancer.  \nFor Paget disease w ithout an associated cancer (ie,  no palpable mass or \nimaging abnormality) , it is recommended that BCS  consist of removal of \nthe entire NAC with a negative margin of underlying breast tissue. In \ncases with an associated cancer elsewhere in the breast, the surgery \nincludes removal of the NAC with a negative margin and removal of the \nperipheral cance r using standard breast -conserving technique to achieve \na negative margin. It is not necessary to remove the NAC and the \nperipheral cancer in continuity in a single surgical specimen or through a single incision. Mastectomy also remains an appropriate treatment option.   \nALN staging is not necessary when breast -conserving therapy is used to \ntreat Paget disease with underlying DCIS without evidence of invasive \ncancer following clinical examination, imaging evaluation, and \nfull-thickness skin biopsy of the involved NAC. In the presence of an \nunderlying invasive br east cancer treated with BCS , axillary surgery \nshould be performed according to the Considerations for Surgical Axillary \nStaging outlined in the NCCN G uidelines algorithm . In cases treated by \ntotal mastectomy, axilla ry staging is recommended for patients with \ninvasive disease and should also be considered for patients with \nunderlying DCIS without evidence of invasive disease. This is because the final pathology may reveal an invasive cancer in the mastectomy \nspecimen and the mastectomy precludes subsequent sentinel node \nbiopsy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-79 \nPhyllodes Tumors of the Breast  \n(also known as phyllodes tumors, cystosarcoma phyllodes)  \nPhyllodes tumors of the breast are rare tumors comprised of both stromal \nand epithelial elements.658 Phyllodes tumors exist in benign, borderline, \nand malignant subtypes, although there is not uniform agreement on the \ncriteria for assigning subtype or for predicting biological behavior.659 The \nsubtype of phyllodes tumor appears less important for risk of recurrence \nthan does the margin of tumor -free resection achieved by surgical \ntreatment. Diagnosis of phyllodes tumors prior to excisional \nbiopsy/lumpectomy is uncommon. Phyllodes tumors occur in an older age \ndistribution than fibroadenoma, a younger age distribution than the \ninvasive ductal and lobular cancers , and with a mean age of 40  years .660 \nPhyllodes tumors often enlarge rapidly and are usually painless. Phyllodes \ntumors often appear on ultrasound and mammography as fibroadenomas, \nand FNA cytology and even core needle biopsy are inadequate to reliably \ndistinguish phyllodes tumors from fibroadenoma s.660 Thus , in the setting of \na large or rapidly enlarging clinical fibroadenoma, excisional biopsy should \nbe considered to pathologically exclude a phyllodes tumor. Patients with \nLi-Fraumeni syndrome (germline TP53 mutation, see NCCN Guidelines for \nGenetic/Familial High Risk Assessment : Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic ) \nhave an increased risk for phyllodes tumors.661 Local recurrences of \nphyllodes tumors are the m ost common site of recurrence. Most distant \nrecurrences occur in the lung, and may be solid nodules or thin- walled \ncavities.  \n \nTreatment of phyllodes tumors (which includes benign, borderline, and \nmalignant subtypes) is with local surgical excision with tumor -free margins \nof ≥1 cm. Lumpectomy or partial mastectomy is t he preferred surgical \ntherapy. Total mastectomy is necessary only if negative margins cannot \nbe obtained by lumpectomy or partial mastectomy .662 Since phyllodes \ntumors rarely metastasize to the ALNs , surgical axillary staging or ALN D is \nnot necessary unless the lymph nodes are pathologic on clinical examination.663 In those patients who experience a local recurrence, \nresection of the recurrence with wide,  tumor -free surgical margins should \nbe performed. Some P anel members recommend local RT  of the \nremaining breast or chest wall following resection of a local recurrence, \nbut this recommendation is controversial (category 2B).664   \n \nWhile the epithelial component of most phyllodes tumors contains ER \n(58%) and/or PR (75 %),665 endocrine therapy has no proven role in the \ntreatment of phyllodes tumors. Similarly, there is no evidence that adjuvant \ncytotoxic chemotherapy provides benefit in reduction of recurrences or \ndeath. In the rare patient who experiences a systemic recurrence (usually \nin the lung), treatment should be as recommended in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.  \n  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-80 \nBreast Cancer During Pregnancy   \nBreast cancer occurring concurrent ly with pregnancy is  an infrequent \nclinical event. In a California registry study, there were 1.3 breast cancers \ndiagnosed per 10,000 live births.666 Unfortunately, breast cancer during \npregnancy is  most often ALN -positive and with lar ger primary tumor size.  \nHistologically the tumors are poorly differentiated,  are more  frequently \nER/PR -negative, and approximately 30% are HER2- positive.667,668 The \ndiagnosis is often delayed because neither the patient nor the physician \nsuspects malignancy.   \nEvaluation of the pregnant patient with suspected breast cancer should \ninclude a physical examination with particular attention to the br east and \nregional lymph nodes. Mammogram of the breast with shielding can be done safely and the accuracy is reported  to be >80%.\n669 Ultrasound of the \nbreast and regional lymph nodes can be used to assess the extent of \ndisease and also to guide biopsy.  Ultrasound has been reported to be \nabnormal in up to 100% of breast cancers occurring during pregnancy.669 \nBiopsies for cytologic evaluation of a suspicious breast mass may be done \nwith FNA of the brea st and suspicious lymph nodes. However, the \npreferred technique is core needle biopsy. This provides tissue for \nhistologic confirmation of invasive disease as well as adequate tissue for \nHR and HER2 analyses.  \nStaging assessment of the pregnant patient with breast cancer may be \nguided by clinical disease stage. The staging studies should be tailored to \nminimize fetal exposure to radiation. For c linically node -negative T1– T2 \ntumors, a chest x -ray (with shielding), liver function and renal function \nassessment , and a CBC with differential are  appropriate. In patients who \nhave clinically node- positive or T3 breast lesions, in addition to the \naforementioned tests an ultrasound of the liver and consideration of a \nscree ning MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine wit hout contrast may be \nemployed. The documentation of the presence of metastases may alter the treatment plan and influence the patient’s decision regarding \nmaintenance of the pregnancy.  Assessment of the pregnancy should \ninclude a maternal fetal medicine consultation and review of antecedent \nmaternal risks such as hypertension, diabetes , and complications with \nprior pregnancies. Documentation of fetal growth and development and \nfetal age by means of ultrasonographic assessment is appropriate.  \nEstimation of the date of the delivery will help with systemic chemotherapy planning. In addition, maternal fetal medicine consultation should include \ncounseling regarding maintaining or terminating pregnancy. Counseling of \nthe pregnant patient with breas t cancer should include a review of the \ntreatment options , which include mastectomy or BCS  as well as the use of \nsystemic t herapy. The most common surgical procedure has been \nmodified radical mastectomy. However, BCS is possible if RT  can be \ndelayed to the postpartum period,\n670 and breast -conserving therapy during \npregnancy does not appear to have a negative impact on survival.670,671 \nWhen surgery is performed at 25 weeks of gestation or later, obstetrical \nand prenatal specialists must be onsite and immediately available in the \nevent of precipitous delivery of a viable fetus.  \nAlthough there are a  limited number of isolated case reports and small \nretrospective studies evaluating use of SLN B in pregnant patients,672,673 \nthe sensitivity and specificity of the procedure have not been established \nin this setting. Thus, there are insufficient data on which to base recommendations for its use in pregnant patients. Decisions related to use \nof SLN B in pregnancy should be individualized. A review of the relative \nand absolute contraindications to sentinel node biopsy concluded that \nsentinel node biopsy should not be offered to pregnant patients <30 weeks \ngestation.\n674 There are limited data with only case reports and estimations \nof fetal radiation dose  regarding use of radioactive tracer (eg, technetium \n99m sulfur colloid).675- 677 Isosulfan blue or methylene blue dye for sentinel \nnode biopsy procedures is discouraged during pregnancy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-81 \nThe indications for systemic chemotherapy are the same in the pregnant \npatient as in the non -pregnant patient with breast cancer, although \nchemotherapy should not be administered at any point during the  first \ntrimester of pregnancy. The largest  experience in pregnancy has been \nwith anthracycline and alkylating agent chemotherapy .678,679 Collected data \nof chemotherapy exposure in utero indicate that the first trimester has the \ngreatest risk of fetal malformation.680,681 Fetal malformation risks in the \nsecond and third trimester are approximately 1.3%, not different than that of fetuses not exposed to chemotherapy during pregnancy. If systemic \ntherapy is initiated, fetal monitoring prior to each chem otherapy cycle is \nappropriate. Chemotherapy during pregnancy should not be given after \nweek 35 of pregnancy or within 3 weeks of planned delivery in order to avoid the potential for hematologic complications during delivery. Data \nfrom a single -institution prospective study indi cate that FAC chemotherapy \n(5-fluorouraci  500 mg/m\n2 IV days 1 and 4, doxorubicin 50 mg/ m2 by IV \ninfusion over  72 hours, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg /m2 IV day 1) may \nbe given with relative safety during the second and third trimesters of \npregnancy.679 As reported by Gwyn et al, the median gestational age at \ndelivery was 38 weeks, more than 50% of the patients had a vaginal \ndelivery , and there were  no fetal deaths.667 An update of this experience \nreported on 57 patients treated with FAC in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant \nsetting. There were 57 live births. A survey of parents/guardians reported \non the health of 40 children. There was one child with Down syndrome \nand two wi th congenital abnormalities (club foot, congenital bilateral \nureteral reflux). The children are reported to be healthy and progressing \nwell in school.679,682 Ondansetron, lorazepam, and dexamethasone can be \nused as part of the pre- chemotherapy antiemetic regimen.  \nThere are limited data on the use of taxanes during pregnancy.683-686 If \nused, the NCCN Panel recommends weekly administration of paclitaxel \nafter the first trimester if clinically indicated by disease status . There are \nonly case reports of trastuzumab use during pregnancy .687-694 The majority of these case reports indicated oligo hydramnios or an hydramnios with \nadministration of trastuzumab; fetal renal failure occurred in one case. If \ntrastuzumab is otherwise indicated, it should be adminis tered in the \npostpartum period; the Panel recommends against its use during \npregnancy.  \nA single case report of first -trimester exposure to lapatinib during \ntreatment for breast cancer reported an uncomplicated delivery of a \nhealthy female neonate.695  \nEndocrine therapy and RT are contraindicated during pregnancy. \nEndocrine therapy and RT, if indicated, should thus not be initiated until \nthe postpartum period.  \nCommunication between the oncologist and maternal fetal medicine \nspecialist is essential at every visit and for every treatment decision point \nfor the patient .  \n  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-82 \nInflammatory Breast Cancer  \nIBC is a rare, aggressive form of breast cancer estimated to account for \n1% to 6% of breast cancer cases in the United States.696,697 IBC is a \nclinical diagnosis that requires erythema and dermal edema (peau \nd’orange) of a third or more of the skin of the breast.  \nIBC is usually HR- negative and is more frequently HER2- positive than the \nusual ductal breast cancers. Studies on gene expression profiling of IBC \nhave demonstrated that all the subtypes of IBC exist, but basal and HER2 \noverexpressed are more frequent.698-701 According to the 7th edition of the \nAJCC Cancer Staging Manual , IBC is classified as stage IIIB, stage IIIC, \nor stage IV breast cancer, depending on the degree of nodal involvement \nand whether distant metastases are present. The primary tumor of IBC is \nclassified as T4d by definition, even when no mass is specifically  apparent \nin the breast. On radiographic  imaging, findings of skin thickening and, in \nsome cases, an underlying mass are observed. Despite use of the term \n“inflammatory,” the characteristic cl inical features of IBC are due to \nblockage of dermal lymphatics by tumor emboli. Although a biopsy is required to evaluate for the presence of cancer in breast tissue and the \ndermal lymphatics, a diagnosis of IBC is based on clinical findings, and \ndermal l ymphatic involvement is neither required, nor sufficient by itself, to \nassign a diagnosis of IBC.\n702,703 The differential diagnosis includes cellulitis \nof the breast and mastitis.  \nIn the past, IBC has often been placed under the general heading of \nlocally advanced breast cancer. There is a growing body of evidence that \npatients with IBC, when compared with patients with noninflammatory \nforms of locally advanced breast cancer, are more likely to have a less \nfavorable prognosis704-706 and to be younger at the time of disease \npresentation.707  The NCCN Panel acknowledges that studies focusing on genetic \ncharacterization of IBC are needed to more clearly define IBC as a \ndisease entity and to optimize treatment.708,709 Nevertheless, current \nevidence provides justification for a separate guideline for the workup and \ntreatment of patients diagnosed with IBC.  \nStageT4d, N0 –N3, M0  \nWorkup  \nPatients with a clinical/pathologic diagnosis of IBC without distant \nmetastasis (stage T4d, N0– N3, M0) should undergo a thorough staging \nevaluation by a multidisciplinary team.  \nRecommendations for workup include a complete history and physical \nexamination involving a CBC and platelet count.  \nA pathology review and pre- chemotherapy determinations of tumor \nHR- and HER2-  status should be performed. HER2 has a predictive role in \ndetermining which patients with IBC will benefit from HER2- targeted \ntherapy.  The NCCN P anel endorses the CAP protocol for pathology \nreporting (www.cap.org ) and endorses the ASCO CAP recommendations \nfor quality control performance of HER2 testing and interpretation of IHC \nand ISH results .710  \nImaging studies help facilitate image -guided biopsy, delineate locoregional \ndisease, and identify distant metastases. Evaluation of all patients \nsuspected with IBC must include diagnostic bilateral mammogram, with \nthe addition of ultrasound as necessary . A breast MRI scan is optional.   \nEvaluations for the presence of distant metastasis in the asymptomatic \npatient include LFTs , bone scan or sodium fluoride PET/CT (category 2B), \nand diagnostic CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (category \n2B; category 2A for diagnostic CT imaging of the chest when pulmonary \nsymptoms are present).

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-83 \nFDG -PET/CT may be most helpful in situations  where standard imaging \nresults are equivocal or suspicious. However, there is limited evidence \nsuggesting that PET/CT may be a useful adjunct to standard imaging of \nIBC due to the increased risk of regional lymph node involvement and \ndistant spread of dis ease in this group of patients.110,111,711,712 \nNevertheless, equivocal or suspicious sites identified by FDG -PET/CT \nscanning or other imaging methods should be biopsied for confirmation of \nstage IV disease  whenever possible. FDG -PET/CT is a category 2B \nrecommendation. The consensus of the P anel is that FDG -PET/CT can be \nperformed at the same time as diagnostic CT. If FDG -PET and diagnostic \nCT are performed and both cl early indicate bone metastases, bone scan \nor sodium fluoride PET/CT may not be needed . \nGenetic counseling is recommended if the patient is considered to be at \nhigh risk for hereditary breast cancer as defined by the NCCN Guidelines \nfor Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast , Ovarian and \nPancreatic .  \nTreatment  \nThe treatment of patients with IBC should involve a combined modality \napproach696 comprising preoperative systemic therapy  followed by surgery \n(mastectomy)  and  radiotherapy.  \nPreoperative Chemotherapy \nThere are no large randomized trials evaluating the optimal systemic treatment of IBC, since it is a rare disease. The systemic therapy \nrecommendations are based on data from retrospective analyses, small \nprospective studies, and data from non -IBC, locally  advanced breast \ncancer.  \nThe benefit of preoperative systemic therapy followed by mastectomy over \npreoperative systemic therapy alone in patients with IBC was shown in a \nretrospective analysis in which lower local recurrence rates and longer disease- specific survival were reported for the combined modality \napproach.\n713 Results from a large retrospective study of patients with IBC \nperformed over a 20 -year period at The University of Texas MD Anderson \nCancer Center demonstrated that initial treatment with doxorubicin- based \nchemotherapy followed by local therapy (ie, RT  or mastectomy, or both) \nand additional postoperative chemotherapy resulted in a 15 -year DFS rate \nof 28%.714   \nA retrospective study demonstrated that  the addition of a taxane to an \nanthracycline- based regimen improved PFS and OS in patients with \nER-negative IBC.715 A systematic review found evidence for an \nassociation between the intensity of preoperative therapy and the likelihood of a pCR.\n716 A study of IBC patients, with cytologically confirmed \nALN metastases, treated with anthracycline- based chemotherapy with or \nwithout a taxane indicated that more patients receiving the \nanthracycline- taxane combination achieved a pCR  compared with those \nwho received only anthracycline- based therapy. In addition, patients who \nhad a pCR in the ALNs  had superior OS and DFS compared with those \nwith residual axillary disease.717  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends preoperative systemic therapy with an \nanthracycline- based regimen with or without taxanes for the initial \ntreatment of patients with IBC. The P anel also recommends completing \nthe planned chemotherapy prior to mastectomy. If the chemotherapy was \nnot completed preoperatively, it should be completed postoperatively.  \nTargeted Therapy  \nAll patients with HR- positive IBC are recommended to receive endocrine  \ntherapy sequentially after completing the planned preoperative systemic therapy.  \nHER2 -positive IBC is associated with a poor prognosis.\n700,718 For patients  \nwith HER2 -positive disease, the addition of trastuzumab to primary PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-84 \nsystemic chemotherapy is associated with better response rates .414,719 -722 \nA prospective study that randomized patients  with locally advanced breast \ncancers, including those with IBC, to neoadjuvant anthracycline- based \nchemotherapy with or without trastuzumab for 1 year demonstrated that \nthe addition of trastuzumab significantly improved  the response  rate and \nevent -free survival.414 The NCCN Panel recommends inclusion of \ntrastuzumab in the chemotherapy regimen and is recommended for \npatients with HER2 -positive disease . There are no available data to \nindicate the optimal duration of trastuzumab, specifically among patients \nwith IBC. However, based on the available data,414 the Panel recommends \ncontinuing trastuzumab therapy for up to 1 year.  \nResults of small phase II trials indicate that other HER2- targeting agents \nsuch as lapatinib and pertuzumab have a clinical benefit  in IBC.723,724 The \nresults of the NEOSPHERE trial that included patients with IBC showed \nincreased pCR with the pertuzumab- containing regimens. Therefore , the \nNCCN Panel has included in a footnote that a pertuzumab- containing \nregimen may be administered preoperatively in patients with \nHER2 -positive IBC.724   \nDetermination of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in IBC should \ninclud e a combination of physical examination and radiologic assessment . \nSurgery  \nPatients with a clinical/pathologic diagnosis of IBC should always  be \ntreated with chemotherapy before surgery. It has been known for many \nyears that surgical treatment as primary  treatment of patients with IBC  is \nassociated with poor outcomes.725 SLN dissection is not a reliable method \nof assessing ALNs  among patients  with IBC.726 Use of BCS  in patients \nwith IBC has been associated with poor cosmesis, and limited data \nsuggest that rates of local recurrence may be higher when compared with \nmastectomy. B reast -conserving therapy is not recommended for patients \nwith IBC.  Mastectomy with level I/II ALN D is the recommended surgical procedure \nrecommended by the NCCN Panel for patients whose tumor responds to \nneoadjuvant  chemotherapy. The NCCN Panel has listed delayed breast \nreconstruction as an option that can be recommended to patients with \nIBC who have undergone a modified radical mastectomy. Reconstruction \nof the breasts soon after mastectomy may compromise the \npost-mastectomy RT outcomes.727  \nFor patients with IBC who do not respond to preoperative systemic \ntherapy, mastectomy is not generally recommended. Additional systemic \nchemotherapy and/or preoperative radiation should be considered for \nthese patients. Patients with tumors responding to this secondary \ntherapy should unde rgo mastectomy and subsequent treatment as \ndescribed above.    \nRadiation  \nAfter mastectomy,  RT is recommended after the completion of the \nplanned chemotherapy.  \nThe probability of locoregional lymph node involvement is high for \npatients  with IBC.  To reduce the risk of local recurrence, t he Panel \nrecommends RT to the chest wall and the supraclavicular region.  If the \ninternal mammary lymph node(s) is clinically or pathologically involved, \nRT should include the internal mammary nodes. If the internal mammary \nnodes are not clinically or pathologically involved, then including  the \ninternal mammary nodes in the RT  field is at the discretion of the treating \nradiation oncologist ( category 3). For HER2- positive disease, \ntrastuzumab may be administered concomitantly with RT . \nStage IV or Recurrent IBC  \nPatients with stage IV or recurrent IBC should be treated according to \nthe guidelines for recurrence/stage IV breast cancer .

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-85 \nAxillary Breast Cancer   \nOccult  breast cancer  presenting with axillary  metastases is an unusual \npresentation that can be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. \nEvidence to support recommendations  for patients presenting with \naxillary breast cancer comes from a limited number of retrospective \nstudies involving small numbers of patients728-730 (see also references \ntherein). Although treatment of patients with axillary metastases from an unknown primary tumor has typically involved mastectomy and axillary \nnodal dissection, some of these patients have also been successfully \ntreated with axillary n odal dissection followed by RT.\n729,730 \nPatients with a suspected occult primary  breast cancer  will typically \npresent to the oncologist after undergoing an initial biopsy : core needle \nbiopsy (preferred) , and/or FNA. Accurate pathologic assessment of the  \nbiopsied material is most important. Therefore, the pathologist must be consulted to determine whether the available biopsy material is \nadequate, or if additional biopsy material is necessary ( eg, core needle, \nincisional , or excisional biopsy)  to provide an accurate and complete \ndiagnosis . \nWorkup for Possible Primary  Breast Cancer  \nMRI of the breast  can facilitate the identification of occult breast cancer, \nand can help select those patients most likely to benefit from mastectomy.\n731 For example, in a study of 40 patients with biopsy -proven \nbreast cancer in the axilla, and a negative or indeterminate \nmammogram, MRI identified the primary breast lesion in 70% of the \npatients.729 In addition, of the 7 patients with a negative MRI who \nsubsequently underwent ALN D and RT to the whole breast, no evidence \nof local recurrence was evident at a median follow -up of 19 months.  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Occult Primary  provide guidance on the \ndiagnosis and initial workup of patients with a suspicious axillary mass without any signs of a primary tumor. A small subset of these patients may have a primary cancer in the axillary tail of the breast. \nAdenocarcinoma with positive axillary nodes and mediastinal nodes  is \nhighly suggestive of a breast primary . Adenocarcinoma in the \nsupraclavicular nodes, chest, peritoneum, retroperitoneum, liver, bone, \nor brain could also indicate primary breast cancer in patients. The \nguidelines suggest the use of a mammogram and breast ultrasound for \nsuch patients .  \nTesting for immunohistochemical markers  including ER/PR and HER2 is \nrecommended. Elevated ER/PR levels provide strong evidence for a  \nbreast cancer diagnosis .\n732 MRI of the breast should be considered for a \npatient with histopathologic evidence of breast cancer when \nmammography and ultrasound are not adequate to assess the extent of \nthe disease . MRI may be especially helpful in patients  with dense breast \ntissue, positive axillary nodes, and suspected occult primary breast \ntumor or to evaluate the chest wall .733 Breast MRI has been shown to be \nuseful in identifying the primary site in patients with occult primary breast \ncancer and may also facilitate breast conservation in selected patients by \nallowing for lumpectomy  instead of mastectom y.729,734 In one report, the \nprimary site was identified  using MRI  in about half of the patients  \npresenting with axillary metastases, irrespective of the breast density .735  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Occult Primary  also provide recommendations \nfor additional workup, including chest and abdominal CT to evaluate for \nevidence of distant metastases for patients diagnosed with \nadenocarcinoma (or carcinoma not otherwise specified) of the axillary \nnodes without evidence of a primary breast lesion. In particular, breast \nMRI and ultrasound are recommended. Axillary ultrasound should also \nbe performed.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nBreast Cancer  \n \nMS-86 \nTreatment for Possible Primary  Breast Cancer  \nPatients with MRI -positive breast disease should undergo evaluation with \nultrasound or MRI -guided biopsy and receive treatment according to the \nclinical stage of the breast cancer. Treatment recommendations for those \nwith MRI -negative disease are based on nodal status. For patients with \nT0, N1, M0 disease, options include mastectomy plus axillary nodal dissection or axillary nodal dissection plus whole breast irradiation with \nor without nodal irradiation. Systemic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, \nor trastuzumab is given according to the recommendations for stage II or \nIII disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, trastuzumab, and endocrine \ntherapy should be considered for patients with T0, N2– N3, M0 disease \nfollowed by axillary nodal dissection and mastectomy as for patients with \nlocally advanced disease.  \nSummary  \nThe therapeutic options for patients with noninvasive or invasive breast \ncancer are complex and varied. In many situations, the patient and \nphysician have the responsibility to jointly explore and select the most \nappropriate option from among the av ailable alternatives. With few \nexceptions, the evaluation, treatment, and follow -up recommendations in \nthese guidelines are based on the results of past and present clinical \ntrials. However, there is not a single clinical situation in which the \ntreatment of breas t cancer has been optimized with respect to either \nmaximizing cure or minimizing toxicity and disfigurement. Therefore, patient/physician participation in prospective clinical trials allows patients \nto not only receive state- of-the-art cancer treatment but also to contribute \nto improving the treatment outcomes.\n  \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:28:04 PM.
