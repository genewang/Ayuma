Skeletal survey is acceptable in certain circumstances.  \n• If FDG-PET/CT or whole-body low-dose CT is negative, whole-body MRI without contrast may be considered to discern smoldering myeloma \nfrom MM.\nImaging of Solitary Plasmacytoma\n• Whole-body FDG-PET/CT is the first choice for initial and continued evaluation of solitary extraosseous plasmacytoma. For solitary osseous \nplasmacytoma, whole-body MRI (or FDG-PET/CT if MRI is not available) is the first choice for initial evaluation.\n• Since the risk of progression of solitary plasmacytoma into MM or relapse is relatively high (14%–38% within the first 3 years of diagnosis), \nyearly, follow-up with the imaging technique used at first diagnosis for the first 5 years and subsequently only in case of clinical or \nlaboratory signs or symptoms.1 \nImaging for Follow-up  of Smoldering Myeloma\n• Advanced whole-body imaging (ie, FDG-PET/CT, low-dose CT, MRI without contrast) is recommended annually or as clinically indicated. If \nimaging findings are the only parameters indicating initiation of treatment and if findings are doubtful, the same imaging technique should \nbe repeated after 3 to 6 months. If only an MRI had been performed, whole-body low-dose CT should be done to exclude lytic lesions.\nImaging for Follow-up of MM\n• Advanced whole-body imaging (ie, FDG-PET/CT, low-dose CT, MRI without contrast) is recommended as needed. Residual focal lesions \ndetected by either FDG-PET/CT or MRI have been shown to be of adverse prognostic significance.2-5\n• Patients who do not have measurable levels of M protein or free light chain should be followed using imaging at regular intervals.\nReferences\n1 Paiva B, Chandia M, Vidriales MB, et al.

CTV expansions should generally include at least 0.5 cm of margin for microscopic extent, and up to 2–3 \ncm for involvement of long bones. PTV margins should be minimized using modern daily image guidance. Treatment of adjacent vertebral \nbodies for spine lesions is not required if there is no suspicion of clinical involvement.\n• RT should be utilized with advanced technology (ie, intensity-modulated RT [IMRT], VMAT, protons) when these modalities can help limit \nradiation doses to surrounding OARs. Principles of involved-site RT (ISRT) should be used to avoid large radiation fields and inappropriately \nincluding uninvolved sites, which will increase the risk of toxicity.\nTreatment Information/Dosing :\n• Solitary plasmacytoma (MYEL-2)\n\u0017RT (40–50 Gy in 1.8–2.0 Gy fractions [20–25 total fractions]) to involved site.\n\u0017Treatment with 35–40 Gy is an acceptable alternative for solitary plasmacytomas <5 cm in size, due to the high rates of local control \nreported for smaller tumors.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

RT can result in functional re-ossification in a large proportion of patients.\n• For principles of RT for CNS disease in patients with MM, see Principles of Management of CNS Disease in Patients with MM ( MYEL-H).\nTiming and Sequencing of Therapy :\n• Systemic therapy should not be delayed for RT. Data suggest that systemic therapy and palliative RT can be used concurrently without evidence of \nincreased toxicity, but that patients should be carefully monitored for toxicities.  \n• If urgent surgical intervention is indicated, RT should be delivered postoperatively to improve pain control and prevent local recurrence. Patients in a \nresource-limited setting with access to systemic therapy may consider forgoing postoperative RT. \nPalliative RT Dosing for MM :\n• Low-dose RT (8 Gy x 1 fraction) or 20–30 Gy in 5–15 total fractions can be used as palliative treatment for indications such as uncontrolled pain, for \nimpending pathologic fracture, or for impending cord compression. Moderately fractionated courses of 20–25 Gy in 8–10 fractions are generally preferred \nover higher doses (30 Gy) absent extenuating circumstances (eg, severe symptomatic cord compression) to limit toxicity risk and reduce future toxicity risk \nin the event additional irradiation is needed to adjacent or overlapping sites (eg, overlapping sites in the spine/spinal cord. \n• Limited involved sites should be used to limit the impact of irradiation on hematopoietic stem cell harvest or impact on potential future treatments.\n• For RT dose constraint suggestions regarding bone marrow and other OARs, see NCCN Guidelines for Hodgkin Lymphoma. \nReferences\nElhammali A, Amini B, Ludmir EB, et al.

MRD tests should be initiated only at the \ntime of suspected complete response. All categories of response and MRD \nrequire no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic \nstudies were performed. However, radiographic studies are not required to \nsatisfy these response requirements except for the requirement of FDG-PET if \nimaging MRD-negative status is reported. b Sustained MRD negativity when reported should also annotate the method \nused (eg, sustained flow MRD-negative, sustained sequencing MRD-\nnegative). c Bone marrow MFC should follow NGF guidelines. The reference NGF method \nis an eight-color two-tube approach, which has been extensively validated. \nThe two-tube approach improves reliability, consistency, and sensitivity \nbecause of the acquisition of a greater number of cells. The eight-color \ntechnology is widely available globally and the NGF method has already \nbeen adopted in many flow laboratories worldwide. The complete eight-color \nmethod is most efficient using a lyophilised mixture of antibodies, which \nreduces errors, time, and costs. Five million cells should be assessed. The \nFlow Cytometry Method (FCM) method employed should have a sensitivity of \ndetection of at least 1 in 10⁵ plasma cells. Paiva B, Gutierrez NC, Rosinol L, et \nal, for the GEM (Grupo Españolde MM)/PETHEMA (Programa para el Estudio \nde la Terapéutica en Hemopatías Malignas) Cooperative Study Groups. High-\nrisk cytogenetics and persistent minimal residual disease by multiparameter \nflow cytometry predict unsustained complete response after autologous stem \ncell transplantation in multiple myeloma. Blood 2012;119:687-691.d DNA sequencing assay on bone marrow aspirate should use a validated \nassay. e Criteria used by Zamagni and colleagues, and expert panel (IMPetUs; Italian \nMyeloma Criteria for PET Use). Baseline positive lesions were identified by \npresence of focal areas of increased uptake within bones, with or without any \nunderlying lesion identified by CT and present on at least two consecutive \nslices. Alternatively, an SUVmax = 2.5 within osteolytic CT areas >1 cm in size, \nor SUVmax = 1.5 within osteolytic CT areas ≤1 cm in size were considered \npositive. Imaging should be performed once MRD negativity is determined by \nMFC or NGS. Zamagni E, Nanni C, Mancuso K, et al. PET/CT improves the \ndefinition of complete response and allows to detect otherwise unidentifiable \nskeletal progression in multiple myeloma. Clin Cancer Res 2015;21:4384-4390.f Derived from international uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma. \nReprinted with permission from The Lancet Oncology, 17: Kumar S, Paiva B, Anderson K, et al. International Myeloma Working Group consensus criteria for response \nand minimal residual disease assessment in multiple myeloma, e328-e346, Copyright (2016), with permission from Elsevier.Minor response definition and clarifications derived from Rajkumar and colleagues. When \nthe only method to measure disease is by serum FLC levels: complete response can be \ndefined as a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 to 1.65 in addition to the complete response criteria \nlisted previously. Very good partial response in such patients requires a ≥90% decrease \nin the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. All response categories \nrequire two consecutive assessments made at any time before the institution of any new \ntherapy; all categories also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions \nor extramedullary plasmacytomas if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic \nstudies are not required to satisfy these response requirements. Bone marrow \nassessments do not need to be confirmed. Each category, except for stable disease, will \nbe considered unconfirmed until the confirmatory test is performed. The date of the initial \ntest is considered as the date of response for evaluation of time dependent outcomes such \nas duration of response. Durie BG, Harousseau JL, Miguel JS, et al, for the International \nMyeloma Working Group. International uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma. \nLeukemia 2006;20:1467-1473.g All recommendations regarding clinical uses relating to serum FLC levels or FLC ratio are \nbased on results obtained with the validated serum FLC assay. h Presence/absence of clonal cells on immunohistochemistry is based upon the κ/λ/L ratio. \nAn abnormal κ/λ ratio by immunohistochemistry requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells \nfor analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is κ/λ of >4:1 or \n<1:2. i Special attention should be given to the emergence of a different monoclonal protein \nfollowing treatment, especially in the setting of patients having achieved a conventional \ncomplete response, often related to oligoclonal reconstitution of the immune system. \nThese bands typically disappear over time and in some studies have been associated with \na better outcome. Also, appearance of monoclonal IgG κ in patients receiving monoclonal \nantibodies should be differentiated from the therapeutic antibody. j Plasmacytoma measurements should be taken from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or MRI \nscans, or dedicated CT scans where applicable. For patients with only skin involvement, \nskin lesions should be measured with a ruler. Measurement of tumor size will be \ndetermined by the SPD.k Positive immunofixation alone in a patient previously classified as achieving a complete \nresponse will not be considered progression. For purposes of calculating time to \nprogression and progression-free survival, patients who have achieved a complete \nresponse and are MRD-negative should be evaluated using criteria listed for progressive \ndisease. Criteria for relapse from a complete response or relapse from MRD should be \nused only when calculating disease-free survival. l In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (eg, a \npossible laboratory error), that value will not be considered when determining the lowest \nvalue.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

Based on functional status, patients may be started with a 2- or 3-drug regimen with additional drugs added \nas performance status improves.\n• Consider dose modifications based on functional status and age.\n• Consider discontinuing dexamethasone at earliest possible timepoint, based on response, frailty, and toxicity considerations.\n• For additional supportive care while on myeloma therapy, see Supportive Care Treatment for Multiple Myeloma (MYEL-I) .\nConsiderations for Special Populations:\n• Older Adults\n\u0017Frailty assessment should be considered in older adults. See NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology .\n\u0017For the Myeloma Frailty Score Calculator developed by IMWG for the prognosis, see http://www.myelomafrailtyscorecalculator.net/1\n• Black/African American Individuals\n\u0017Black/African American individuals have the highest rate of myeloma of any race/ethnic group and twice the incidence of all other races \nand ethnicities, earlier age at diagnosis, and present with more severe symptoms at diagnosis including increased anemia, higher calcium \nlevels, worse renal dysfunction, and more extramedullary disease at presentation. \n\u0017The biology of myeloma in these individuals can also differ. Black/African American individuals are more likely to have chromosome 14 \ntranslocations such as t(11;14), t(14;16), and t(14;20), and are less likely to have high-risk mutations such as del17p and gain/amp 1q \ncompared to white individuals. \n\u0017Decreased participation in clinical trials exists based on race, ethnicity and age, which leads to limited understanding of whether results of \nthe studies apply to all patients.\n\u0017A study of outcomes of patients with MM showed that without disparities in the overall use of novel agents or autologous HCT, Black/\nAfrican American individuals and age <65 years had a superior median overall survival (OS) (7.07 years; 95% CI, 6.36–7.70 years) compared \nwith white patients (5.83 years; 95% CI, 5.44–6.09 years; P < .001) (Fillmore NR, et al. Blood 2019;133:2615-2618). \n\u0017Toxicity of drugs can vary in Black/African American individuals, including hyperpigmentation of skin with use of IMiDs and higher risk for \ncytokine release syndromes (CRS) during CAR T-cell therapy (Blevins F, et al. Blood 2020;136:23-24; Peres LC, et al. Blood Adv 2024;8:251-\n259). \n\u0017Due to these differences, in order to reflect populations most affected, it is recommended to conduct equitable and inclusive clinical trials.\n1 Palumbo A, Bringhen S, Mateos MV, et al.

Patients with disease refractory to the novel drug \nin the doublet backbone should be considered for triplet therapy that \ndoes not contain the drug they are progressing on.  \n• Immunoglobulin replacement should be considered for patients \nwith an IgG <400 mg/dLa or at a higher level for supportive care as \nclinically indicated. (See MYEL-J)\n• Patients may be candidates for TCR Therapy. (See MYEL-G).\nFor HCT and Stem Cell Storage :\n• Exposure to myelotoxic agents (including alkylating agents and \nnitrosoureas) should be limited to avoid compromising stem cell \nreserve prior to stem cell harvest in patients who may be candidates \nfor HCT. \n• Consider harvesting autologous peripheral blood stem cells within \nthe first 6 cycles of therapy initiation prior to prolonged exposure to \nlenalidomide and/or daratumumab in patients for whom HCT is being \nconsidered.\n• If delayed HCT is considered, then autologous stem cells should be \ncollected and stored. Dosing and Administration:\n• An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any \nrecommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines. \n• Subcutaneous bortezomib is the preferred method of administration.\n• Both weekly (preferred) and twice-weekly dosing schemas of \nbortezomib may be appropriate.\n• Carfilzomib may be used weekly (preferred) or twice-weekly and at \ndifferent doses. \n• For any regimen that includes daratumumab, this could be \ndaratumumab for intravenous infusion or daratumumab and \nhyaluronidase-fihj for subcutaneous injection. Daratumumab and \nhyaluronidase-fihj for subcutaneous injection has different dosing \nand administration instructions compared to daratumumab for \nintravenous infusion.\n• Steroids should be reduced to 20 mg weekly in patients who are \nolder and should be decreased or discontinued with treatment \nresponse plateau and/or toxicity. \nSide Effects and Lab Interference :\n• Daratumumab and isatuximab-irfc may interfere with serologic \ntesting and cause false-positive indirect Coombs test.\n• Type and screen should be performed before using daratumumab or \nisatuximab-irfc.\n• Monoclonal antibodies can produce a false positive serum \nimmunofixation if the monoclonal protein is IgG kappa and special \ninterference testing or mass spectrometry based assessment can \ndifferentiate between the two.\n• Carfilzomib can potentially cause cardiac, renal, and pulmonary \ntoxicity, especially in patients who are older .\n• Agents such as bendamustine can impact the ability to collect T \ncells for CAR T-cell therapy. See NCCN Guidelines for Management \nof Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities.\na In assessing the need for gammaglobulin replacement in patients with IgG myeloma, it is important to take into the account the portion of IgG that is clonal. To estimate \nthe normal IgG levels, subtract the M spike value from the IgG.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-2 Overview \nMultiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant neoplasm of plasma cells that \naccumulate in bone marrow, leading to bone destruction and marrow \nfailure. MM is most frequently diagnosed among people aged 65 to 74 \nyears, with the median age being 69 years.1 The American Cancer Society \nhas estimated 35,730 new MM cases  and an estimated 12,590 deaths  in \nthe United States in 2023.2 \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the development and update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at  www.NCCN.org .  \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the annual update of the NCCN Guidelines for Multiple Myeloma, \nan electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key \nliterature published since the previous update, using the following search \nterms: Smoldering Multiple Myeloma, Solitary Plasmacytoma, Multiple \nMyeloma, Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance, and POEMS syndrome. The PubMed database was chosen because it \nremains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature. \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Guideline; Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as \nrelevant to these guidelines as discussed by the panel have been included \nin this vers ion of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which \nhigh- level evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of lower -\nlevel evidence and expert opinion. Sensitive/Inclusive Language  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist , and anti -weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN \nGuidelines incorporate non- gendered language, focusing on organ-\nspecific recommendations. This language is accurate and inclusive and \ncan help fully address the needs of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, \nor data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. \nMost studies do not report how sex and gender data are collected and use \nthese terms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the \ninformation is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. \nNCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in \ntheir future analyses.    \nDiagnosis and Workup \nIt is important to distinguish MM from other plasma cell \nneoplasms/dyscrasias to determine prognosis and provide appropriate \ntreatment.  \nThe initial diagnostic workup in all patients should include a history and \nphysical examination. To differentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic MM \nthe following baseline laboratory studies are needed: a complete blood \ncount (CBC) with differential; examination of peripheral blood smear; blood \nurea nitrogen (BUN); serum creatinine; creatinine clearance (calculated or \nmeasured directly) and serum electrolytes; liver function tests ; serum PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-3 calcium; serum uric acid; albumin; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); and \nbeta- 2 microglobulin.  \nPeripheral smear may show abnormal distribution of red blood cells  \n(RBCs)  such as the Rouleaux formation (red cells taking on the \nappearance of a stack of coins) due to elevated serum proteins.3 \nIncreased BUN and creatinine indicate decreased kidney function, \nwhereas LDH and beta -2 microglobulin levels reflect tumor cell \ncharacteristics. NT -proBNP is also recommended, and if N- terminal \nprohormone of brain natriuretic peptide N- terminal prohormone of brain \nnatriuretic peptide (NT -proBNP ) is not available BNP can be performed.  \nSerum and Urine Analysis : Serum analysis includes quantitative \nimmunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, and IgM); serum protein electrophoresis \n(SPEP) for quantitation of  M protein; and serum immunofixation \nelectrophoresis (SIFE) to obtain more specific information about the type of M protein present. Assessing changes in levels of various proteins, \nparticularly the M  protein, helps track disease progression and response to \ntreatment. Urine analysis as a part of the initial diagnostic workup includes \nevaluating 24- hour urine for total protein, urine protein electrophoresis \n(UPEP), and urine immunofixation electrophoresis (UIFE).  \nFree Light  Chain Assay : The serum free light chain ( FLC) assay along with \nserum M protein analyses (SPEP and SIFE) yield high sensitivity while \nscreening for MM and related plasma cell disorders.\n4-6 It is also helpful in \nprognostication of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance \n(MGUS), smoldering myeloma, active MM, immunoglobulin light chain \namyloidosis, and solitary plasmacytoma.6,7 The serum FLC assay also \nallows for quantitative monitoring of patients with light chain amyloidosis and light chain myeloma. In addition to all of the above, the FLC ratio \n(FLCr) is required for documenting stringent complete response (sCR) \naccording to t he International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform \nResponse Criteria.\n8 The serum FLC assay cannot replace the 24- hour UPEP for monitoring patients with measurable urinary M  protein and can \nalso be affected by renal function Once individuals are found to have an M \nprotein, light chain abnormalities, or both, the same studies should be \nused serially. Patients with a negative UPEP do not need this study \nrepeated, except to confirm remission or if the clinical situation changes.  \nBone Marrow Evaluation : The percentage of clonal bone marrow plasma \ncells ( BMPCs; ≥10%) is a major criterion for the diagnosis of MM. The \npercentage of plasma cells in bone marrow is estimated by unilateral bone \nmarrow aspiration and biopsy. Immunohistochemistry and/or flow \ncytometry can be used to confirm presence of monoclonal plasma cells, \nand to more accurately quantify plasma cell involvement.9 The cytoplasm \nof abnormal plasma cells contains either kappa or lambda light chains, \nand predominance of one or the other light chain expressing plasma cells \nindicates clonality. Specific immunophenotypic profiles of the myeloma \ncells may have prognostic implications.10 \nCytogenetic Studies:  A lthough MM may be morphologically similar, \nseveral subtypes of the disease have been identified at the genetic and molecular level s. Bone marrow studies at initial diagnosis should include \nchromosome analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed on the plasma cells obtained from bone marrow aspiration. \nMetaphase cytogenetics is not recommended unless myelodysplasia is \nsuspected . Specific chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in \npatients with MM involving translocations, deletions, or amplifications.  \nAccording to the NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel members, the FISH panel \nfor prognostic estimation of plasma cells should be examined for del (13), \ndel(17p13) , t(4;14), t(11;14), t(14;16), t(14:20), 1q21 gain/amplification, \nand 1p deletion. The utility of this information is to determine biological \nsubtype and for prognostic recommendations as well as candidacy for \nclinical trials.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-4 Deletion of 17p13 (the locus for the tumor -suppressor gene, p53 ) leads to \nloss of heterozygosity of TP53 and is considered a high- risk feature in \nMM.11-13  \nSeveral studies have confirmed that MM patients with t(4;14), t(14;16), \nand t(14;20) have a poor prognosis, while t(11;14) is believed to impart \nless risk.14-17  \nAbnormalities of chromosome 1 are also among the frequent \nchromosomal alterations in MM.18 The short arm is most often associated \nwith deletions and the long arm with amplifications.19 Gains/amplification \nof 1q21 increases the risk of MM progression and incidence of the \namplification is higher in relapsed than in newly diagnosed patients.18,20 \nRisk stratification based on the chromosomal markers is being utilized for \nprognostic counseling, selection, and sequencing of therapy.21-23 \nImaging: A skeletal survey has been the standard for decades for \nassessing bone disease for any individual with suspected MM.24 However, \nthis technique has significant limitations related to lower sensitivity compared to advanced imaging.  CT alone or in combination with FDG -\nPET has been shown to be significantly superior regarding the sensitivity \nto detect osteolytic lesions in patients with monoclonal plasma cell \ndisorders. A multicenter analysis by the IMWG compared conventional \nskeletal survey with whole- body CT scans from 212 patients with \nmonoclonal plasma cell disorders. Whole- body CT was positive in 25.5% \nof patients with negative skeletal survey. The sensitivity of the skeletal survey and whole- body low -dose CT in the long bones is not significantly \ndifferent ; the difference is mainly in detection of abnormalities in the spine \nand pelvis.\n24 In a study of 29 patients, 5 (17%) showed osteolytic lesions \nin CT while skeletal survey results were negative.25 Furthermore, studies \nhave shown whole- body low -dose CT is superior to skeletal survey radiographs in areas that are difficult to visualize with skeletal surveys \nsuch as the skull and ribs.26  \nFDG -PET/CT too has been shown to identify more lesions than plain x -\nrays and detect lesions in patients with negative skeletal surveys.27-29 It is \nimportant to note that if FDG -PET/CT is chosen instead of whole- body \nlow-dose CT, the imaging quality of the CT part of the FDG -PET/CT \nshould be equivalent to a whole- body low -dose CT. Usually the CT part is \nused only for attenuation correction, which may not be sufficient to assess \nbone disease due to MM and stability of the spine. Whole- body PET/CT is \nuseful in detecting extramedullary disease outside of the spine.  \nFor initial diagnostic workup of patients suspected of having MM, the \nNCCN Panel recommends either whole- body low -dose CT or FDG - \nPET/CT. The p anel has also noted that skeletal survey including long \nbones is acceptable where advanced imaging is not available (eg , in low-\nresource settings). CT contrast agents are not necessary for detection of myeloma bone disease and should generally  be avoided in myeloma \npatients whenever possible.  \nAdditional Diagnostic Tests  \nThe NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel recommends additional tests that may \nbe useful in some circumstances. MRI and PET are useful for discerning \nsmoldering myeloma from MM.  Since the disease burden in patients with smoldering myeloma is lower than those with MM, imaging techniques \nwith high sensitivity need to be used and MRI is a sensitive technique for \ndetecting marrow infiltration by myeloma.\n30,31 PET is used specifically to \nrule out lytic bone disease as well as extramedullary involvement. \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, if whole- body low -dose CT or FDG -PET/ \nCT is negative, consider whole- body MRI without contrast to discern \nsmoldering myeloma from MM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-5 A tissue biopsy may also be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of \nsuspected  plasmacytomas , particularly extramedullary deposits . Also, if \namyloidosis is suspected, the diagnosis is established by following the recommendations outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for Systemic Light \nChain Amyloidosis . \nSerum viscosity should be evaluated when clinical symptoms of \nhyperviscosity are suspected, particularly in those with high levels of M \nprotein.   \nHepatitis B and C testing and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) \nscreening should be done as required.  \nSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and/or next -generation \nsequencing (NGS) panel on bone marrow help provide a more detailed \nevaluation of MM genetics and allow for further risk categorization through \nthe identification of additional abnormalities that may be of prognostic \nand/or therapeutic value.32 Therefore, the NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel \nhas included these tests as a useful adjunct in certain circumstances.  \nThe panel  also suggests baseline clone identification or storage of bone \nmarrow aspirate sample for clone identification for future minimal residual \ndisease (MRD) testing by NGS if required and assessment for circulating \nplasma cells in peripheral blood, as clinically indicated.  Risk assessment \nby gene expression profiling can also be considered.33  \nClinical Findings  \nBased on the results of the clinical and laboratory evaluation, patients are initially classified as either MGUS, solitary plasmacytoma, smoldering \n(asymptomatic) disease , or active (symptomatic) disease. More recently, \npatients with an MGUS who have organ dysfunction related to the \nmonoclonal gammopathy have been variably classified as having \nmonoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS) or monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) , depending on the nature of \norgan involvement.  \nStaging and Risk S tratification Systems for MM \nDefinitions: The IMWG definition of MM includes biomarkers in addition to \nrequirements of CRAB features.\n34 The CRAB criteria that define MM \ninclude: increased c alcium levels ( >11.5 mg/dL), renal insufficiency \n(creatinine >2 mg/dL or creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min), anemia \n(hemoglobin <10 g/dL or 2 g/dL less than normal), and presence of b one \nlesions.  The IMWG has also clarified that presence of one or more \nosteolytic lesions seen on skeletal radiography, whole- body MRI, or \nwhole -body FDG -PET/CT fulfills the criteria for bone disease.34 The MM -\ndefining biomarkers identified by the IMWG SLiM features (SLiM stands \nfor Sixty, Light chain ratio,  MRI) include one or more of the following: \ngreater than or equal to s ixty percent clonal plasma cells in the bone \nmarrow; involved/uninvolved free light chain ratio of 100 or more with the \ninvolved FLC being greater than or equal 100 mg/L; or MRI with more than \none focal marrow (non- osteolytic) lesion .34 All of these myeloma- defining \nevents are referred to as SLiM -CRAB. Asymptomatic patients fulfilling \nthese criteria should be treated as having active MM.  \nThe criteria by the IMWG for patients with smoldering (asymptomatic) MM \ninclude serum M  protein (IgG or IgA) greater than or equal to 30 g/L and/or \nclonal BMPCs  10% to 59% and absence of CRAB features, myeloma -\ndefining events, or amyloidosis.34 The updated IMWG diagnostic criteria \nfor MM allow initiation of therapy before end -organ damage on the basis of \nspecific biomarkers, and also allow the use of sensitive imaging criteria to diagnose MM, including whole- body FDG -PET/CT and MRI.\n34 Recently, a \nstudy analyzed clinical and laboratory information from 421 patients with smoldering myeloma and identified M protein greater than 2 g/dL, FLCr of \ngreater than 20, and plasma cells greater than 20% as important risk factors for progression. Patients with 2 or more of these features had a PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-6 median time to progression (TTP) of 29 months.35 Mateos et al in an \nanalysis of 2004 patients found that the presence of t(4;14), t(14;16), 1q \namp/gain, or del(13q) was a further risk factor and patients with one of \nthese findings, along with all 3 of the 20/2/20 model had a risk of \nprogression of 67% at  2 years.36   \nRisk Stratification : The NCCN P anel has provided a list of factors that put \npatients at high risk of disease progression and/or relapse. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed MM, these factors include being diagnosed as R -\nISS III, having extramedullary disease,37 having circulating plasma cells,38 \nhave certain cytogenetic abnormalities [eg, del(1p32) , t(4;14), t(14;14), t \n(14;20), del (17p)/monosomy 17; 1q21 gain/1q21 amplification; MYC \ntranslocation]39; or high- risk gene expression profile.33  \nThe NCCN P anel has also listed factors for risk of disease progression in \nthose with relapsed MM. These include disease relapse within 2 years of initial therapy with hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and maintenance \nregimens or with 6 months of primary induction therapy with HCT; acquisition of 1q gain and/or del( 17p)\n39; or presence of extramedullary \ndisease at  relapse.37 \nThese factors are useful for counseling patients regarding prognosis and \nfor selection and sequencing of subsequent therapy.   \nStaging Systems : Those with active MM can be staged using the \nInternational Staging System (ISS).40 The ISS identifies three  stages \nbased on serum beta- 2 microglobulin and serum albumin.  \nThe revised ISS (R -ISS) includes serum beta- 2 microglobulin, serum \nalbumin, and prognostic information from the LDH and high-risk \nchromosomal abnormalities [t(4;14), t(14;16), 17p13 deletion] detected by \nFISH and is the preferred staging approach.41 Having del(17p) and/or \ntranslocation t(4;14) and/or translocation t(14;16) are considered as high \nrisk. Those with no high- risk chromosomal abnormality are considered standard risk. The R -ISS also identifies three stages: 1) R-ISS I , which \nincludes ISS I standard risk chromosomal abnormalities or evaluated LDH levels; 2) R-ISS III , which  includes ISS III and either high-risk \nchromosomal abnormalities or elevated LDH levels; and 3) R-ISS II, which  \nincludes all the other possible combinations and is neither R- ISS I nor R -\nISS II.  \nThe main limitation of the R -ISS is that most of the patients were classified \nas R-ISS II or the intermediate- risk group ; it therefore included patients \nwith large variations in risk of  progression/death.  \nIn the second revision of the R- ISS (R2 -ISS), the intermediate- risk group \nhas been further divided into low - and high- risk groups.23 \nTherefore, the R2 -ISS identifies four risk groups by assigning a numerical \nvalue to each risk factor based on their influence on overall survival (OS): \nISS-III is 1.5 points, ISS -II is 1 point, del(17p) is 1 point, t(4;14) is 1 point, \n1q+ is 0.5 points, and serum LDH > the upper limit of normal is 1 point. The l ow-risk group is 0 points, l ow-intermediate-risk group is  0.5–1 points; \nintermediate high- risk group is 1.5–2.5 points , and high- risk group  is 3–5 \npoints.\n23 The limitation of R2- ISS is that it has only been validated in newly \ndiagnosed MM.  \nSolitary Plasmacytoma  \nThe diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma or solitary plasmacytoma with \nminimal marrow involvement requires a thorough evaluation with \nadvanced imaging studies to rule out the presence of additional lesions or \nsystemic disease, because many patients presumed to have solitary \nplasmacytomas are found to have additional sites .42,43  \nWhole- body imaging with low -dose CT or FDG -PET/CT is recommended \nfor initial diagnostic workup of patients suspected of having MM or solitary \nplasmacytoma. Skeletal survey is acceptable in certain circumstances. \nHowever, skeletal survey is significantly less sensitive than whole- body PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-7 low-dose CT and FDG -PET/CT in detecting osteolytic lesions in patients \nwith monoclonal plasma cell disorders.24   \nWhole- body imaging with MRI (or FDG -PET/CT , if MRI is not available) is \nthe first choice for initial evaluation of solitary osseous plasmacytoma, and \nwhole -body FDG -PET/CT is the first choice for initial evaluation of solitary \nextraosseous plasmacytoma. The sensitivity of FDG -PET/CT for areas of \nincreased metabolism and the high soft -tissue resolution of MRI enable \nboth techniques to provide information on the presence or absence of solitary plasmacytomas. While the sensitivity of both techniques for the \ndetection of focal lesions is similar, MRI provides a higher sensitivity for a \ndiffuse infiltration.\n44,45 No data exist on the comparison of FDG -PET/CT \nand MRI in solitary plasmacytoma. In retrospective analyses, the risk of \nprogression to MM within 2 years of diagnosis has been shown to be \nhigher with osseous plasmacytoma (35%) compared with extramedullary \nlesions (7%).46 This might, at least in part, be due to undetected diffuse \ninfiltration reflecting systemic disease, which makes the superior sensitivity of MRI significant in this regard . Since the risk of progression of solitary \nplasmacytoma into MM or relapse is relatively high (14% –38% within the \nfirst 3 years of diagnosis), yearly follow -up with the same imaging \ntechnique used at first diagnosis should be performed for the first 5 year s \nand subsequently only in case of clinical or laboratory signs or symptoms.\n47 \nPrimary Therapy for Solitary Plasmacytoma  \nThe treatment and follow -up options for solitary plasmacytoma or solitary \nplasmacytoma with minimal marrow involvement ( <10% plasma cells in \nbone marrow) are similar. RT has been shown to provide excellent local control of solitary plasmacytomas.\n48-54 The largest retrospective study (N = \n258) included patients with solitary plasmacytoma (n = 206) or \nextramedullary plasmacytoma (n = 52).55 Treatments included RT alone (n \n= 214), RT plus chemotherapy (n = 34), and surgery alone (n = 8). Five-year OS was 74%, disease- free survival was 50%, and local control was \n85%.55  \nPatients  with solitary plasmacytoma  (n = 206) who received localized RT \n(varying doses) had a lower rate of local relapse (12% in those who \nreceived between 40– 50 Gy) than those who did not  receive RT and were \ntreated with surgery (80%) .54 \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, treatment planning of solitary \nplasmacytomas should be performed using modern treatment principles \nincluding imaging- based delineation (MRI, CT with contrast, and/or FDG -\nPET CT) of a gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), and \nplanning target volume (PTV) and adjacent organs at risk (OAR s). CTV \nexpansions should generally include at least 0.5 cm of margin for \nmicroscopic extent, and up to 2 to 3 cm for involvement of long bones. \nPTV margins should be minimized us ing modern daily image guidance. \nTreatment of adjacent vertebral bodies for spine lesions is not required if \nthere is no suspicion of clinical involvement. In addition, advanced \ntechnology ( ie, intensity -modulated RT [ IMRT ], volumetric modulated arc \ntherapy [ VMAT ], protons) should be used when feasible to limit radiation \ndoses to surrounding OAR s. Principles of involved -site RT (ISRT) should \nbe used to avoid large radiation fields and inappropriately including uninvolved sites that would increase the risk o f toxicity.  \nThe dose used in most published papers ranges from 30 to 60 Gy.\n53,54,56 \nThe recommended RT dose by the NCCN P anel is 40 to 50 Gy in 1.8 to \n2.0 Gy fractions (20–25 total fractions) to the involved site. The panel also \nrecommends treatment with 35 to 40 Gy as an alternative for solitary \nplasmacytomas less than 5 cm in size, due to the high rates of local \ncontrol reported for smaller tumors .51,57- 59 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

Serial measurements to check for re -\nemergence or appearance of M  protein are required to confirm disease \nsensitivity to RT. The recommended follow -up interval for patients with \nplasmacytoma after RT is every 3 to 6 months. The imaging results may \nnot be accurate if the scans are performed sooner than 3 months of RT. \nHowever, patients with soft tissue and head/neck plasmacytoma could be \nfollowed less frequently after an initial 3- month follow -up. All \nplasmacytomas should be imaged yearly, preferably with the same technique used at diagnosis, for at least 5 years. \nThe blood tests include CBC with differential and platelet count, serum \nchemistry for creatinine, and corrected calcium. Serum FLC assay, serum \nquantitative immunoglobulins , and SPEP with SIFE may be performed as \nneeded.  \nThe urine tests as needed include 24- hour urine assay for total protein, \nUPEP, and UIFE. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are recommended as clinically indicated.  \nIf progression to MM occurs, then the patient should be re -evaluated as \ndescribed in Diagnosis and Workup, and systemic therapy must be administered as clinically indicated.  \nSmoldering (Asymptomatic) Myeloma  \nSmoldering (asymptomatic) myeloma describes a stage of disease with no symptoms and no related organ or tissue impairment.\n60 Patients with asymptomatic smoldering MM may have an indolent course for many \nyears without therapy.  \nPrimary Therapy for Smoldering (Asymptomatic) Myeloma  \nSmoldering myeloma is a precursor to MM. All patients with smoldering \nmyeloma have a risk of progression to MM.61 However, the rate  of \nprogression varies from months to several years based on certain risk \nfeatures.61  \nThe historic approach for management of smoldering myeloma has been close observation. However, recently there has been mounting evidence \nthat those with high -risk features may benefit from early intervention.   \nA relatively small, randomized, prospective, phase III study by the \nPETHEMA group investigated whether early treatment with lenalidomide \nand dexamethasone in patients (n = 119) with smoldering myeloma, at \nhigh risk of progression to active MM, prolongs the TTP.62 The high-risk \ngroup in the study was defined using the f ollowing criteria: plasma cell \nbone marrow infiltration of at least 10% and/or a monoclonal component (defined as an IgG level of ≥3 g/dL, an IgA level of ≥2 g/dL, or a urinary \nBence Jones protein level of >1 g per 24 hours); and at least 95% \nphenotypically aberrant plasma cells in the bone marrow infiltrate. The OS \nreported in the trial at 3 years was higher in the group treated with the lenalidomide and dexamethasone arm (94% vs. 80%; HR, 0.31; 95% CI, \n0.10– 0.91; P = .03).\n62 At a median follow -up of 75 months (range, 27– 57 \nmonths), treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone delayed median \nTTP to symptomatic disease compared to no treatment (TTP was not \nreached in the treatment arm compared to 23 months in the observation \narm; HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.14 –0.41).63 The high OS rate seen after 3 years \nwas also maintained (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20 –0.90).

Based on the criteria used in the trial, some patients with active \nmyeloma were classified as having high- risk smoldering myeloma.  \nIn a larger , multicenter , phase III , randomized trial, patients with \nsmoldering myeloma (n  = 182) were either treated with  lenalidomide until \nprogression or observed. The lenalidomide group experienced improved \nprogression- free survival (PFS) and  decreased end organ damage (eg, \nrenal failure, bone lesions) when compared with those who were \nobser ved.64 Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 41% of \npatients treated with lenalidomide.64 On subgroup analysis, the PFS \nbenefit was  seen  in those with high- risk smoldering myeloma but was \nless clear in those with low - or intermediate- risk disease.64  \nThe Mayo 2018 20/2/20 criteria stratify  patients based on risk. The criteria \ntake into consideration the following risk factors: percentage of BMPC s \ngreater than 20%, M  protein greater than 2 g/dL, and FLCr greater than \n20. Patients with two or more of the above risk factors are considered to \nhave high risk. These risk factors were developed from a retrospective \nstudy of patients with smoldering myeloma (n  = 417). In those with high \nrisk (≥2 factors present), the estimated median TTP was 29 months, in those with intermediate risk (1 factor present), the estimated median TTP \nwas 68 months, and for those with low risk (none of the risk factors \npresent), the es timated median TTP was110 months.\n35  \nThe Mayo 2018 20/2/20 criteria were validated in a large retrospective \nanalysis of 2004 patients with smoldering myeloma.65 The estimated \nprogression rates at 2 years among those with low- , intermediate- , and \nhigh- risk disease were 5%, 17%, and 46% , respectively.65  \nThe NCCN Panel suggests using the Mayo 2018/IMWG 20/2/20 criteria to stratify patients based on risk. According to the NCCN Panel, the low-risk \ngroup should be enrolled in a clinical trial or observed at 3- to 6-month \nintervals (category 1). For the high- risk group, the NCCN Panel prefers enrollment in an ongoing clinical trial (strongly recommended and \npreferred option) or observation at 3 -month intervals, as clinically indicated \nor treatment with single- agent lenalidomide only in carefully selected \npatients (category 2B).\n62,64 Those with rising markers or high- risk factors \nmust be monitored closely.  It is important to note that patients can evolve \nfrom having low -risk to high -risk SMM over time, requiring recalibration of \nfollow- up strategies.  \nSurveillance/Follow -up Tests for Smoldering (Asymptomatic) \nMyeloma \nThe surveillance/follow- up tests for smoldering myeloma include CBC with \ndifferential and platelet count; serum chemistry for creatinine, albumin, \ncorrected calcium, serum quantitative immunoglobulins, SPEP, and SIFE; \nand serum FLC assay as clinically indicated. The urine tests include 24-\nhour urine assay for total protein, UPEP, and UIFE.  \nBone marrow aspirate and biopsy with FISH, SNP array, NGS, or \nmultiparameter flow cytometry may be used as clinically indicated.   \nImaging studies with MRI without contrast, whole- body low -dose CT \nand/or CT, and/or whole- body FDG -PET/CT are recommended annually \nor as clinically indicated. The NCCN Panel recommends considering using \nthe same imaging modality used during the initial workup for the follow -up \nassessments. \nIf the disease progresses to symptomatic myeloma, then patients should \nbe treated according to the guidelines for symptomatic MM.  \nActive (Symptomatic) Multiple Myeloma  \nNewly diagnosed MM is typically sensitive to a variety of classes of drugs: immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors (PIs), and \nmonoclonal antibodies.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-10 Primary Therapy for Active (Symptomatic) Multiple Myeloma \nPatients presenting with active (symptomatic) myeloma are initially treated \nwith primary therapy and primary therapy is followed by high- dose \nchemotherapy with autologous HCT in transplant -eligible patients.  \nOne of the first steps in evaluating newly diagnosed patients with MM is to \ndetermine whether they are candidates for high- dose therapy and \ntransplant, based on age and comorbidities. However, it should be noted that advanced age and renal dysfunction are not absolute \ncontraindications to transplant. Therefore, referral to an HCT center to \nassess whether a patient is eligible for HCT is important.  \nStem cell toxins, such as nitrosoureas or alkylating agents , compromise \nstem cell reserve. Regimens with these agents (notably melphalan) should \nbe avoided in patients who are potential candidates for HCT until stem \ncells are collected. If delaying HCT,  then stem cells should be collected \nand stored. The p anel recommends harvesting peripheral blood stem cells \nwithin the first 6 cycles of therapy initiation prior to prolonged exposure to \nlenalidomide and/or daratumumab if HCT is being considered.  \nThe algorithm has a list of primary therapy regimens recommended by the \nNCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel members for transplant -eligible and \nnon-transplant candidates and also lists drugs recommended for \nmaintenance therapy in each setting. The list is selected and is not \ninclusive of all regimens.  \nThe NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel has categorized all myeloma therapy \nregimens as: “preferred,” “other recommended,” or “useful in certain \ncircumstances.” The purpose of classifying regimens as such is to convey \nthe sense of the p anel regarding the relative efficacy and toxicity of the \nregimens. Factors considered by the p anel include evidence, efficacy, \ntoxicity, pre -existing comorbidities such as renal insufficiency, and in some \ncases access to certain agents.  The NCCN Panel prefers 3- drug regimens as the standard for primary \ntreatment of all patients who are transplant eligible. This is based on \nimproved response rates, depth of response, and rates of PFS or OS seen \nwith 3 -drug regimens in clinical trials. Frai lty assessment should be \nperformed in older adults, as well as consideration of dose modifications, particularly steroids, based on functional status and age.  \nThe doublet regimens are no longer recommended for transplant candidates with the rationale that doublets would be recommended for \npatients who would not be considered for initial treatment with a 3 -drug \nregimen,  such as those not initially eligible for transplant. Patients with \npoor performance status or who are frail can be started on a 2- drug \nregimen, with a third drug added after performance status improves.  \nIt is also important to consider supportive care for all patients at diagnosis. \nFor example, 80% of patients have bone disease and up to 33% have \nrenal compromise. In all patients, careful attention to supportive care is \ncritical to avoid early complicatio ns that may compromise therapeutic \noutcome.  \nGeneral Considerations for Dosage and A dministration of C ommonly Used \nAgents : \nWhile weekly and twice- weekly dosing schemas of bortezomib are \nacceptable and supported by data, weekly dosing is preferred.  Twice -\nweekly bortezomib can be associated with neuropathy that may limit \nefficacy due to treatment delays or discontinuation. Therefore, Reeder et \nal modified the CyBorD regimen to a once- weekly schedule of \nbortezomib.\n66 In the study, patients treated with weekly bortezomib \nachieved responses similar to the twice- weekly schedule ( overall response \nrate [ ORR] , 93% vs. 88%; very good partial response [VGPR ], 60% vs. \n61%). In addition, they experienced fewer  grade 3/4 adverse events \n(37%/3% vs. 48%/12%).

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-11 bortezomib/dexamethasone were required in the modified schedule and \nneuropathy rates were the same in both cohorts, even though the total \nbortezomib dose per cycle was higher in the weekly versus the twice -\nweekly schedule (6.0 mg/m2 vs. 5.2 mg/m2).66 \nThe NCCN Panel has noted that subcutaneous administration is the \npreferred route for bortezomib. This is based on the results of the MMY -\n3021 trial. The trial randomized patients (n = 222) to single- agent \nbortezomib administered either by the conventional IV route or by \nsubcutaneous route.67 The findings from the study demonstrate non-\ninferior efficacy with subcutaneous versus IV bortezomib with regard to the primary endpoint (ORR after 4 cycles of single- agent bortezomib). The \nresults showed no significant differences in terms of PFS or 1- year OS \nbetween groups.\n67,68 However, patients receiving bortezomib \nsubcutaneously had a significant reduction in peripheral neuropathy.   \nCarfilzomib can potentially cause cardiac, renal, and pulmonary toxicities. Careful assessment before initiating treatment with carfilzomib and close \nmonitoring during treatment is recommended. Regarding dosing and \nadministration, the panel notes that carfilzomib may be used once or twice \nweekly and at different doses. Ixazomib may be substituted for carfilzomib \nin select patients.  \nA randomized trial has compared two formulations of daratumumab as \nmonotherapy. The subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab and \nhyaluronidase -fihj resulted in  a similar ORR, PFS, and safety profile and \nfewer infusion -related reactions compared with IV daratumumab.\n69 \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, daratumumab IV infusion or \ndaratumumab and hyaluronidase- fihj, subcutaneous injection may be \nused in all daratumumab -containing regimens. Some patients may not be \nappropriate for subcutaneous treatment, for example those with \nsignificant thrombocytopenia.  Prolonged use of steroids can be detrimental in frail patients >60 years of \nage. Therefore, the NCCN P anel recommends a tailored approach of \nreducing the dose to 20 mg weekly and discontinuing  with either treatment \nresponse plateau or toxicity.70,71  \n \nBy binding to CD38 expressed on the surface of RBCs, daratumumab and isatuximab- irfc may result in false -positive indirect antiglobulin test \n(indirect Coombs test). The binding of these antibodies to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum and \ninterferes with serologic testing . Therefore, type and screen should be \nperformed before using daratumumab or isatuximab -irfc.  \nThe monoclonal antibodies used for myeloma treatment can produce a \nfalse -positive serum immunofixation, if the M protein is IgG kappa. In such \ninstances, special interference testing or mass spectrometry -based \nassessment may be used to differentiate between the two.  \nBone disease, renal dysfunction, and other complications such as \ninfections, hypercalcemia, hyperviscosity, and coagulation/thrombosis \nshould be treated with appropriate adjunctive measures (see Supportive \nCare for Multiple Myeloma in this Discussion).  \nPreferred Primary Therapy Regimens for Newly Diagnosed \nTransplant Candidates  \nThe preferred primary therapy options for patients who are HCT eligible \ninclude bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone (category 1) and \ncarfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone (category 2A).  \nBortezomib/Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone  \nPhase II and III study results have shown that  primary therapy with \nbortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone is active and well tolerated in PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

VGPR rate or better at the completion of \ninduction was 58%.73 After transplantation and consolidation therapy the \nrate of VGPR or better was 70% and 87%, respectively.73  \nBortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone was compared to lenalidomide/dexamethasone in the multicenter phase III SWOG S077 \ntrial.\n75 Patients (n = 525) with previously untreated MM were randomly \nassigned to receive 6 months of induction therapy with either bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone (N = 264) or \nlenalidomide/dexamethasone (N = 261), each followed by maintenance \ntherapy with lenalidomide/dexamethasone until progression or \nunacceptable. The triple- drug regimen group had significantly longer PFS \n(43 months vs. 30 months; HR, 0.712; 96% CI, 0.56– 0.906) and improved \nmedian OS (75 months vs. 64 months; HR, 0.709; 95% CI, 0.524–\n0.959).\n75 As expected, ≥ grade 3 neuropathy was more frequent in the \nbortezomib- containing arm (24% vs. 5%; P < .0001) as bortezomib was \nadministered twice weekly and intravenously in this study.75    With longer -term follow- up (median 84 months), the benefits of adding \nbortezomib to lenalidomide and dexamethasone were seen to be \nmaintained.76 The PFS with bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone was \n41 months versus 29 months for lenalidomide/dexamethasone.76 The OS \nwas not yet reached (>84 months) with the bortezomib regimen versus 69 \nmonths for lenalidomide/dexamethasone.76 \nA randomized multicenter phase III trial (ENDURANCE E1A11) studied \nnewly diagnosed patients (n  = 1053) with MM  treated with either \nbortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone or \ncarfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone as induction therapy. Patients \nwith high -risk features [ with the exception of patients with t(4;14) ] were \nnot included in this trial. After a median follow -up of 9 months, median \nPFS was 34.4 months with the bortezomib -regimen versus 34.6 months \nwith the carfilzomib regimen.77 A response of VGPR or better was seen \nin 65% of patients treated with bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone \nand 74% of patients treated with \ncarfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone ( P = .0015). With respect to \nadverse events, the carfilzomib regimen was associated with less \nperipheral neuropathy but more cardiac,  pulmonary , and renal \ntoxicities.77   \nIn order to minimize the toxicities seen with the standard  dose of \nbortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone, a phase II study evaluated  \nthe efficacy of dose -adjusted bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone \n(VRd -lite).78 The VRd- lite regimen included subcutaneous bortezomib \n(1.3 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, 15 , and 22, and oral dexamethasone (20 mg) \non the day of and the day after bortezomib administration. Lenalidomide \nwas omitted on days 1, 8, and 15, which are the days of bortezomib \nadministration. The ORR after 4 cycles of VRd -lite was 83%, including a \nCR of 25%.

It is administered intravenously.  \nA multicenter phase I/II trial evaluated the combination of carfilzomib, \nlenalidomide, and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed patients with MM.79 \nIn this trial, patients (n = 53) received carfilzomib with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone. After 4 cycles, hematopoietic cells were \ncollected from eligible patients.\n79 Out of 35 patients from whom \nhematopoietic cells were collected, 7 proceeded to transplantation, and \nthe remainder continued with carfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.79 \nWith a median follow -up of 13 months, 24 -month PFS was estimated at \n92%.The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities in ≥10% of patients \nincluded hypophosphatemia (25%), hyperglycemia (23%), anemia (21%), \nthrombocytopenia (17%), and neutropenia (17%).

Twenty -\nfive patients completed 8 cycles of the carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone regimen, of which 24 continued to lenalidomide therapy \nand 1 patient opted to exit the study after initial therapy.  The most \ncommon non -hematologic and hematologic toxicities (≥ grade 3) in >10% \nof patients included electrolyte disturbances (18%), liver function test \nelevation (13%), rash/pruritus (11%), fatigue (11%), lymphopenia (63%), anemia (16%), leukopenia (13%), and thrombocytopenia (11%).80  This \nstudy also accessed MRD. The PFS was found to be longer in patients \nwith negative MRD.81 \nAnother phase II study examined patients (n = 76) with newly diagnosed \nMM who received carfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone primary \ntherapy followed by HCT. The primary endpoint of sCR after 8 cycles of \ntherapy was met, with a 60% sCR rate in the overall population. In a \nmedian follow -up of 56 months, median PFS and OS were not reached. \nThe estimated 5- year PFS rate was 72% , and the estimated 5- year OS \nrate was 84% in the intention to treat population. Adverse events of grade 3 to 4 included neutropenia ( 34%), lymphopenia (32%), infection (22%), \nand cardiac events (3%).\n82 \nThe results of the phase III ENDURANCE trial77 showed similar PFS with \ncarfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone versus \nbortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone. However, as mentioned \npreviously, high- risk patients were not included. \nCarfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone was associated with less \nneuropathy but more dyspnea, hypertension, heart failure, and acute \nkidney injury compared with bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.77 \nBased on the data from the above studies, the NCCN Panel has included the carfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone regimen as a preferred \noption for primary treatment of transplant -eligible patients with MM.  \nThe NCCN Panel has included in a footnote that ixazomib may be \nsubstituted for carfilzomib in select patients receiving the \ncarfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone regimen.

In the phase II GRIFFIN trial, \ntransplant -eligible patients with MM (n  = 207) were randomized to \ndaratumumab/ bortezomib/ lenalidomide /dexamethasone  or \nbortezomib/ lenalidomide /dexamethasone  followed by autologous HCT \nplus consolidation and maintenance.85 The sCR rate after autologous \nHCT and consolidation with the 4 -drug regimen was 42% versus 32% \nwith the 3 -drug regimen.85 Follow -up after a median of 22 months \nshowed further improved sCR rates for the daratumumab- containing 4 -\ndrug regimen (62.6% vs . 45.4%;  P = .0177).85 Although the hematologic \ntoxicities were higher with the 4- drug regimen, no major safety concerns \nwere reported in the study.85 \nSubsequent analysis showed that the benefit persisted after longer \nfollow- up. After 24 months, the rate of sCR was 66% for the \ndaratumumab- containing 4 -drug regimen compared with 47% for \nbortezomib/ lenalidomide /dexamethasone  (P = .0096). In those who \nreceived the 4 -drug regimen, the MRD -negative status for ≥ 12 months \nwas seen in 44% vs.12.6% with the 3- drug combination ( P < .0001).  86  The NCCN Panel has included \ndaratumumab/lenalidomide/bortezomib/dexamethasone as an option for \nprimary treatment of transplant -eligible patients with MM.  \nRegimens Useful In Certain Circumstances for Newly Diagnosed \nTransplant Candidates  \nBortezomib/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone   \nData from three phase II studies involving newly diagnosed patients with \nMM have demonstrated high response rates with cyclophosphamide, \nbortezomib, and dexamethasone ( CyBorD) as primary treatment.74,87,88 \nThe trial by Reeder et al carried out in the United States and Canada demonstrated an ORR of 88% , including a VGPR or greater of 61% and \n39% CR/near CR with CyBorD as the primary regimen.\n87 The depth of \nresponse seen after primary treatment was maintained after transplant in \nthose who underwent transplantation (70% rates of CR/near CR; rate of at \nleast VGPR or better was 74%).87 According to the long- term follow- up \nanalysis, the 5- year PFS and OS rates were 42% (95% CI, 31– 57) and \n70% (95% CI, 59– 82).89 \nAnalysis of the German DSMM XIa study also demonstrated high \nresponses with CyBorD as primary treatment (ORR was 84%, with a \n71.5% PR rate and 12.5% CR rate). High response rates were seen in patients with unfavorable cytogenetics.\n88  \nIn the updated results of the phase II EVOLUTION study, primary \ntreatment with CyBorD demonstrated an ORR of 75% (22% CR and 41% \n≥ VGPR), and the 1 -year PFS rate was 93%.74  \nBased on data from these and other phase II studies, the NCCN Multiple \nMyeloma Panel has now included the combination of \nbortezomib/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone to the list of primary \ntreatment available for transplant candidates.

Response rates improved with bortezomib maintenance (34% vs. 49%; P \n< .001).\n90 After a median follow -up of 41 months, PFS in patients treated \nwith bortezomib/doxorubicin/dexamethasone as primary therapy followed \nby HCT and bortezomib maintenance was 35 months versus 28 months in \npatients treated with VAD followed by HCT and maintenance with thalidomide. Patients treated with bortezomib/doxorubicin/dexamethasone \nhad a significantly better PFS (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62– 0.90; P = .002).\n90 \nThe OS was also found to be better in the bortezomib, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone arm (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60– 1.00; P = .049). In high- risk \nmyeloma with increased creatinine more than 2 mg/dL, bortezomib \nsignificantly improved PFS from a median of 13 months to 30 months (HR, \n0.45; 95% CI, 0.26– 0.78; P = .004) and OS from a median of 21 months to \n54 months (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.16 –0.65; P < .001).

In \naddition, newly developed grade 3 to 4 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 8% of patients during thalidomide maintenance and 5% of patients during \nbortezomib maintenance.90 \nBased on data from the HOVON -65/GMMG -HD4 trial and the uniform \nconsensus among the NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel members, \nbortezomib/doxorubicin/dexamethasone is a regimen that may be useful in \ncertain circumstances for primary therapy for transplant -eligible patients \nwith MM.  \nCarfilzomib/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone  \nThe carfilzomib/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone regimen has been \nstudied in phase I/II trials of transplant -ineligible newly diagnosed patients \nwith MM. Trials have investigated both once- weekly and twice -weekly \ncarfilzomib dosing combined with fixed- dose cyclophosphamide and \ndexamethasone.91,92 A pooled analysis of two phase I and II studies \ncomparing two alternative schedules of carfilzomib, transplant -ineligible \nnewly diagnosed patients with MM showed similar response rates in those treated with once- weekly carfilzomib at a dose of 70 mg/m\n2 compared to \nthose treated with twice -weekly carfilzomib at a dose of 36 mg/m2. The \nPFS and OS were also similar. The median PFS was 35.7 months in the \nonce- weekly group and 35.5 months in the twice- weekly group (HR , \n1.39;  P = .26). The 3- year OS was 70% and 72%, respectively (HR , \n1.27;  P = .5).93 \nConsistent with the above results, a phase I b study, CHAMPION -2, \nevaluated the safety and tolerability of twice- weekly carfilzomib ( three  \ndifferent doses) in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed MM patients.

The rates of \nVGPR or better were also significantly higher with the addition of \nisatuximab (60.5% vs . 77.3%; P < .001) and overall adverse events and \nserious adverse events reported were similar between the arms.101 Preferred Primary Therapy Regimens for Newly Diagnosed Non -\nTransplant Candidates  \nMany of the regimens described above for transplant candidates are also \noptions for non- transplant candidates. As in transplant -eligible patients, 3-\ndrug regimens are preferred by the NCCN Panel as these regimens have been shown to induce higher response rates and depth of response in \nclinical trials. The 2 -drug regimens are reserved for older  and/or frail \npatients. The list of preferred options for non- transplant candidates \nincludes: bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone and \ndaratumumab/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.  \nBortezomib/Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone  \nPhase II study results (discussed in the transplant setting) have shown \nthat primary therapy with bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone is \nactive and well tolerated in all newly diagnosed patients with MM \nregardless of autologous HCT status.\n72  \nThe randomized phase III SWOG S0777 trial, comparing \nbortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone to lenalidomide/dexamethasone \nas induction therapy without an intent of immediate transplantation, \nreported superior results with the 3- drug regimen.75,76 \n \nIn transplant -ineligible newly diagnosed patients with MM, a phase II study \nwith the dose- adjusted VRd- lite regimen showed that the dose -adjusted \nregimen had comparable efficacy and better tolerability than the standard-\ndose regimen. The VRd-lite dosage included lenalidomide 15 mg orally on \ndays 1–21; bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 subcutaneously on days 1, 8, 15, and \n22; and dexamethasone 20 mg orally on the day of and the day after \nbortezomib for 9 cycles followed by 6 cycles of consolidation with \nlenalidomide and bortezomib.

Treatment -related deaths \noccurred in 4% of patients in the daratumumab group and 3% of patients \nin the control group. Based on the results of this study the FDA has \napproved the use of daratumumab/lenalidomide/dexamethasone in this \nsetting.103 \nThe NCCN Panel has also included \ndaratumumab/lenalidomide/dexamethasone as a category 1, preferred \noption for newly diagnosed patients who are transplant ineligible. \nOther Recommended Primary Therapy Regimens for Newly \nDiagnosed Non -Transplant Candidates  \nDaratumumab/Bortezomib/Melphalan/Prednisone  \nIn the randomized phase III trial (ALCYONE), randomized patients (n =  \n706) with newly diagnosed MM ineligible for transplant were to receive \nbortezomib/melphalan/prednisone with or without daratumumab until \ndisease progression.104 The addition of daratumumab increased the ORR (90.9% vs. 73.9%) , and PFS at 18 months was 72% versus 50%. With \nrespect to toxicity, there was an increased rate of grade 3 or 4 infections \n(23% vs. 15%) and daratumumab -related infusion reactions were seen in \n27.7% of patients.  \n \nBased on the results of the ALCYCLONE trial, the NCCN Panel has \nincluded daratumumab/bortezomib/melphalan/prednisone as a category 1 \noption for treatment of patients with newly diagnosed MM not eligible for \nHCT. S ince regimens containing melphalan are rarely used in North \nAmerica, the regimen daratumumab in combination with bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone has now been listed under \nother recommended regimens in this setting.       \nCarfilzomib/Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone  \nThe results of a phase I/II trial demonstrated that the combination of \ncarfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone is well  tolerated and is also \neffective in all newly diagnosed patients.79 An updated follow- up analysis \nof the subset of 23 older  patients (aged ≥65 years) showed that use of the \ncarfilzomib, lenalidomide, and low- dose dexamethasone regimen for an \nextended period of time resulted in deep and durable responses. All \npatients achieved at least a PR. With a median follow -up of 30.5 mont hs, \nthe reported PFS rate was 79.6% (95% CI, 53.5– 92.0) and OS was \n100%.105 \n The phase II trial by Korde et al\n81 also showed that treatment with the \ncarfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone regimen results in high rates of deep remission. The results were very similar across age groups, with the \noldest patient on the trial being 88 years of age,\n and the regimen was \nfound to be effective in individuals with high- risk disease.81  \nBased on the above phase II studies that did not exclude transplant -\nineligible patients, the NCCN Panel has included carfilzomib/ PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

The evidence for this comes from a phase \nI/II study (discussed in the previous section for HCT- eligible candidates) \nthat evaluated the safety and efficac y of the all -oral combination of \nixazomib with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with newly \ndiagnosed MM treated with combination lenalidomide and \ndexamethasone.\n106 Both tolerability and activity of this regimen in older \npatients (those ≥65 years of age) was similar to that in younger patients in \nthis study.  \nDaratumumab/ Bortezomib/ Cyclophosphamide/ Dexamethasone  \nBased on the results of the LYRA study (described above),99 the NCCN \nPanel has included \ndaratumumab/ bortezomib/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone  as a \ntreatment option for non -transplant settings.  \nRegimens Useful In Certain Circumstances for Newly Diagnosed \nNon-Transplant Candidates  \nLenalidomide/Low -Dose Dexamethasone \nThe results of the SWOG SO232 trial107 that included transplant -ineligible \npatients and the ECOG E4A03 trial108 that included older  patients with MM \ndemonstrate that lenalidomide in combination with low -dose \ndexamethasone is a well -tolerated and effective regimen for these groups \nof patients. In the ECOG E4A03 trial the OS rate was significantly higher \nin the lenalidomide plus low -dose dexamethasone arm compared with the \nlenalidomide plus high- dose dexamethasone arm.108 The inferior survival \noutcome seen with high- dose dexamethasone was greatest in patients \naged ≥65 years. At 2 years, patients who did not proceed to transplant had \nan OS rate of 91% with lenalidomide and low -dose dexamethasone.108  The international, multicenter trial (FIRST trial) evaluated efficacy and \nsafety of lenalidomide/dexamethasone given continuously for 72 weeks \nwith melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide (MPT) in older  (n = 1623) \ntransplantation- ineligible patients with newly diagnosed MM.109 The \nprimary endpoint of this trial was PFS, and secondary endpoints were OS \nand adverse events, including the incidence of secondary malignancies. \nAfter a median of 37 months of follow -up, the risk of progression or death \nwas reduced by 28% in patients receiving continuous lenalidomide/dexamethasone versus MPT (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61– 0.85; \nP < .001).\n109 Continuous lenalidomide/dexamethasone also reduced the \nrisk of progression or death compared with 18 cycles of \nlenalidomide/dexamethasone (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.89– 1.20; P = .70). In \nthe interim analysis, an OS benefit was seen in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone arm versus MPT (HR, 0.78; CI, 0.64– 0.96; P \n= .02).\n109 \nThere are several reports showing higher incidences of secondary \nmalignancies when lenalidomide is used as a maintenance therapy post -\ntransplantation or in a melphalan- containing regimen.110- 113 In the FIRST \ntrial, the overall incidence of secondary malignancies, including \nhematologic malignancies, was lower in the continuous \nlenalidomide/dexamethasone arm. The overall rates of second primary \ncancers were 3.0% in the continuous lenalidomide/dexam ethasone arm, \n6.0% in the arm receiving 18 cycles of lenalidomide/dexamethasone, and \n5.0% in the MPT arm.109 In an analysis based on renal function of patients \nenrolled in the FIRST trial, continuous lenalidomide/low -dose \ndexamethasone compared with MPT reduced the risk of progression or \ndeath in patients with normal, mild, and moderate renal impairment by \n33%, 30%, and 35%, respectively.114  \nLenalidomide/low -dose dexamethasone is considered an option useful in \ncertain circumstances (category 1) by the NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-20 for transplant -ineligible patients with MM. The panel recommends \nappropriate thromboprophylaxis for patients receiving this therapy. Based \non the results of the FIRST trial,109,115 the NCCN Panel recommends \nconsidering treatment with continuous lenalidomide/dexamethasone until disease progression for patients who are not eligible for transplant.  \nLenalidomide/Cyclophosphamide/ Dsexamethasone  \nThe efficacy and tolerability of  \ncyclophosphamide/lenalidomide/dexamethasone in newly diagnosed \npatients was demonstrated in a phase II study.  Of the 53 patients enrolled \nin the trial, 85%  had a PR or better including VGPR in 47%. The median \nPFS was 28 months (95% CI, 22.7– 32.6) and at 2 years the OS was 87% \n(95% CI, 78–96).116  \n117The Myeloma XI trial compared responses to \ncyclophosphamide/lenalidomide/dexamethasone with \ncyclophosphamide/thalidomide/dexamethasone.118 The results reported \nthat the combination of cyclophosphamide/lenalidomide/dexamethasone was associated with significantly longer PFS (median 36 vs. 33 months, P \n= .0116) and OS at 3 years (82.9% vs . 77.0%, P = .0072). \n118 \nThe NCCN Panel included lenalidomide/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone as a primary therapy \noption for patients with MM  who are not eligible for transplant under the \ncategory useful in certain circumstances (category 2A).  \nBortezomib/Dexamethasone  \nA U.S. community -based, randomized, open -label, multicenter, phase IIIb \nUPFRONT trial compared the safety and efficacy of three highly active bortezomib- based regimens in previously untreated older  patients with MM \nineligible for HCT.\n119 The patients with symptomatic, measurable MM were \nrandomized (1:1:1) to one of the following regimens: \nbortezomib/dexamethasone (n = 168); bortezomib/thalidomide/dexamethasone (n = 167); or \nmelphalan/prednisone/bortezomib (n = 167) followed by maintenance \ntherapy with bortezomib. The primary endpoint was PFS; secondary \nendpoints included ORR, CR/near CR and VGPR rates, OS, and safety. \nAll thr ee induction regimens exhibited substantial activity, with an ORR of \n73% (bortezomib/dexamethasone), 80% (bortezomib /thalidomide/dexamethasone), and 70% \n(melphalan/prednisone/bortezomib) during the treatment period.\n120 After a \nmedian follow -up of 42.7 months, the median PFS and OS were not \nsignificantly different between the three treatment arms.119 Response \nrates, including CR and greater than or equal to VGPR, improved after \nbortezomib maintenance, with no concomitant increase in the incidence of \nperipheral neuropathy.  \nWhile the triple regimen with bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone is the preferred therapy for patients with newly diagnosed MM, older or frail \npatients may be treated with doublet regimens. The NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel has included bortezomib/dexamethasone as a primary \ntherapy as an option that is useful in certain circumstances for patients \nwith MM who are ineligible for HCT. \nBortezomib/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone  \nThe role of bortezomib/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone as initial \ntherapy for patients with MM ineligible for HCT was studied in a small \nphase II trial (n = 20).\n121  The median age of patients in this study was 76 \nyears (range 66–90 years).  After a median of 5 cycles, the ORR was 95% \nwith 70% of patients achieving VGPR or better response. With respect to \ntoxicity, 6 patients experienced non- hematologic grade 3/4 adverse events \n(20%), including muscle weakness, sepsis, and pneumonia. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were seen in 2 patients (10%).\n121  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-21 Based on the above and  the results from the EVOLUTION trial74 \n(described earlier) that had included transplant -ineligible patients and the \nabove phase II trial results,121  the NCCN Panel has included \nbortezomib/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone as an option useful in \ncertain circumstances for non- transplant candidates. This option may be \nconsidered especially in patients with acute renal insufficiency or for \npatients who have no access to a PI in combination with \nlenalidomide/dexamethasone. According to the NCCN Panel, one can \nconsider switching to PI/lenalidomide/dexamethasone after renal function \nimproves.  \nCarfilzomib/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone  \nA phase II study examined the safety and efficacy of \ncarfilzomib/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone in patients ≥65 years of \nage with newly diagnosed MM and ineligible for autologous HCT.91 Out of \n55 patients, 52 (95%) had at least a PR, 39 of 55 (71%) patients had at least a VGPR, 27 of 55 (49%) patients had a near CR or CR, and 11 of 55 \n(20%) patients had an  sCR. After a median follow -up of 18 months, the 2 -\nyear PFS and OS rates were 76% and 87%, respectively.\n91 Frequently \nreported grade 3 to 5 toxicities were neutropenia (20%), anemia (11%), \nand cardiopulmonary events (7%). Peripheral neuropathy was limited to \ngrades 1 and 2 (9%).  \nThe NCCN Panel has included \ncarfilzomib/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone as an option useful in \ncertain circumstances for treatment of patients with newly diagnosed MM \nnot eligible for HCT with renal insufficiency and/or peripheral neuropathy.  Monitoring After Primary Myeloma Therapy of Both Transplant and \nNon-Transplant Candidates  \nResponse Criteria  \nAssessing the response to treatment is a key determinant of MM treatment. Patients on treatment should be monitored for response to \ntherapy and for symptoms related to disease and/or treatment.  \nThe updated IMWG response criteria definitions\n8,122,123 for CR, sCR, \nimmunophenotypic CR, molecular CR, VGPR, PR, minimal response (MR) \nfor relapsed/refractory MM, SD, and progressive disease (PD) are outlined \nin Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma in the algorithm. This has been \nupdated to include measures of MRD assessments. It is recommended that the IMWG uniform response criteria should be used in all clinical \ntrials.\n124 According to the NCCN Panel, response should be assessed \nusing the IMWG criteria.8 \nThe same imaging modality used during the initial workup should ideally be used for the follow -up assessments. Follow -up tests after primary MM \ntherapy include those used for initial diagnosis: a CBC with differential and platelet counts, blood glucose, el ectrolytes , and metabolic panel.  \nAssessing changes in levels of various proteins, particularly the M  protein, \nhelps track disease progression and response to treatment. SPEP  is used \nto track  for quantitative immunoglobulins and 24- hour urine UPEP  helps \ntrack total protein.   \nThe FLCr is required for documenting sCR according to the IMWG \nUniform Response Criteria.\n8 The serum FLC assay cannot replace the \n24-hour UPEP for monitoring patients with measurable urinary M  protein \nand can also be affected by renal function.  \nBone marrow aspirate and biopsy with FISH should be performed as \nclinically indicated, especially at relapse.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-22 Follow -up with advanced whole- body imaging (ie, FDG -PET/CT, low- dose \nCT, whole -body MRI without contrast) is recommended as needed. \nResidual focal lesions detected by either FDG -PET/CT or MRI have been \nshown to be of adverse prognostic significance.125- 128 Zamagni et al \nreported PFS of 44 months in patients with residual focal lesions on FDG -\nPET/CT versus 84 months for those without residual focal lesions on FDG -\nPET/CT after systemic treatment ( P = .0009).127 In the IMAJEM trial, both \nPFS and OS were significantly better in patients with negative FDG -\nPET/CT results before initiation of maintenance therapy ( P = .011 and P = \n.033, respectively).128 An analysis by Walker et al showed that \nconventional MRI normalizes over a prolonged period of time making \nFDG -PET/CT superior in this regard.125 However, in small cohorts, \nfunctional imaging sequence for MRI called diffusion- weighted imaging \nwas shown to have superior sensitivity to detect residual disease \ncompared with FDG -PET/CT.129- 131 Furthermore, unlike FDG -PET/CT, MRI \ndoes not expose the patient to radiation.  \nA meta -analysis of 14 studies has shown that MRD negativity predicts \nimproved PFS and OS, including in those who achieved CR.132 Therefore, \nthe NCCN P anel recommends consideration of MRD testing as indicated \nfor prognostication after shared decision- making.  \nHematopoietic Cell Transplantation  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends considering harvesting peripheral blood \nhematopoietic stem cells prior to prolonged exposure to lenalidomide \nand/or daratumumab (ie, optimally 4 or fewer induction cycles) in patients \nfor whom transplant is being considered. Collecting enough hematopoietic stem cells for two transplants (depending on the intended number of \ntransplants and age) in anticipation of a tandem transplant, boost after \ncellular therapy , or a second transplant as subsequent therapy is \nrecommended. Alternatively, all patients may consider continuation of primary therapy until the best response is reached. The optimal duration of \nprimary therapy after achieving maximal response is unknown; hence, maintenance therapy (see section on Maintenance Therapy ) or \nobservation can be considered beyond maximal response.  \nTransplant Eligibility  \nAll patients are assessed to determine eligibility for HCT. The NCCN Panel recommends that all patients eligible for HCT should be referred for \nevaluation by HCT center  and hematopoietic stem cells (for at least two \ntransplants, in younger patients) should be harvested.  \nHigh-dose therapy with HCT support is a critical component in the \ntreatment plan of eligible patients newly diagnosed with MM. The types of \nHCT may be single autologous HCT, a tandem HCT (a planned second \ncourse of high -dose therapy and HCT within 6 months  of the first course), \nor an allogeneic HCT.  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Multiple Myeloma indicate that all types of HCT \nare appropriate in different clinical settings; these indications are \ndiscussed further below. In general, all candidates for high- dose \nchemotherapy must have sufficient hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and cardiac function. However, renal dysfunction is not an absolute contraindication to \ntransplant.  \nAutologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  \nAutologous HCT results in high response rates and remains the standard of care after primary therapy for eligible patients. In 1996, results of the \nfirst randomized trial were reported; this trial demonstrated that autologous \nHCT is associated with statist ically significantly higher response rates and \nincreased OS and event -free survival (EFS) when compared with the \nresponse of similar patients treated with conventional therapy.\n133 In 2003, \nresults of a second trial comparing high- dose therapy to standard therapy \nshowed an increase in the CR rate and an improvement in OS (54 months \nin the high- dose group compared to 42 months for standard therapy).134 \nBarlogie and colleagues reported on the results of an American trial that PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-23 randomized 510 patients to receive high- dose therapy with autologous \nHCT or standard therapy.135 With a median follow -up of 76 months, there \nwere no differences in response rates, PFS, or OS between the two \ngroups. The reason for the discrepant results is not clear but may be \nrelated to differences in the specific high -dose and conventional regimens \nbetween the American and French study. For example, the American study included total body irradiation (TBI) as part of the high- dose \nregimen; TBI has subsequently been found to be inferior to high- dose \nmelphalan.\n136 \nAnother trial included 190 patients 55 to 65 years of age randomized to \nstandard or high- dose therapy.137 This study was specifically designed to \ninclude older patients, since the median age of the participants in other trials ranged from 54 to 57 years and the median age in this trial was 61 \nyears. After 120 months of follow -up, there was no significant diff erence in \nOS, although there was a trend toward improved EFS in the high- dose \ngroup ( P = .7). Additionally, the period of time without symptoms, \ntreatment, or treatment toxicity was significantly longer in the high- dose \ngroup. The study concluded that the equivalent survival suggests that the \ntreatment choice between high- dose and conventional -dose \nchemotherapy should be based on personal choice in older patients. For example, an early transplant may be favored because patients can enjoy a \nlonger interval of symptom -free time.  \nA phase III study compared high- dose melphalan followed by autologous \nHCT with MPR (melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide) consolidation \nafter induction. Patients (n = 402) were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1:1 \nratio) to one of the four groups: high- dose therapy and autologous  HCT \nfollowed by maintenance with lenalidomide; high -dose therapy and HCT \nalone; primary therapy with MPR followed by lenalidomide; and primary \ntherapy with lenalidomide alone.\n138 At a median follow -up of 51 months, \nHCT resulted in longer median PFS (43 vs. 22 months; HR 0.44; 95% CI, 0.32– 0.61) and OS (82% vs. 65% at 4 years; HR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32 –\n0.93).138 \nResults from the IFM 2005/01 study of patients with symptomatic MM receiving primary therapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone versus \nVAD showed a marked improvement in ORR with bortezomib and \ndexamethasone over VAD (see Preferred Primary Therapy Regimens for \nNewly Diagnosed Transplant Candidates ).\n139 Responses were evaluated \nafter primary treatment and post -autologous HCT. After the first \nautologous HCT, CR/near -CR rates were 35.0% in the bortezomib plus \ndexamethasone arm, compared with 18.4% in the VAD arm.139 The VGPR \nrates were 54.3% versus 37.2%. Median PFS was 36.0 months versus \n29.7 months ( P = .064) with bortezomib plus dexamethasone versus VAD \nafter a median follow -up of 32.2 months.139 Also, PFS was also \nsignificantly longer in patients achieving greater than or equal to VGPR \nafter primary treatment than in patients achieving less than VGPR (median \n36 vs. 29.7 months).139 \nIn another study, 474 patients were randomized to primary therapy with \nbortezomib/dexamethasone/thalidomide (n = 236) or \nthalidomide/dexamethasone (n = 238) before double autologous HCT and \nas consolidation therapy after HCT.140 The 3- drug regimen yielded high \nresponse rates compared with the 2 -drug regimen, with a CR rate of 19% \n(vs. 5%) and greater than or equal to VGPR of 62% (vs. 31%). After HCT, improved incremental responses were still seen with \nbortezomib/dexamethasone/thalidomide compared with thalidomide plus \ndexamethasone.\n140 The IFM 2009 phase III trial compared the efficacy and \nsafety of bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone alone versus \nbortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone plus autologous HCT for the \ntreatment of newly diagnosed MM in patients ≤65 years.141 The reported \nCR rate was 48% in the group that received induction therapy alone \nversus 59% in the transplantation group ( P = .03).

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-24 in 65% of the patients who received \nbortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone alone versus no MRD in 79% of \nthe patients who received induction therapy plus autologous HCT ( P < \n.001).141 There was a clear improvement in PFS with HCT (50 months vs. \n36 months). These results clearly show the benefit of autologous HCT, \nwith higher rates of durable responses in those with no MRD after initial \ntherapy.141 Taken together, the studies suggest that improved responses \nwith the primary regimen result in improved outcomes after transplantation \neven for patients receiving an IMiD and PI -based triplet regimen.  \nThe OS of patients in the IFM 2009 phase III trial was high in both groups, \nthe one that received autologous HCT and the one that did not.141 \nAlthough autologous HCT improved PFS it did not improve OS, suggesting that delaying HCT is an option and is not associated with \nnegative effects on OS.  \nAccording to the NCCN Guidelines, for transplant -eligible patients \nautologous HCT is the preferred option after primary induction therapy \nwhile a delayed HCT after early stem cell collection and storage is \nappropriate as well (category 1) . A repeat HCT can be considered for \ntreatment of progressive/refractory disease after primary treatment in patients with prolonged response to initial HCT.  \nTandem Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  \nTandem HCT refers to a planned second course of high- dose therapy and \nHCT within 6 months of the first course. Planned tandem transplants have \nbeen studied in several randomized trials.  The IFM94 trial reported by \nAttal et al randomized newly diagnosed patients with MM to single or tandem autologous transplants.\n142 A total of 78% of patients assigned to \nthe tandem transplant group received the second transplant at a median \ntime of 2.5 months after the first. A variety of options for therapy of \nrelapsed disease were provided. For example, relapsing patients in either  \ngroup underwent either no therapy, additional conventional therapy, or another HCT. The probability of EFS for 7 years after the diagnosis was \n10% in the single transplant group compared to 20% in the double \ntransplant group. In a subset analysis, those patients who did not achieve \na complete CR or VGPR within 3 months after the first transplant \nappeared to benefit the most from a second transplant. The investigators \nof the IFM94 study have suggested that the improvement in projected \nsurvival associated wi th tandem transplant is related not to improved \nresponse rates, but to longer durations of response. Four other randomized trials have compared single versus tandem transplant.\n137,143- 145 \nNone of these trials showed a significant improvement in OS. However, \nsince the median follow -up in these trials ranged from 42 to 53 months, \nthe lack of significant improvement is not surprising. The trial by Cavo et al\n143 found that patients not in CR or near CR after the first transplant \nbenefited the most from a second transplant. This confirms the observations of the IFM94 trial using non- TBI–based high- dose regimens. \nIn both the French and Italian trials, the benefit of a second autologous HCT was seen in patients who do not achieve a CR or VGPR (>90% \nreduction in M  protein level) with the first procedure. These two studies \nwere not adequately powered to evaluate the equivalence of one versus two transplants in patients  achieving a CR or VGPR after the first \ntransplantation.  \nA review of long- term outcomes of several trials of autologous \ntransplantation by Barlogie et al found that tandem transplantations were \nsuperior to both single transplantations and standard therapies.\n146 Also, \npost-relapse survival was longer when EFS was sustained for at least 3.5 \nyears after tandem transplantation.146-147 Results of the multicenter, phase \nIII study (EMN02/HO95 MM trial) suggested that tandem autologous HCT \nfor newly diagnosed MM may be superior in extending PFS compared with \nsingle autologous HCT after induction therapy with a bortezomib- based \nregimen.148 In another more recent study, after initial HCT patients were \nrandomly assigned to receive a second HCT followed PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

According to the NCCN Multiple Myeloma \nPanel, a tandem transplant with or without maintenance therapy can be \nconsidered for all patients who are candidates for HCT and is an option for \npatients who do not achieve at least a VGPR after the first autologous \nHCT and thos e with high -risk features. The support for use of \nmaintenance therapy after tandem transplant comes from the study by Palumbo et al,\n138 which addressed the role of maintenance therapy with \nlenalidomide after autologous transplantation.138 Although associated with \nmore frequent grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and infections, maintenance \ntherapy with lenalidomide was found to significantly reduce risk of disease \nprogression or death (HR, 0.47) after both single and tandem \ntransplantation compared w ith no maintenance.138 \nA second autologous HCT can be considered at the time of disease relapse. A retrospective case- matched control analysis was performed \ncomparing patients who underwent a second autologous HCT to those treated with conventional chemotherapy for relapsed MM.\n150 Similar to \npreviously published smaller studies,151- 153 this retrospective analysis \ndemonstrated that a second autologous HCT is associated with superior \nrelapse- associated mortality compared with conventional chemotherapy \n(68% vs. 78%), along with improved OS (32% vs. 22%) at 4 years. In this analysis, factor s associated with improved OS and PFS included younger \nage (<55 years), beta- 2 microglobulin <2.5 mg/L at diagnosis, a remission \nduration of >9 months, and a greater than PR to their first autologous HCT. This analysis indicates that a second autologous tr ansplant, for \nrelapsed or progressive MM, may be an option for carefully selected \npatients. Some of these patients can achieve durable complete or partial \nremission.\n153,154 \nA multicenter, randomized phase III trial compared treatment with high-\ndose melphalan plus second autologous HCT with cyclophosphamide in \npatients with relapsed MM who had received autologous HCT as primary \ntreatment.155 The patients included in the study were >18 years of age and \nneeded treatment for progressive or relapsed disease at least 18 months after a previous autologous HCT. All patients first received \nbortezomib/doxorubicin/dexamethasone induction therapy. Patients with \nadequately harvested hematopoieti c stem cells were then randomized to \nhigh- dose melphalan plus second autologous HCT (n = 89) or oral \ncyclophosphamide (n = 85). The primary endpoint was time to disease \nprogression.\n155 After a median follow -up of 31 months, median TTP in \npatients who underwent second autologous HCT after induction therapy \nwas 19 months versus 11 months for those treated with cyclophosphamide (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.25– 0.53; P < .0001). Grade 3– 4 \nneutropenia (76% vs. 13%) and thrombocytopenia (51% vs. 5%) were \nhigher in the group that underwent autologous HCT versus \ncyclophosphamide.\n155 Median OS in the HCT group was 67 months versus \n52 months in the cyclophosphamide maintenance group.156 \nAccording to the NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel, repeat autologous HCT \nfor relapsed disease may be considered either on or off clinical trial \ndepending on the time interval between the preceding HCT and \ndocumented progression.  \nThe prognosis of patients who relapse after autologous HCT appears to \ndiffer depending on the timing of the relapse.157- 161 Data from retrospective \nstudies162- 165 suggest 2 to 3 years as the minimum length of remission for \nconsideration of second autologous HCT for relapsed disease.

Allogeneic HCT has been investigated as an \nalternative to autologous HCT to avoid the contamination of reinfused \nautologous tumor cells, but also to take advantage of the beneficial graft -\nversus -tumor effect associated with allogeneic transplants. However, lack \nof a suitable donor and increased morbidity has limited this approach,  \nparticularly for the typical older MM population. Non- myeloablative \ntransplants are designed to decrease the morbidity of the high- dose \nchemotherapy but preserve the beneficial graft -versus- tumor effect. \nTherefore, the principal difference between myeloablative and \nnonmyeloablative transplants relates to the chemotherapy regimen used. \nSpecific preparatory regimens have not been a focus of the NCCN \nGuidelines, and therefore these guidelines do not make a distinction \nbetween these approaches.  \nGiven the small candidate pool, it is not surprising that there have been no \nrandomized clinical trials comparing myeloablative allogeneic to \nautologous HCT, but multiple case series have been published describing \nallogeneic HCT as an initial therapy or as  therapy for relapsed/refractory \nMM. In a 1999 review, Kyle et al reported a mortality rate of 25% within \n100 days and overall transplant -related mortality of approximately 40% \nand few patients were cured.166 Other reviews have also reported \nincreased morbidity without convincing proof of improved survival.167,168 \nHowever, there are intriguing data from the SWOG randomized trial of autologous transplant versus conventional chemotherapy.\n135 The original \ntrial had an ablative, allogeneic transplant group consisting of patients with \nHLA identical siblings. Thirty -six patients received allografts, and due to \nthe high 6 -month mortality of 45%, the allogeneic arm was closed. After 7 \nyears of foll ow-up the OS of the conventional chemotherapy, autologous, \nand allogeneic arms were all identical at 39%. The autologous and \nconventional chemotherapy arms do not demonstrate a plateau, whereas the allogenic curve was flat at 39%. This suggests that a proportion of \nthese patients are long- term survivors. Thus, there is ongoing interest in \nmyeloablative allogeneic HCT, particularly given the lack of a significant \ncure rate for single or tandem autologous HCT.  \nPatients whose disease either does not respond to or relapses after \nallogeneic hematopoietic cell grafting may receive donor lymphocyte \ninfusions to stimulate a beneficial graft -versus -myeloma effect169- 176 or \nother myeloma therapies on or off a clinical trial.  \nFollow -Up After Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  \nFollow -up tests after HCT are similar to those done after primary myeloma \ntherapy. MRD assessment is indicated for prognostication. Studies have shown that MRD negativity after autologous HCT translates to significantly \nimproved PFS and OS rates.\n177- 179 Similar results have also been reported \nin the allogeneic HCT setting where  the presence of MRD after allogeneic \nHCT has been associated with a significantly adverse PFS and OS.180 The \nNCCN Panel recommends assessing for MRD during follow -up as \nindicated prognostication after shared decision- making with patient .124 \nMaintenance Therapy  \nThe NCCN Panel has clarified in the algorithm section the maintenance regimens appropriate for those who received autologous HCT versus \nthose who did not and classified them as either preferred , other \nrecommended , or useful in certain circumstances.  \nMaintenance Therapy: Preferred Regimen  \nLenalidomide as Maintenance  \nLenalidomide as maintenance therapy after autologous transplantation \nhas been evaluated in two independent randomized phase III \nstudies.\n110,111 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

The median TTP in the lenalidomide group \nwas 46 months  versus 27 months in the placebo group ( P < .001). Second \nprimary cancers occurred in 18 patients who received lenalidomide (8%) and in 6 patients who received placebo (3%).\n111 \nData from the international, randomized, double- blind phase III IFM \n2005- 02 trial (n = 614) show that patients treated with lenalidomide as \nconsolidation therapy after an autologous HCT followed by lenalidomide as maintenance therapy had upgraded responses . Of the 614 patients \nenrolled in the trial, 307 were randomly assigned to lenalidomide \nmaintenance therapy and 307 to placebo. Maintenance treatment was \ncontinued until the patient withdrew consent, the disease progressed, or \nunacceptable toxic effects oc curred. The final\n analysis of the IFM 2005- 02 \ntrial was performed after a median follow -up of 30 months and 264 \npatients had disease progression (104 in the lenalidomide group and 160 \nin the placebo group).  The median PFS was 41 months in the \nlenalidomide group, compared with 23 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.50; P < .001; median follow -up period was 30 months). The probability of \nsurviving without progression for 3 years after randomization was 59% in those treated with lenalidomide and 35% in those who received the \nplacebo. The benefit of lenalidomide maintenance therapy, evidenced by \nrate of PFS at 3 years after randomization, was higher in all patients who received lenalidomide maintenance therapy compared with those who \nreceived placebo. This benefit was observed in patients who had a VGPR \nat randomization (64% vs. 49%, P = .006) and those who did not (51% vs. \n18%, P < .001).\n110 An increased incidence of second primary cancers was \nobserved in the lenalidomide group ( 32 had second primary cancers in the \nlenalidomide group and 12 in the placebo group) .110 The updated survival analysis of the same study after 91 months for follow -up reported median \nTTP of 57.3 months (95% CI, 44.2 –73.3) with lenalidomide and 28.9 \nmonths (23.0– 36.3) with placebo (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46– 0.71; P < \n.0001).181 The most common grade 3– 4 adverse events in the \nlenalidomide group compared to placebo were neutropenia (50% vs. 18%) \nand thrombocytopenia (15% vs. 5%). An increased rate of second primary \nmalignancies (hematologic plus solid tumor) were diagnosed in the \nlenalidomide group compar ed with placebo (14% vs. 4%).181 \nThe study by Palumbo et al138 (discussed in Autologous Hematopoietic \nCell Transplant ation) showed that although maintenance therapy with \nlenalidomide is associated with more frequent grade 3 or 4 neutropenia \nand infections, it significantly reduced risk of disease progression or death \n(HR, 0.47) compared with no maintenance.138 \nThe benefit of lenalidomide maintenance was studied in a meta -analysis of \ndata from 1209 patients enrolled in the trials discussed above randomized to maintenance with lenalidomide or placebo.\n182 The study showed \nimproved median PFS with lenalidomide maintenance (52.8 vs. 23.5 \nmonths; HR 0.48; 95% CI, 0.42 –0.55). At 7 years, the OS was 62% in the \ngroup receiving lenalidomide maintenance versus 50% in the group receiving placebo. In those with high- risk cytogenetics, a PFS benefit, but \nnot an OS benefit was seen with lenalidomide maintenance versus placebo.  \nThe lenalidomide group had higher rates of second primary malignancy \noccurring before progression, and the rates of PD were higher in the group \nreceiving placebo.  \nA report from the HOVON 76 trial indicates that lenalidomide maintenance \nmay not be a feasible option after mini -allogeneic HCT.\n183 However, \nanother recently reported study has shown the feasibility of maintenance PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

Maintenance with lenalidomide significantly prolonged \nPFS. The PFS of patients treated with MPL followed by maintenance \nlenalidomide was significantly prolonged (n = 152; median, 31 months) \ncompared with the other two arms: MPL (n = 153; median, 14 months; HR, \n0.49; P < .001) or MP (n = 154; median, 13 months; HR, 0.40; P < .001) . \nLenalidomide maintenance therapy improved PFS by 66% compared with placebo, regardless of age.\n185 In the FIRST trial, use of lenalidomide \nindefinitely until progression was associated with a superior PFS \ncompared with a fixed duration of 18 months.  \nThe GMMG -MM5 trial (n  = 502) examined maintenance therapy with \nlenalidomide following induction therapy and HCT in newly diagnosed \nMM patients. Patients received lenalidomide for a fixed duration of 2 \nyears or until either CR. The primary endpoint was PFS, which was not significantly different between arms after a median follow -up of 60.1 \nmonths. Higher OS was seen with lenalidomide given for 2 years than for \nlenalidomide given until CR (HR , 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04 –1.93;  P= .03). \nSerious adverse events were more  common in the group that received \nlenalidomide for 2 years versus until CR (77.6% vs . 58.2%) and included \ninfections, cardiac disorders, neuropathy, and thromboembolic events.\n186 \nBased on the evidence from the phase III trials,110,111,185 the NCCN Multiple \nMyeloma Panel lists single- agent lenalidomide as one of the preferred \nmaintenance regimens (category1) for both transplant -eligible and transplant -ineligible patients. Lenalidomide lacks the neurologic toxicity \nseen with thalidomide. However, there seems to be an increased risk for secondary cancers, especially post -transplantation,\n110- 112 or after a \nmelphalan- containing regimen.113 According to the results of the FIRST \ntrial, in the continuous lenalidomide/dexamethasone arm, the absence of \nthe alkylator melphalan seems to be more effective in terms of improving \nPFS and lowering incidence of second malignancies.109  \nA meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials examined patients treated \nwith lenalidomide maintenance versus patients with no maintenance or \nplacebo in the transplant setting.182 The analysis showed that patients \ntreated with lenalidomide maintenance had significantly improved PFS (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.41 –0.55) and a trend toward OS with lenalidomide \nmaintenance (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63– 0.90; P = .001)  versus no \nmaintenance or placebo. \n182   \nThe benefits of improved PFS with lenalidomide maintenance must be \nweighed against the increased rate of severe (grade 3 and 4) neutropenia, \nrisk of second cancers, and other toxicities.187 The NCCN Panel notes that \nthe benefits and risks of maintenance therapy with lenalidomide versus \nsecondary cancers should be discussed with patients.  \nOther Recommended Regimen for Maintenance Therapy  \nBortezomib as Maintenance Therapy  \nThe results from the HOVON study show that maintenance with single-\nagent bortezomib after autologous HCT is well tolerated and is associated \nwith improvement of ORR.90 Patients in the HOVON trial were randomly \nassigned to one of the two arms consisting of either primary treatment with \nVAD followed by autologous HCT and maintenance with thalidomide or with bortezomib/doxorubicin/dexamethasone followed by autologous HCT \nand bortezomib as maintenance therapy for 2 years.

As a general principle, if the relapse occurs at greater than 6 \nmonths after completion of the initial primary therapy, patients may be retreated with the same primary regimen.  This however does not apply to \nHCT where a longer remission would be needed to justify another transplant.  \nPreferred Regimens for Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma – After \nOne to Three P rior Therapies  \nFor patients that are still sensitive to bortezomib and/or lenalidomide, any \nof the regimens listed below may be appropriate . Since , however, \nbortezomib- containing or lenalidomide- containing regimens are often \ngiven as induction therapy, and it is likely that at relapse the disease is \nrefractory to these agents, especially if relapse is well within 6 months of \nprimary treatment completion other combinations are preferred.  \nThe NCCN Panel has provided a list of regimens for bortezomib -refractory \nand lenalidomide- refractory disease after one to three prior therapies.  \nPreferred Regimens for Bortezomib or Lenalidomide -Refractory \nDisease  \nDaratumumab/ Carfilzomib/ Dexamethasone  \nA phase 1b, open -label, non- randomized, multicenter trial first studied this \nregimen in patients (n= 82) with relapsed or refractory MM. At a median follow- up of 16 months, the overall response rate ( ORR) was 84%. In the \noverall treatment population, while the median progression free survival (PFS) was not reached, the 12- month and 18 -month PFS rates were 74% \nand 66%, respectively.197 In a multicenter, open- label phase 3 trial \n(CANDOR), the addition of daratumumab to carfilzomib plus \ndexamethasone showed deeper responses and improved PFS.198 This \nresponse has been shown to be maintained with longer follow up analyses \nof about 27 months.

After 2 years the \naddition of elotuzumab continued to show an efficacy benefit compared to \nbortezomib/dexamethasone alone with a 24% relative risk reduction in \nPFS (HR, 0.7 6; 70% CI, 0.63–0.91).\n233 \nBased on the above phase II trial data, the NCCN Panel has included \nelotuzumab/bortezomib/dexamethasone as an other recommended \nregimen for relapsed/refractory MM after one to three prior therapies.  \nIxazomib/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone  \nThis regimen has been shown to be tolerable and efficacious in newly diagnosed patients.\n95,234 A phase II study evaluated this regimen in the \nrelapsed/refractory setting in patients with a median age of 63.5 years and found that it is well tolerated.  At a median follow- up of 15.2  months in the \nphase II study, median PFS was 14.2  months. The PFS trend with this \nregimen was better in patients aged 65 and older compared with those \nless than 65 years (median 18.7  months vs. 12.0 months; HR 0.62, \nP = .14).\n235  The NCCN Panel has included this all oral regimen under the \nlist of “other recommended regimens” for relapsed/refractory MM.  \nLenalidomide/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone \nA retrospective analysis to assess the efficacy of lenalidomide in \ncombination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone showed that this \nregimen is effective in heavily pre- treated patients with manageable \nadverse effects.236 The NCCN Panel has included \ncyclophosphamide/lenalidomide/dexamethasone  treatment as an other PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

The median PFS reported was 9.5 months versus \n4.4 months. There were no significant differences in adverse event reports \nbetween the treatment arms; grade 3 and 4 anemia, neutropenia, and \nthrombocytopenia, respectively, were reported in 11%, 31%,  and 6% of \npatients treated with pomalidomide/dexamethasone and 24%, 52%, and 15% of patients treated with the triplet regimen.\n237 Similar results were \nreported by a single- center retrospective study of patients (n = 20) with \nrelapsed/refractory MM who received \npomalidomide/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone until transplant or \ndisease.238 Response to the triple- drug regimen was 63%, with nearly half \nof patients (42%) after 1 cycle with a median time to response of 3 cycles. \nOne- year median PFS was 80.7% and 65% of patients were relapse-\nfree.238 \nBased on the above phase II trial data, the NCCN Panel has included \npomalidomide/cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone as other recommended  \ntreatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory MM who have \nreceived two prior therapies, including an IMiD and a PI and disease \nprogression on/within 60 days of completion of last therapy.   Regimens Useful In Certain Circumstances for Previously Treated \nMM – Early Relapse ( one to three  prior therapies)  \nBortezomib/Liposomal Doxorubicin/Dexamethasone  \nBortezomib with liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) was approved by the FDA as \na treatment option for patients with MM who have not previously received \nbortezomib and have received at least one prior therapy. The approval \nwas based on a priority review of data fro m an international phase III trial \n(n = 646) showing that use of the combination significantly extended the median time to disease progression compared with bortezomib alone (9.3 \nvs. 6.5 months).\n239 Median duration of response was increased from 7.0 \nmonths to 10.2 months with the combination therapy. Based on these results, the NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel considers bortezomib with the \nPLD regimen as a category 1 option that is useful in certain circumstances \nfor patients with relapsed/refractory MM.  \nBortezomib/Dexamethasone  \nThe addition of dexamethasone to bortezomib in patients with relapsed/ \nrefractory MM who had PD during bortezomib monotherapy resulted in \nimprovement of response in 18% to 34% of patients.\n240- 242 The NCCN \nMultiple Myeloma Panel members have included the bortezomib and \ndexamethasone regimen as an option that is useful in certain \ncircumstances for patients with relapsed/refractory MM (category 1).  \nLenalidomide/Dexamethasone  \nLenalidomide combined with dexamethasone received approval from the FDA as a treatment option for patients with MM who had received at least \none prior treatment. This was based on the results of two studies of a total \nof 692 patients randomized to receive dexamethasone either with or \nwithout lenalidomide. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was \nTTP.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-40 American phase III trial (MM -009) in 353 previously treated patients with \nMM reported increased OS and median time to disease progression in \npatients receiving lenalidomide plus dexamethasone compared to patients \nreceiving dexamethasone plus placebo.244 Similar results were seen in the \ninternational trial MM -010.243 Patients in both of these trials had been \nheavily treated before enrollment. Many had three or more prior lines of \ntherapies with other agents and more than 50% of patients had undergone \nHCT.243,244 Most adverse events and grade 3/4 adverse events were more \nfrequent in patients with MM who received the combination of \nlenalidomide/dexamethasone compared to placebo and dexamethasone. \nThrombocytopenia (61.5%) and neutropenia (58.8%) were the most \nfrequently reported adverse events observed. The NCCN Multiple \nMyeloma Panel now considers this regimen as a category 1 option that is \nuseful in certain circumstances for patients with relapsed/refractory MM.  \nCarfilzomib /Cyclophosphamide/ Thalidomide/ Dexamethasone:  \nThe results of the phase I/II trial showed that this 4- drug regimen is \nefficacious with an ORR of 91%, with 59 % achieving VGPR or greater \nafter 4 cycles in patients with MM.245 The PFS and OS at 24 months \n(median 17.5 months) was 76% and 96%, respectively.245 This regimen \nhas now been included under the list of regimens “useful in certain \ncircumstances” for relapsed/refractory MM.   \nCarfilzomib (weekly)/dexamethasone  \nIn the phase III A.R.R.O.W. trial, patients (n = 578) with relapsed and \nrefractory MM previously treated with two or three treatments, including PI and IMiD were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive carfilzomib once a week \n(70 mg/m2) or twice a week (27 mg/m2). All patients received \ndexamethasone. The media PFS was higher in the once weekly (11.2 \nmonths) compared with those who received twice weekly carfilzomib (7. 6 \nmonths; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 -0.83; P=.0029).  The overall safety was \ncomparable between the two groups.246 The NCCN panel has included this combination on  the list of regimens “useful in certain circumstances” \nfor relapsed/refractory MM.  \nSelinexor/daratumumab/dexamethasone  \nA phase Ib/II trial assessed the safety and efficacy of adding \ndaratumumab to selinexor dexamethasone. Patients (n=34) enrolled in the trial had received three  or more prior lines of therapy, including a PI and \nan IMiD. In daratumumab naïve patients, the ORR was 73%, with 11 VGPR , and 11 PR . The median PFS was 12.5 months. This regimen has \nbeen included under the list of regimens useful in certain circumstances for relapsed/refractory MM.   \nSelinexor/ Carfilzomib/ Dexamethasone  \nIn a study of 32 patients who had received a median of four prior therapies \nwere assigned to receive once weekly selinexor, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone. The ORR  was 78% with a median PFS of 15 months. \nThe most common grade 3 or higher treatment -related adverse events \nwere thrombocytopenia (47%), nausea (6%), anemia (19%), and fatigue \n(9%).\n247 \nAnother analysis of a subset of this patient population that had triple class \nrefractory MM also showed an ORR of 66.7% with a median PFS of 13.8 \nmonths, and median OS of 33 months.248 \nThis regimen has now been included under the list of regimens “useful in \ncertain circumstances” for relapsed/refractory MM.    \nVenetoclax/ Dexamethasone with or without Daratumumab or PI for \nt(11;14) Patients  \nA phase I study of patients (n=66) with relapsed/refractory MM who \nreceived a median of 5 prior lines of therapy studied venetoclax \nmonotherapy and reported an ORR in 21% of patients with the response rate being higher in patients (n=30) with t(11;14) compared with those PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

In this phase II part of the study, patients had \nreceived a median of 5 prior lines of therapy. At a median follow -up of 9.2 \nmonths, the ORR was 48%, with a median TTP of 10.8 months.251  \nSeveral prospective trials have reported on the efficacy and tolerability of \nvenetoclax/dexamethasone containing combination regimens in relapsed \nt(11;14) MM.   A phase I  study found that venetoclax/dexamethasone in \ncombination with daratumumab with or without bortezomib produced high \nrates of durable responses in patients with relapsed or refractory MM with \nt(11;14) translocation.252 \nIn patients with no prior treatment with carfilzomib, venetoclax/dexamethasone plus carfilzomib was found to be safe and \nefficacious especially in those with t(11;14) translocations.\n253 This finding \nhas been supported by case studies.254 \nThe NCCN Panel had included venetoclax/dexamethasone with or without \ndaratumumab or a PI as options for patients with t(11:14) translocation.  \nPomalidomide/Dexamethasone  \nPomalidomide, like lenalidomide, is an analogue of thalidomide. It \npossesses potent immunomodulatory and significant anti -myeloma \nproperties.255  \nA phase III, multicenter, randomized, open- label study (MM -003) \nconducted in Europe compared the efficacy and safety of pomalidomide \nand low -dose dexamethasone (n = 302) versus high- dose dexamethasone \n(n = 153) in patients with relapsed MM who were refract ory to both \nlenalidomide and bortezomib.256 After a median follow -up of 10 months, \nPFS, the primary endpoint of the study, was significantly longer in patients who received pomalidomide and low -dose dexamethasone compared with \nthose who received high- dose dexamethasone (4 months vs. 1.9 months; \nHR, 0.45; P < .0001).256 The median OS was significantly longer in the \npatients who received pomalidomide and low -dose dexamethasone as \nwell (12.7 months vs. 8.1 months; HR, 0.74; P  = .0285).256 The most \ncommon hematologic grade 3 and 4 adverse effects found to be higher \nwith the low- dose dexamethasone compared with the high- dose \ndexamethasone were neutropenia and pneumonia.256 Other phase III \nstudies of pomalidomide plus low -dose dexamethasone in combination \nwith other agents (eg, bortezomib) are currently ongoing (Clinical Trial ID: NCT01734928). A European multicenter, single- arm, open -label, phase \nIIIb trial evaluated the saf ety and efficacy of pomalidomide and low -dose \ndexamethasone in a large patient population (N = 604).\n257 The median \nPFS reported was 4.2 months and OS was 11.9 months. Whether the patients received prior lenalidomide or bortezomib, the PFS, OS, and ORR \nreported were similar.\n257 The results of this trial are consistent with those \nobserved in the pivotal MM -003 trial.256 \nIn addition, several complementary phase II studies have been published \nevaluating the use of pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with MM relapsed/refractory to lenalidomide and/or bortezomib. A phase II \nstudy investigated two different dose regimens of pomalidomide and \ndexamethasone in 84 patients with advanced MM. Pomalidomide (4 mg) \nwas given orally on days 1 to 21 or continuously over a 28- day cycle, and \ndexamethasone (40 mg) was given orally once weekly.\n258 ORR was 35% \nand 34% for patients in the 21- day and 28 -day groups, respectively. With \na median follow -up of 23 months, median duration of response, PFS, and \nOS were 7.3, 4.6, and 14.9 months across both groups, respectively. All \npatients experienced similar adverse events in both groups. The adverse \nevents were primarily due to myelosuppression.258 Another phase II trial \nevaluated two doses of pomalidomide 2 or 4 mg/day with dexamethasone \n40 mg weekly in heavily pre- treated patients (n = 35).259 The ORR in the 2 -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

Myelosuppression \nwas the most common toxicity.259 \nThe FDA has approved pomalidomide for patients with MM who have \nreceived at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and \nbortezomib and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 \ndays of completion of the last therapy. The FDA -recommended dose and \nschedule of pomalidomide is 4 mg orally on days 1 to 21 of repeated 28-day cycles with cycles repeated until disease progression along with the \nrecommendation to monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially \nneutropenia.  \nBased on the above data, the NCCN Panel has included pomalidomide \nplus dexamethasone as a therapeutic option in patients who have \nreceived at least two prior therapies, including an IMiD and a PI, and have \ndemonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of \nthe last therapy (category 1).  \nSelinexor /Pomalidomide/ Dexamethasone  \nAn abstract presented at the 2021 ASCO Annual Meeting presented data \nfrom an ongoing phase I/II clinical trial that  contains one arm evaluating \nthe regimen of selinexor/pomalidomide/dexamethasone (NCT02343042). \nSixty -five patients were enrolled initially in phase I  with a median of three  \nprior lines of therapy . After determining a recommended phase II dose, it \nwas administered to 20 patients. Among these patients, the ORR was  \n65% and the median PFS was not reached in a median follow up of 3.9 \nmonths.\n260 Based on the above data, the NCCN Panel has included \nselinexor/pomalidomide/dexamethasone as a therapeutic option in \npatients who have received at least two prior therapies, including an IMiD \nand bortezomib, and have demonstrated disease progression on or  within \n60 days of completion of the last therapy (category 1).

Findings from \n106 patients who received 16 mg/kg noted an  ORR of 29.2% in 31 \npatients (3 sCR, 10 VGPR, and 18 PR). The median duration of response \nwas 7.4 months and median TTP was 3.7 months. The estimated 1- year \nOS rate was 65%.\n214 Adverse events reported were fatigue (39.6%), \nanemia (33.0%), nausea (29.2%), and thrombocytopenia (25.5%). Grade \n1 and 2 infusion- related reactions were seen in 42.5% of patients, mainly \nduring first infusion. No patients discontinued the study due to infusion -\nrelated reactions.214  \nBased on the above phase II results and FDA approval, the p anel has \nadded daratumumab as an option for the treatment of patients with MM \nwho have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a PI and \nan IMiD or who are double refractory to a PI and IMiD.  \nDCEP and VTD -PACE for Aggressive MM  \nPatients with an aggressive relapse may need multi -drug combinations \nsuch as DCEP,261- 263 TD-PACE (thalidomide, dexamethasone, cisplatin, \ndoxorubicin, high- dose  cyclophosphamide, and etoposide),264,265 and \nVTD-PACE (bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone, cisplatin, \ndoxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide)266- 268 for effective disease \ncontrol.  \nPreferred Regimens for Relapse After Four P rior Therapies  \nCurrently there are three  bispecific antibodies (elranatamab -bcmm, \ntalquetamab -tgvs, and teclistamab- cqyv) and two chimeric antigen \nreceptor ( CAR)  T-cell therapies (i decabtagene vicleucel  and \nciltacabtagene autoleucel) approved by the FDA and included as preferred PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

In the phase II, MagnetisMM -3 trial, patients with \nrelapsed/refractory MM received subcutaneous elranatamab once \nweekly.269 The primary population in whom the efficacy was seen were \npatients (n= 123) without prior BCMA -directed therapy. The findings \nindicated an ORR of 61.0% (75/123) and 35.0% greater than or equal to \nCR. Fifty responders switched to biweekly dosing, and 40 of  those (80.0%) \nimproved or maintained their response for ≥ 6 months. Common adverse \nevents reported were infections, cytokine release syndrome, anemia, and \nneutropenia. With biweekly dosing, grade 3 –4 adverse events decreased \nfrom 58.6% to 46.6%.269  \nTalquetamab- tgvs: Talquetamab is a T cell redirecting bispecific antibody \ntargeting both GPRC5D  and CD3 on T cells .

The toxicity was mild and \nmainly hematologic. A retrospective analysis of 39 patients has reported that bendamustine is effective and tolerable in patients with advanced \nprogressive MM, with an ORR of 36%.\n276 \n The ECOG studied treatment with high- dose cyclophosphamide in \npatients with poor -risk features who had disease that was refractory to \nprior chemotherapy.277 The ORR reported was 43% (29% response rate in \npatients refractory to prior therapy with cyclophosphamide).277 \nBendamustine is currently a treatment option for relapsed/refractory MM.  \nBendamustine/Bortezomib/Dexamethasone  \nA phase II study evaluated bendamustine/bortezomib/dexamethasone administered over six 28 -day cycles and then every 56 days for 6 more \ncycles in patients (n = 75; median age 68 years) with relapsed/refractory \nMM treated with multiple prior therapies and not refractory to bortezomib. \nThe PR rate was 71.5% (16% CR, 18.5% VGPR, 37% partial remission). \nAt 12 -month follow -up, median TTP was 16.5 months, and 1 -year OS was \n78%.\n278 \nBendamustine/carfilzomib/dexamethasone  \nA multicenter trial evaluated combination therapy with \nbendamustine/carfilzomib/and dexamethasone in 63 patients with \nrelapsed/refractory MM (with at least two  lines of prior therapy).

A total of 122 patients were included in \nthe intent -to-treat popula tion. PR or better was observed in 26% of \npatients (95% CI, 19 - 35 with  sCR in 2%, VGPR in 5%, and PR in 20% of \nthe patients.  \nThe most common adverse events reported during treatment were \nthrombocytopenia in 73% of the patients, fatigue in 73%, nausea in 72%, \nand anemia in 67%.  \nBased on the above results, the NCCN Panel has included \nselinexor/dexamethasone under other recommended options for patients \nwith relapsed/refractory MM who have received at least four prior \ntherapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two PI , at least two \nimmunomodulatory agents, and an anti -CD38 monoclonal antibody.\n247 Regimens Useful in Certain Circumstances for Relapse After Four  \nPrior Therapies  \nBelantamab Mafodotin- blmf \nBelantamab mafodotin- blmf is a  BCM A antibody, conjugated to a \nmicrotubule disrupting agent — monomethyl auristatin—via a stable, \nprotease resistant linker. It is the first in its class. In the open- label phase II \ntrial (DREAMM -2), belantamab mafodotin was evaluated in patients whose \nMM was r efractory to multiple agents. Responses were seen in \napproximately one- third of patients.284 The most common grade 3/4 \nadverse events in the safety population were keratopathy, \nthrombocytopenia, and anemia.284 \nIn November 2022,  it was announced that belantamab mafodotin- blmf is \nbeing withdrawn as it did not meet the primary end point of having a \nsuperior PFS compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone in the \nDREAMM -3 trial (HR 1.03; 95% CI, 0.72 –1.47). The PFS with belantamab \nmafodot in-blmf was 11.2  months compared with 7 months for \npomalidomide plus dexamethasone, however this was not statistically \nsignificant.  Since, patients already receiving belantamab mafodotin- blmf \nand those enrolled on the FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy \n(REMS) program have been able to continue to receive the drug through \na compassionate use program .  There are other ongoing trials with \nbelantamab mafodotin- blmf, the NCCN Panel has included this as an \noption useful in certain circumstance for those after 4 prior therapies  \n(including a PI, an IMiD, and an anti -CD38 monoclonal antibody).  \nSupportive Care for Multiple Myeloma  \nImportant advances have been made in adjunctive treatment/supportive \ncare of patients with MM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-46 categorized into those measures required for all patients and those that \naddress specific drugs.  \nBony manifestations in the form of diffuse osteopenia and/or osteolytic lesions develop in 85% of patients with MM. Related complications are the \nmajor cause of limitations in quality of life and performance status in \npatients with MM. A large, double- blind, randomized trial has shown that \nmonthly use of IV pamidronate (a bisphosphonate) can decrease pain and bone- related complications, improve performance status, and, importantly, \npreserve quality of life in patients with Durie- Salmon stage III MM and at \nleast one lytic lesion.\n285,286 Zoledronic acid has equivalent benefits.287 \nResults from the study conducted by Zervas et al288 show a 9.5- fold \ngreater risk for the development of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) with \nzoledronic acid compared to pamidronate. Patients who are on \nbisphosphonates should have their renal function monitored. They should \nhave a dental exam prior to the start of bisphosphonate therapy and \nshould be monitored for ONJ.  \nThe Medical Research Council (MRC) Myeloma IX study examined effects \nof zoledronic acid versus clodronate (a bisphosphonate not currently FDA \napproved) in patients with MM initiating chemotherapy regardless of bone \ndisease. The patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid (n = \n981) or clodronic acid (n = 979). Zoledronic acid was reported to reduce \nmortali ty and significantly improve PFS.289 Patients on clodronate and \nzoledronic acid had similar occurrence of acute renal failure and treatment -related serious adverse events. Zoledronic acid was associated \nwith higher rates of ONJ than was clodronic acid.\n290 An extended follow- up \n(median, 5.9 years) of the MRC Myeloma IX showed significant \nimprovement in OS (52 vs. 46 months; HR, 0.86; P = .01) compared with \nclodronic acid.291 The long- term rates of ONJ were also observed to be \nhigher with zoledronic acid compared with clodronate (3.7% vs. 0.5%; \nP=.0001).291 A recent meta -analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials comparing \nbisphosphonates with either placebo or a different bisphosphonate as a comparator concluded that adding bisphosphonates to the treatment of \nMM reduces vertebral fractures and probably reduces pain.\n292 It did not \nfind a particular bisphosphonate to be superior to another.292 In a \nmulticenter trial (CALGB 70604), patients with MM or bone metastases \nfrom a solid malignancy were randomly assigned to zoledronic acid \neither monthly  or every 3 months for 2 years.293 The rates of skeletal -\nrelated events  (SRE)  were similar in both arms. Among the 278 patients \nwith MM, rates of SRE were 26% in those receiving monthly versus 21% \nin those receiving treatment every 3 months.293 \nA large, placebo- controlled, randomized trial compared denosumab with \nzoledronic acid in patients (n = 1718) with newly diagnosed MM with bone \nlesions. Time to first  SRE and OS w ere similar in both arms. The \ndenosumab arm had lower rates of renal toxicity and higher rates of hypocalcemia. ONJ was slightly higher in the denosumab arm (3% vs. 2%) \nbut not statistically significant.\n294 \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Multiple Myeloma recommend bisphosphonates \n(category 1) or denosumab for all patients receiving therapy for \nsymptomatic MM regardless of documented bone disease. Denosumab is \npreferred by the NCCN Panel in patients with renal diseas e. The NCCN \nPanel recommends a baseline dental exam and monitoring for ONJ in all patients receiving a bone -modifying agent and monitoring for renal \ndysfunction with use of bisphosphonate therapy.  With respect to duration \nof therapy, the panel also recommends continuing bone- targeting \ntreatment (bisphosphonates or denosumab) for up to 2 years and continuing beyond 2 years would be based on clinical judgement. The \nfrequency of dosing (monthly vs. every 3 months) would depend on the \nindividual patient criteri a and response to therapy.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-47 Excess bone resorption from bone disease can lead to excessive release \nof calcium into the blood, contributing to hypercalcemia. Symptoms \ninclude polyuria and gastrointestinal disturbances, with progressive \ndehydration and decreases in glomerular filtration rate. Hypercalcemia \nshould be treated with hydration, bisphosphonates, denosumab,294 \nsteroids, and/or calcitonin. Among the bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and ibandronate), the NCCN Multiple Myeloma Panel \nmembers prefer zoledronic acid for treatment of hypercalcemia.\n287,295,296 \nThe NCCN P anel has provided general principles of palliative RT  for \npatients with MM. Careful planning of the  radiation field and radiation \ntechnique is important  to minimize toxicity to the spinal cord, brain, bone \nmarrow, and  adjacent organs at risk ( OAR ) as patients with MM may be \ntreated multiple times during their disease course.  The panel has noted \nthat initiation of s ystemic therapy should not be delayed for RT and can \noften be given concurrently  and that patients should be carefully \nmonitored for t oxicities.297,298 Low-dose RT (8 Gy x 1 fraction) or 20 –30 \nGy in 5 –10 total fractions can be used as palliative treatment for \nuncontrolled pain, for impending pathologic  fracture, or for impending \ncord compression. Moderately fractionated courses of 20 -25 Gy in 8- 10 \nfractions are generally preferred over higher doses (30  Gy) absent \nextenuating circumstances (e.g., severe symptomatic cord compression) \nto limit unnecessary toxicity and reduce risk of future treatment of  \nadjacent or overlapping OAR  (e.g., spinal cord).299 For RT dose \nconstraint suggestions regarding bone marrow and other OAR, see \nNCCN Guidelines for Hodgkin Lymphoma .  \nPlasmapheresis should be used as adjunctive therapy for symptomatic hyperviscosity.\n300 Institutions differ in their use of plasmapheresis for \nadjunctive treatment of renal dysfunction.  \nErythropoietin therapy may be considered for anemic patients, especially \nthose with renal failure. Measuring endogenous erythropoietin levels may also be helpful in treatment planning301,302 (see NCCN Guidelines for \nPrevention and Treatment of Cancer -Related Infections ). Daratumumab \ncan interfere with cross -matching and RBC antibody screening. The \nNCCN Panel recommends performing type and screen prior to receiving \ndaratumumab to inform future matching.  \nThe highest risk for venous thromboembolism ( VTE) is in the first 6 \nmonths following new diagnosis of MM . The NCCN Panel has outlined \nmanagement of VTE, risk stratification, and VTE prophylaxis  in a separate \nsection in the NCCN Guidelines for Multiple Myeloma (see nccn.org) and \nVTE prophylaxis is administered to all patients,  assuming there are no \ncontraindications to anticoagulation agents or anti -platelets (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Cancer -Associated Venous Thromboembolic Disease).  \n \nTo prevent infections in patients with MM, the panel recommends referring \nto the NCCN Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Cancer -Related \nInfections , the CDC recommendations for CDC for Use of COVID -19 \nVaccines in the US, and in the most recent update, the panel has outlined \nrecommendations for prophylaxis and management of infections in \npatients undergoing treatment with CAR T -cell and bispecific ant ibody.  \nManagement of Renal Disease in Multiple Myeloma \nIn patients with MM and monoclonal gammopathies, renal disease usually results from the production of monoclonal immunoglobulin or light/heavy \nchains by a clonal proliferation of plasma cells or B cells. Renal disease is \nseen in 20% to 50% of patients with MM and has been observed to \nnegatively affect outcomes.\n303- 305 The NCCN Panel has added a new page \noutlining management of renal disease in MM.  \nRenal insufficiency defined as elevated serum creatinine greater than 2 mg/dL or established glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-48 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients with MM is usually due to light chain cast \nnephropathy, but other etiologies need to be considered including \nhypercalcemia, volume depletion, and hyperuricemia as well as \nnephrotoxic medications or IV contrast. In addition, concomitant \namyloid osis and monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition should be \nsuspected when renal insufficiency or albuminuria is present without high levels of light chains.  \nDiagnostic Tests \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, diagnostic workup of patients with \nsymptomatic MM should include serum creatinine, electrolyte \nmeasurements, eGFR, electrophoresis of a sample from a 24 -hour urine \ncollection, serum electrophoresis, and serum FLC  measurement. If \nproteinuria predominantly consists of light chains with high serum levels of \nFLC, and the cause of renal insufficiency can be attributed to MM, a renal \nbiopsy may not be necessary. However, patients without a clear and complete explanation for their renal insufficiency should undergo renal \nbiopsy to look for other pathophysiology such as monoclonal \nimmunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD) or membranoproliferative \nglomerulonephritis (MPGN).  \nTreatment Options  \nThe initial treatment of cast nephropathy includes initiating appropriate MM \ntherapy and providing adequate supportive care.  \nMyeloma Therapy : Bortezomib  and/or a daratumumab- containing regimen \ncan be administered in patients with severe renal impairment and also \nthose on dialysis and does not require renal dose adjustment.\n306- 310 Once \nthe renal function improves or stabilizes, one can switch to other regimens.  \nAgents used in myeloma therapy should be used with caution and with \ndose adjustments based on the degree of renal function impairment as recommended by the IMWG.\n311 A retrospective study evaluated \nlenalidomide and dexamethasone based on two phase III trials of \nlenalidomide/low -dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory \nMM with a serum creatinine of <2.5 mg/dL. Patients grouped by creatinine clearance >60 mL/min (n  = 243), 30– 60 mL/min (n  = 82), and <30 mL/min \n(n = 16) showed no difference in response rates to lenalidomide/low -dose \ndexamethasone.\n312 Patients with renal insufficiency had higher rates of \nthrombocytopenia and lenalidomide discontinuation than seen in patients \nwithout renal insufficiency. The NCCN Panel has outlined \nrecommendations for lenalidomide dosing based on the degree of renal function in patients with MM and renal impairment. While prospective data \nto define optimal dosing are often lacking, pomalidomide has been studied \nin patients with relapsed MM in three different categories of renal \ninsufficiency (eGFR 30– 40 mL/min/1.73 sqm, eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 \nsqm, and those requiring dialysis) and ful l-dose pomalidomide of 4 mg \ndaily was found to be safe in all three groups.\n313   \nSupportive Care: I V fluids should be started promptly to decrease the \nrenal tubular light chain concentration with a goal urine output of 100 to \n150 cc per hour. Careful assessment of the fluid status is critical to avoid \nhypervolemia,  especially in patients with oliguria renal failure.  \nIn addition, nephrotoxic medications should be discontinued and other metabolic abnormalities such as hypercalcemia and hyperuricemia should \nbe corrected. Hydration, bisphosphonates or denosumab, and calcitonin \nare recommended to reduce calcium levels in t he case of hypercalcemia. \nIn patients with renal disease, pamidronate and zoledronic acid should be \nused with caution. The NCCN Panel has provided the recommended \ndosing of these agents in those who have renal impairment.  \nDialysis may be required in selected patients in addition to prompt \ninstitution of anti -myeloma therapy.

Previously MGCS were \nall grouped under MGUS. Monoclonal gammopathy affects the renal function, and it is referred to as MGRS. Peripheral neuropathy mediated \nby a M protein in the serum and urine without any evidence of MM or WM \nis now defined as monoclonal gammopathy of neurological significance \n(MGNS).  \n \nMonoclonal Gammopathy of Renal Significance (MGRS)  \nThe term “ MGRS ” was proposed by the International Kidney and \nMonoclonal Gammopathy Research Group to collectively describe \npatients who meet the criteria for MGUS but demonstrate renal injury \nattributable to the underlying M protein.314  \nWhen the presence of monoclonal gammopathy affects the renal function, it is referred to as MGRS. Renal damage in the setting of symptomatic MM \nis not considered MGRS.  Initial Workup  \nIn patients suspected of having MGRS, kidney biopsy is performed. A \nkidney biopsy is essential in demonstrating the nephrotoxicity of the M \nprotein. The biopsy may be deferred if the eGFR is stable, the urinalysis is normal , or there is no evidence of proteinuria (it  is not always light chain \nproteinuria).  \nThe presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits in the kidney indicates the existence of a plasma cell, B cell, or lymphoplasmacytic \nclone that is responsible for the production of the M protein.  \nM protein must be detected by electrophoresis and immunofixation in the \nurine and serum and must be correlated with the one found in biopsy. \nImmunofluorescence staining should be performed with the biopsy sample \nfor IgG subclasses, IgA and IgM, and kappa and  lambda.  \nImaging by PET/CT, low -dose CT, or whole- body MRI should be \nperformed as clinically indicated. Bone marrow biopsy is carried out if suspected to have MM or WM.   \nAdditional workup for appropriate diagnosis of suspected WM, CLL/SLL, \nor systemic light chain amyloidosis maybe carried out as outlined in the \nrespective NCCN Guidelines (see NCCN Guidelines for Waldenström \nMacroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma,  NCCN Guidelines for \nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, and \nNCCN Guidelines for Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis ). \nTreatment  \nThe treatment of MGRS is directed at the underlying plasma cell or B -cell \nclones to improve or prevent further kidney damage in these patients.

A \nsingle -center retrospective analysis suggests that approximately 69% of \npatients with MGNS showed demyelinating features while 26% showed axonal features.\n315 As a precursor state to numerous B -cell disorders, \nsuspected MGNS does not always necessitate pharmacotherapy, but does warrant additional workup and evaluation to rule out other causes \nof neuropathy and inform clinical decision -making.  \nInitial Workup  \nMGNS may be the result of other comorbidities or conditions such as \ndiabetes, cobalamin deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, Lyme disease, HIV \ninfection, syphilis, autoimmune disease, or cryoglobulinemia. A comprehensive assessment of other causes of neuropathy is needed, including an evaluation for light chain amyloidosis, WM, or POEMS  \n(Polyneuropathy,  Organomegaly,  Endocrinopathy,  Monoclonal \nprotein,  Skin changes ) syndrome. Additional components of an initial \nworkup include anti -MAG antibodies, ganglioside antibody panel, nerve \nconduction study (NCS) or electromyogram (EMG), neurology consult, and chest/abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast (if possible). Sural nerve biopsy may be considered in certain circumstances. A nerve biopsy is a \nless desirable diagnostic method due to the association with pain and potential permanent sensory or motor deficits.\n316  \nMYD88  L265P  allele -specific PCR testing of bone marrow is included in \nthe initial workup of a patient with suspected MGNS. A study analyzed the \ncorrelation of MYD88  L265P  mutation in a large number of tumor samples \nacross a variety of B -cell disorders and reported higher levels of IgM ( P < \n.0001) and higher frequency of proteinuria ( P = .002) in patients with the \nmutation compared to patients with wild- type MYD88 . The incidence of \nMYD88 L265P  mutation was reported in 100% of patients with WM, 47% \nof patient s with MGUS, 6% with splenic marginal zone lymphoma, and 4% \nof patients with B -cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders.317 Subsequent \nstudies have also reported the strong correlation of MYD88 mutation status in MGNS and WM.\n318- 320 It should be noted that wild- type MYD88  \noccurs in less than 10% of patients and should not be used to exclude \ndiagnosis of WM if other criteria are met.  \nCXCR4  gene mutation testing may be considered in certain circumstances \ndue to its prevalence in MGNS. Several studies reported CXCR4  gene \nmutation as a common somatic mutation that has been linked with the \nMYD88  L265P  mutation.319-323 Notably , however, a study reported that \nCXCR4 mutation status had no impact on risk of death.320 Therefore, \nCXCR4  gene mutation testing may be included in the initial workup of a \npatient with suspected MGNS but should be interpreted in the context of \nother clinical findings to confirm diagnosis. \nClinical Findings  \nIf there is either low suspicion or intermediate suspicion of MGNS that \ndoes not affect activities of daily living (ADLs), observation and follow -up \nas clinically indicated is appropriate. A low suspicion of MGNS may be \ndetermined if the following clinical  findings are present: motor/pain \npredominant, non -length dependent, rapid progression (weeks to months), PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2026 \nMultiple Myeloma  \n \nMS-51 unilateral or asymmetrical, antibodies not present, and no demyelination \nconfirmed by EMG/NCS.  \nIf there is either intermediate suspicion that affects ADLs or high suspicion \nof MGNS, please refer to the NCCN Guidelines for Waldenström \nMacroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma. A high suspicion of \nMGNS may be determined if the following clinical findings are present: sensory predominant, length dependent, slow progression (years), bilateral and symmetrical, antibodies present, and demyelination \nconfirmed by EMG/NCS . Presence of the MYD88  L265P  and/or CXCR4  \nmutations should also be considered in the further diagnosis of WM.  \n \nPOEMS Syndrome  \nPOEMS syndrome is a rare plasma cell disorder that is characterized by \nthe dominant presence of demyelinating peripheral neuropathy and confirmed clonal plasma cell proliferation. The etiology is not well \nunderstood, but it is believed to be correlated wit h inflammatory cytokines, \nsuch as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Despite the individual \ncomponents of the acronym, not all of the features are necessary to make a diagnosis of POEMS syndrome. There are also other important features \nthat are not  included in the acronym. Because of its rarity, POEMS \nsyndrome may be underdiagnosed and mistaken for other chronic inflammatory syndromes.\n324- 326 \nThe diagnosis of POEMS syndrome is confirmed when both mandatory \nmajor criteria, one of the other three major criteria, and one of the six minor criteria are present. The mandatory major criteria for diagnosis of POEMS syndrome include the presence of poly neuropathy (typical \ndemyelinating) and monoclonal plasma cell  proliferative disorder [almost \nalways λ (lambda)]. Additionally, at least one of the following major criteria is required: Castleman disease, sclerotic bone lesions, and/or VEGF elevation. Minor  criteria for diagnosis that may be present include \norganomegaly (ie, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy ), extravascular volume overload (eg, edema, pleural effusion, ascites ), \nendocrinopathy (ie, adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, gonadal, parathyroid, \npancreatic ), skin changes (ie, hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, \nglomeruloid hemangiomata, plethora, acrocyanosis, flushing, white nails ), \npapilledema, and/or thrombocytosis/polycythemia. Other signs and \nsymptoms may include clubbing, weight loss, hyperhidrosis, pulmonary \nhypertension, restrictive lung disease, thrombotic diatheses, diarrhea, \nand/or low vitamin B12 levels.\n325 \nInitial Workup  \nIf POEMS syndrome is suspected, a complete history and physical \nexamination is warranted. Clinical findings should be evaluated for potential correlation to organomegaly (including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy). Presentation of symptoms such as hyperhidrosis, diarrhea, weight loss, and menstrual/sexual dysfunction \nshould be accounted for in the initial workup. Fundoscopic, skin, and neurologic examinations may be performed to identify abnormalities. \n325 \nRecommended initial testing beyond the initial workup includes electrophysiologic (nerve conduction) studies, CT of the \nchest/abdomen/pelvis (for lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, ascites, pleural effusion, and/or edema), echocardiography (for right ventricul ar \nsystolic and pulmonary artery pressures), and CT body bone windows \nand/or FDG -PET/CT (for sclerotic bone lesions). Laboratory testing should \ninclude a CBC, complete metabolic panel, fasting glucose, serum \nimmunoglobulins ( ie, IgG, IgA, IgM), electrophoresis and immunofixation, \nserum FLC, 24- hour urine total protein, VEGF, interleukin- 6 (IL-6), and \nnumerous hormones ( ie, testosterone, estradiol, thyroid- stimulating \nhormone, parathyroid hormone, prolactin, serum cortisol, luteinizing hormone). A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, FISH panel, and PCR \nshould be done to assess for MM.\n325 \nAdditional testing may be considered, if indicated. These additional tests \ninclude sural nerve biopsy, follicle- stimulating hormone, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:48:53 PM.
