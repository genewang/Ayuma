Multiphase IV contrast delivery may facilitate disease delineation. MRI may be complementary to CT in target delineation.\n ◊3rd bullet added: Unless there is a contraindication to IV contrast, CT  simulation with 2–3 mm slices should be performed with IV contrast whenever \nfeasible (assuming adequate kidney function). Multiphase IV contrast delivery is preferred whenever possible to facilitate disease delineation, where \nclinically appropriate. MRI imaging may be complimentary to CT in target delineation. Neutral oral contrast may also be utilized.\n\u0017Planning, Dose, and Fractionation:\n ◊1st bullet modified: 3D-CRT, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), and stereotactic body RT (SBRT) can result in improved planning target volume (PTV) \ncoverage with decreased dose to OARs. IMRT is preferred over 3D-CRT for conventional or hypofractionated RT, particularly if dose escalation is \nbeing considered . The exact planning strategy used should be individualized to patient anatomy, clinical scenario, treatment goals, and dose goals.\nCONTINUEDPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

Resections should be done at institutions that \nperform a large number (at least 15–20) of pancreatic resections and/or endoscopic and surgical ampullectomy annually. \n• High-quality dedicated imaging of the ampullary region should be performed at presentation (even if standard CT imaging is already \navailable), preferably within 4 weeks of surgery, and following neoadjuvant treatment to provide adequate staging and assessment \nof resectability status. Imaging should be done prior to stenting, when possible. Imaging with contrast as appropriate for disease \nmanagement (unless contraindicated).\n• Imaging should include dedicated pancreatic CT of abdomen (preferred) or MRI with contrast.\n\u0017Multi-detector CT (MDCT) angiography, performed by acquiring thin, preferably sub-millimeter, axial sections using a dual-phase \npancreatic protocol, with images obtained in the pancreatic and portal venous phase of contrast enhancement, is the preferred imaging \ntool for dedicated pancreatic imaging.a Scan coverage can be extended to cover the chest and pelvis for complete staging as per \ninstitutional preferences. Multiplanar reconstruction is preferred as it allows precise visualization of the relationship of the primary tumor \nto the mesenteric vasculature as well as detection of subcentimeter metastatic deposits. See MDCT Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Protocol, \nAMP-A (3 of 8).\n\u0017MRI is most commonly used as a problem-solving tool, particularly for characterization of CT-indeterminate liver lesions or when contrast-\nenhanced CT cannot be obtained (as in cases with severe allergy to iodinated intravenous [IV] contrast material). This preference for \nusing MDCT as the main imaging tool in many hospitals and imaging centers is mainly due to the higher cost and lack of widespread \navailability of MRI compared to CT. See MRI Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Protocol, AMP-A (4 of 8).\n• The decision regarding resectability status should be made by consensus at multidisciplinary meetings/discussions following the \nacquisition of dedicated ampullary imaging including complete staging. Use of a radiology staging reporting template is preferred to ensure \ncomplete assessment and reporting of all imaging criteria essential for optimal staging, which will improve the decision-making process.a \nSee Pancreatic Cancer Radiology Reporting Template, AMP-A (5 of 8).

Local extent of the lesion may be assessed with endoscopy with image enhancement, and with EUS and MRI/MRCP for intraductal \nand submucosal invasion. EUS may be considered in all lesions, which may be endoscopically removed, to assess intraductal or parenchymal \ninvasion. If deep invasion is suspected, EUS with biopsies may be pursued at that time. Endoscopic removal of ampullary adenomas should \nbe performed at a high-volume center.1-3\nThe goals of pancreatoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater include an oncologic resection of the primary tumor and \nregional lymph nodes. Careful intraoperative staging should rule out peritoneal, liver, and distant lymph node metastases, and resection of \nthe primary tumor should only be done in the absence of distant disease. Surgery should be done efficiently , minimizing blood loss, operative \ntime, and cost. Management of a soft pancreatic remnant should be anticipated. \nPancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple technique)\nThe goals of surgical extirpation of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater focus on the achievement of an R0 resection, as a margin-positive \nspecimen is associated with poor long-term survival.4,5 Achievement of a margin-negative dissection must focus on meticulous perivascular \ndissection of the lesion similar to pancreatic cancer, recognition of the need for vascular resection and/or reconstruction, and the potential \nneed for extra-pancreatic organ resection. Medial dissection of pancreatic head lesions is best achieved by complete mobilization of the PV \nand SMV from the uncinate process (assuming no evidence of tumor infiltration). Skeletalization of the lateral, posterior , and anterior borders \nof the SMA down to the level of the adventitia will maximize uncinate yield and radial margin.6,7\n• The need for lateral venorrhaphy or complete portal or SMV resection and reconstruction to achieve an R0 resection may be suggested \nbut is often not known until division of the pancreatic neck has occurred. Tethering of the carcinoma to the lateral wall of the PV while \nuncommon, requires careful dissection to free the vein from the pancreatic head if it is possible to do so. Differentiation of tumor infiltration \ninto the vein wall from tumor-related desmoplasia is frequently impossible to ascertain. Data support an aggressive approach to partial or \ncomplete vein excision if tumor infiltration is suspected.\nConsider frozen section analysis of the pancreatic neck and bile duct. To avoid cautery artifact that may confound the frozen section, assess \nthe pancreatic neck and bile duct at time of surgery by frozen section approximately 5 mm from the transection margin. If tumor is located \nwithin 5 mm of margins, consider further excision of the pancreas and bile duct to ensure at least 5 mm of clearance. \nReferences on AMP-C 2 of 2PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

Radial, rather than en face, sections of this margin will more clearly demonstrate how closely this margin is \napproached by tumor. The uncinate margin should be inked. Rather than being submitted en face, the uncinate margin tissue should \nbe shaved/amputated, then the portion of tissue should be sectioned perpendicular to the ink and submitted entirely for histologic \nexamination.\n ◊PV Margins: If an en bloc partial or complete vein resection is added to the surgical specimen, it should be marked separately. En face \nproximal and distal end margins of the vein should be separately submitted as “Proximal Portal Vein Margin” and “Distal Portal Vein \nMargin.” A section documenting tumor invasion into the vein wall should also be submitted. \n ◊Pancreatic Neck (transection) Margin: This is the en face section of the transected pancreatic neck. Care should be taken when placing \nthe section into the cassette to document the orientation of the section with respect to the true margin (eg, facing down so that the initial \nsection into the block represents the true margin, or facing up so that the initial section represents the surface opposite the true margin).\n ◊Bile Duct Margin: This is the en face section of the bile duct end. The section should be removed from the unopened duct and care \nshould be taken when placing the section into the cassette to document the orientation of the section with respect to the true margin \n(eg, facing down so that the initial section into the block represents the true margin, or facing up so that the initial section represents the \nsurface opposite the true margin).\n\u0017Other margins analyzed in pancreatoduodenectomy specimens include the proximal (gastric or enteric) and distal enteric margins (en face \nsections).\n\u0017Collectively, these margins and pancreatic tissue surfaces constitute the circumferential surface of the specimen. Designating the various \nspecific margins and surfaces with different colored inks will allow recognition on microscopy .\nAMP-D\n2 OF 6PATHOLOGIC ANALYSIS: SPECIMEN ORIENTATION, HISTOLOGIC SECTIONS, AND REPORTING\nReferences on AMP-D 6 of 6PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

This surface is not a true margin, but identification and reporting \nof this surface when positive is recommended, but not currently required, for data collection purposes, so that the association with \nrisk of recurrence and other prognostic indicators can be studied. Radial, rather than en face, sections of this surface will more clearly \ndemonstrate whether it is involved by tumor. In some instances, this surface may already be included in sections of the SMA margin.\n\u0017SMV Groove: Also referred to as the vascular groove surface, this is the smooth-surfaced groove on the posterior-medial surface of the \npancreatic head that rests over the SMV. This surface is not a true margin, but identification and reporting of this surface when positive is \nrecommended, but not currently required, for data collection purposes, so that the association with risk of recurrence and other prognostic \nindicators can be studied. Radial, rather than en face, sections of this surface will more clearly demonstrate whether it is involved by tumor , \nand also will provide the distance of the tumor from the surface. As is true for the posterior (non-SMA margin) surface, in some instances, \nthis surface may be included in the same sections as the SMA margin.\n\u0017Anterior Surface: The anterior surface is not a true margin, but identification and reporting of this surface when positive is recommended, \nbut not currently required, for data collection purposes, so that the association with risk of recurrence and other prognostic indicators can \nbe studied. In some cases where the anterior surface is adherent to other structures, from which it is surgically dissected or transected, it \nshould be considered an additional circumferential margin, for which the closest distance from tumor should be reported.\n• Histologic Sectioning\n\u0017The approach to histologic sectioning is determined by the unique characteristics of the tumor , but is also influenced by institutional \npreferences, expertise, and experience. For examination of ampullary carcinoma, it is recommended that the pancreas be bivalved along \nprobes placed in the bile and pancreatic ducts, with sections submitted in a manner that allows for determination of the extent of invasion \ninto the sphincter of Oddi, duodenal wall, and pancreas, as well as the relationship between invasive carcinoma and any precursor lesions \nfrom which it may be arising, and the relationship to the pancreatic circumferential tissue margins mentioned above. \n\u0017Tumor clearance should be reported with millimeter accuracy for all margins where tumor is close (within ≤1.0 cm of the tumor). This may \nbe done using either mm (eg, \"2 mm\") or cm (eg, \"0.2 cm\"). For margins distant from tumor (>1.0 cm from tumor), tumor clearance may be \nreported with centimeter accuracy.\n\u0017Attached organs resected with the specimen en bloc require serial sectioning to assess not only direct extension, but metastatic deposits \nas well. One section that demonstrates direct invasion of the organ and/or a separate metastatic deposit is required.\nAMP-D\n3 OF 6PATHOLOGIC ANALYSIS: SPECIMEN ORIENTATION, HISTOLOGIC SECTIONS, AND REPORTINGPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

Abundant desmoplastic stroma may be present. They may exhibit an \nimmunophenotypic staining profile (positive for MUC1 and negative for CDX2 and MUC2, irrespective of CK20 staining) similar to that \nof pancreatic/biliary carcinomas.8-10 It should be noted that a significant proportion of ampullary adenocarcinomas may be of mixed \nor ambiguous phenotype.5,8,9 These ambiguous cases should be classified as tubular adenocarcinoma with mixed features,9 but we \nrecommend that the predominant pattern be noted in the pathology report for data collection purposes and future analysis.\n• Current data on the independent prognostic and predictive value of subtyping with regard to adjuvant therapy outcomes are conflicting, with \nsome studies suggesting no significant independent association between histologic subtype and adjuvant therapy response or overall or \ndisease-free survival (DFS).11-16\n• Although immunohistochemistry may be helpful in aiding the determination of histologic subtype, it is not required, as there may be \noverlap in the immunohistochemical profiles of intestinal and pancreatobiliary-type adenocarcinomas,8,17,18 which may make current \nimmunohistochemical panels unreliable for definitive determination of subtype.\nAMP-D\n4 OF 6PATHOLOGIC ANALYSIS: SPECIMEN ORIENTATION, HISTOLOGIC SECTIONS, AND REPORTING\nReferences on AMP-D 6 of 6PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

This could include neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for localized, potentially \nresectable disease, and first-line or subsequent therapy for locally advanced, metastatic, and recurrent disease.\n• Systemic therapy type may depend on the histologic subtype of ampullary cancer: intestinal versus pancreatobiliary or mixed.\n• For full systemic therapy options for intestinal type ampullary cancer, please review the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer  as related to \nadjuvant systemic therapy and therapy for metastatic disease. Where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended, the same regimens for \nadvanced/metastatic disease may be used. \n• For full systemic therapy options for pancreatobiliary type and mixed histology type ampullary cancer, please review the NCCN Guidelines \nfor Hepatocellular Carcinoma, NCCN Guidelines for Biliary Tract Cancers , and NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, as related \nto adjuvant systemic therapy and therapy for metastatic disease. Where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended, the same regimens \nused for advanced/metastatic disease may be used. \n• Goals of systemic therapy should be discussed with patients prior to initiation of therapy, and enrollment in a clinical trial is strongly \nencouraged.\n• Close follow-up of patients undergoing chemotherapy is indicated.\n• For regimens where RT or chemoradiation is included, see Principles of Radiation Therapy (AMP-F)  for more details related to radiation \ndelivery, including recommended technique and dose.\n• To optimize the care of older adults, see the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology .\n• An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines.PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY\nReferences on AMP-E 7 of 9Neoadjuvant Therapy (Localized Disease)\n• There is limited evidence to recommend neoadjuvant regimens for ampullary cancers, and most localized ampullary cancers are treated \nwith surgery first.1\n• If recommended, neoadjuvant regimens vary with regard to the use of chemotherapy and/or radiation. When considering neoadjuvant \ntherapy, consultation at a high-volume center is preferred. Participation in a clinical trial, if available, is encouraged.\nPancreatobiliary and Mixed Type Intestinal Type\n• Fluorouracil (5-FU) + leucovorin + irinotecan + oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX)a,2 or \nmodified FOLFIRINOXa ± subsequent chemoradiationb,c\n• Gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel ± subsequent chemoradiationb,c,d \n• Gemcitabine + capecitabine ± subsequent chemoradiationb,c\n• Gemcitabine + cisplatin ± subsequent chemoradiationb,c• Capecitabine + oxaliplatin (CapeOx) ± subsequent \nchemoradiationb,c\n• 5-FU + leucovorin + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)3 ± subsequent \nchemoradiationb,c\n• FOLFIRINOXa ± subsequent chemoradiationb,c\na FOLFIRINOX or modified FOLFIRINOX should be limited to those with ECOG 0–1.\nb Chemoradiation (AMP-E 6 of 9) .\nc If considering chemoradiation due to positive margins, chemotherapy should be given prior to the administration of chemoradiation.\nd Gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel is reasonable for patients with ECOG 0–2.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

Radiation can also be used to palliate pain and bleeding or relieve obstructive symptoms in patients \nwho have progressed or recurred locally.

Placement of fiducial markers directly into the \ntumor and/or periphery under EUS is preferred. Stents can assist with targeting; however, they can shift and are therefore less reliable than \nfiducials. In the adjuvant setting, strategically placed surgical clips may serve a similar purpose.\n• Position patient supine with arms up in an immobilization device that will be custom-made for each patient. The simulation scan range \nshould include the target structures and OARs. \n• Unless there is a contraindication to IV contrast, CT simulation with 2–3 mm slices should be performed with IV contrast whenever feasible \n(assuming adequate kidney function). Multiphase IV contrast delivery is preferred whenever possible to facilitate disease delineation, where \nclinically appropriate. MRI imaging may be complimentary to CT in target delineation. Neutral oral contrast may also be utilized.\n• Simulation and treatment of patient with nothing by mouth (NPO) may facilitate setup reproducibility. If the patient receives oral contrast, \nconsider giving the same volume of water prior to treatment each day to mimic simulation anatomy.\nMotion Management1:\n• A motion management strategy should be considered. \n• Respiratory motion should be accounted for in determining the internal target volume (ITV). These strategies may include using a four-\ndimensional computed tomography (4D-CT) scan, respiratory gating, breath-hold, respiratory tracking, or abdominal compression.\nPlanning, Dose, and Fractionation :\n• 3D-CRT, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), and stereotactic body RT (SBRT) can result in improved planning target volume (PTV) coverage \nwith decreased dose to OARs.2,3 IMRT is preferred over 3D-CRT for conventional or hypofractionated RT, particularly if dose escalation is \nbeing considered. The exact planning strategy used should be individualized to patient anatomy, clinical scenario, treatment goals, and dose \ngoals.\n• It is imperative to evaluate the dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the target structures and the critical OARs such as the duodenum, stomach, \nliver, kidneys, spinal cord, and bowel. See Table 1. Normal Tissue Dose Volume Recommendations for Chemoradiation Utilizing Conventional \nFractionation ( AMP-F 5 of 6). No definitive dose constraints for SBRT currently exist; however , they are emerging and are dependent on a \nvariety of factors including dose per fraction and total dose.\n• While these examples of limits are empirical they differ based on dose per fraction, total dose delivered, and disease status (adjuvant vs. \nunresectable). \nReferences on AMP-F 6 of 6PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

Therefore, the following \nrecommendations are given as examples of commonly used regimens. However, other recommendations based on similar principles are acceptable. \nb Adjuvant options listed apply only to patients who did not receive prior neoadjuvant therapy . For those who received prior neoadjuvant therapy, the adjuvant therapy \noptions are dependent on the response to neoadjuvant therapy and other clinical considerations.Localized Disease: \n• Data are limited to support specific treatment options for \nlocalized ampullary cancer; most data supporting the role of \nRT in this setting are in the adjuvant setting. \n• Neoadjuvant therapy may facilitate margin-negative resection \nin more advanced cases and may improve OS, but ideally \nshould be conducted as a clinical trial ( Principles of Systemic \nTherapy [AMP-E]).\n• The optimal timing for surgical resection following \nneoadjuvant RT has not been firmly established.\n• RT Dosing/Planning: \n\u0017For chemoradiation, the following RT doses have been \nreported: 45–54 Gy in 1.8–2.0 Gy fractions (in 25–30 total \nfractions) (doses higher than 54 Gy may be considered in a \nclinical trial).\n\u0017Elective nodal irradiation (ENI) is usually recommended for \nlocalized/locally advanced disease.\nNeoadjuvant/Adjuvantb,4:\n• After resection, patients often receive adjuvant RT for one or \nmore features that portend high risk for local recurrence (eg, \n≥T3, positive nodes, positive margins, poor differentiation, \nperineural/perivascular invasion). \n• If no prior neoadjuvant therapy and no evidence of recurrence \nor metastatic disease after resection, RT is included in the \nfollowing adjuvant therapy option:\n\u0017Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation ± \nsubsequent chemotherapy (Principles of Systemic Therapy \n[AMP-E]).Neoadjuvant/Adjuvant (continued)b,4:\n• RT Dosing/Planning: \n\u0017For chemoradiation, RT dose generally consists of 45–50.4 Gy in \n1.8–2.0 Gy fractions (in 25–28 total fractions) to the tumor bed, surgical \nanastomoses (hepaticojejunostomy and gastrojejunostomy may be \nomitted if clinically appropriate), and adjacent lymph node basins, with \npotential dose escalation to the high-risk regions, if clinically appropriate. \nCareful attention to the bowel and stomach dose is warranted and normal \ntissue dose constraints should always be considered. \n\u0017Several pancreatic clinical trials (RTOG) now refer to atlases to assist \nwith contouring and adjuvant RT planning: ( https://www.nrgoncology.org/\nAbout-Us/Center-for-Innovation-in-Radiation-Oncology ). Target design is \nsimilar in ampullary cancers.\n\u0017Preoperative CT scans and strategically placed surgical clips may be \nused to determine the tumor bed, ideally with the surgeon’s assistance.\nLocally Advanced:\n• Albeit rare, the goal of RT is to prevent or delay local progression (that may \nresult in pain or local obstructive symptoms) and facilitate local disease \ncontrol, and in some instances help facilitate R0 resection in patients \nconsidered for surgery.\n• Data are limited to support specific RT recommendations for locally \nadvanced disease. Options may include:\n\u0017Chemoradiation if not a candidate for combination chemotherapy.\n\u0017Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation in select patients \n(locally advanced without systemic metastases).\n• RT Dosing/Planning:\n\u0017For chemoradiation, RT dose generally consists of 45–56 Gy in 1.8–2.2 Gy \nfractions (in 25–30 total fractions). \nReferences on AMP-F 6 of 6PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

SBRT should be avoided if direct \ninvasion of the bowel or stomach is observed on CT, MRI, and/or endoscopy.Recurrent Ampullary Cancer (resection bed):\n• Data are limited to support specific RT recommendations for locally \nrecurrent ampullary cancer; the options for patients with recurrent, \nunresectable disease may include:\n\u0017Chemoradiation5 in selected patients who are not candidates for \ninduction chemotherapy.\n\u0017Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation or SBRT \n(Principles of Systemic Therapy [AMP-E]).\n• RT Dosing/Planning:\n\u0017For chemoradiation, RT dose generally consists of 45–56 Gy in \n1.8–2.2 Gy fractions (in 25–30 total fractions). \n\u0017There are limited data to support a specific RT dosing for SBRTc; \ntherefore, for recurrent ampullary cancer, it should be used as part \nof a clinical trial or at an experienced, high-volume center. \n\u0017However, caution is warranted when using higher doses and \nnormal tissue constraints must be respected. This approach is \noptimally performed in the setting of a clinical trial.\nReferences on AMP-F 6 of 6PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

See Principles of Palliation and Supportive Care (AMP-G) . \n\u0017Non-Metastatic Disease: Palliative RT can be considered for patients who are older and/or not candidates for definitive therapy due to poor \nPS or comorbidities.\n\u0017Metastatic Disease:\n ◊Metastatic sites causing pain (ie, osseous) may be palliated with a short course of RT. SBRT may be used in select cases for metastatic \nsites, including oligometastatic disease.\n ◊RT is reasonable for patients with metastatic disease who require local palliation for symptoms such as obstruction, pain refractory to \nanalgesic therapy, or bleeding.\n• RT Dosing/Planning:\n\u0017Palliative RT is commonly used, although specific dose and fractionation recommendations should take into account burden of metastatic \ndisease, normal tissue tolerance, and expected survival. \nAMP-F\n5 OF 6d Adapted from RTOG 1102 (IMRT, 2.2–54 Gy).\ne Adapted from RTOG 0848 (3D or IMRT).Table 1: Normal Tissue Dose Volume Recommendations for Chemoradiation Utilizing Conventional Fractionation\nOrgans at Risk \n(OARs)Neoadjuvant/Definitive/Palliative and \nRecurrent Recommendationsd Adjuvant Recommendationse\nKidney \n(right and left)Not more than 30% of the total volume \ncan receive ≥18 Gy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-2 Overview  \nAmpullary cancers are defined as tumors originating from the ampulla of \nVater  (formed by 3 anatomical components: the ampulla, the \nintraduodenal portion of the bile duct , and the intraduodenal portion of the \npancreatic duct ), while periampullary cancers may arise from locations \nencompassing the head of the pancreas, distal bile duct, duodenum, or \nampulla of Vater.1,2 Although relatively rare, accounting for only 0.2% of \ngastrointestinal malignancies and 6% of all periampullary cancers, \nampullary adenocarcinoma is an important entity given the pathologic \nvariations and associated prognosis.3 The 5 -year overall survival (OS) for \nampullary cancer is between 35 % and 50%; however, prognosis can vary \ngreatly based on a variety of factors such as patient age, TNM (tumor, \nnode, metastasis) classification, differentiation grade, and treatment \nmodality received.4-16 For example, the 5 -year OS for AJCC 7th Edition \nstage I, stage II, and stage III + IV ampullary cancer s is 64%, 27%, and \n17%, respectively.11 Similar to other malignancies, distant metastatic \ndisease bodes a particularly poor prognosis for ampullary cancer.4,7 \nRegardless, ampullary tumors generally have a more favorable outcome \nwhen compared to other periampullary malignancies.1,6,10 -12,17 -26 In a \nsingle -institutional review of 2564 periampullary cancers, the median \nsurvival for ampullary cancer was 47 months compared to 19, 23, and 54 \nmonths for pancreatic, biliary, and duodenal cancer, respectively.17 Early \ndetection might partially contribute to this prognostic pattern.  \nThe ampulla of Vater is an anatomically complex region, and distinction of \nperiampullary tumors based on site of origin is particularly challenging, \nespecially for large tumors that have invaded surrounding organs at \npresentation.27,28 The ampulla of Vater is comprise d of two mucosal tissue \ntypes: pancreatobiliary ductal mucosa and intestinal mucosa. Therefore, \nampullary cancer can be divided into two histologic subtype s: \npancreatobiliary subtype and intestinal subtype, a classification system \ninitially developed by Kimura et al.29 The proportion of each subtype varies widely between study populations.3,23,27,30 -33 CDX2 and MUC1 are useful \nbiomarkers to distinguish the two subtypes (pancreatobiliary subtype: \nCDX2 negative, MUC1 positive; intestinal subtype: CDX2 positive, MUC1 \nnegative) and have been shown to be independent prognostic factors in \nmultiple studies.30-33 Other biomarkers that have been proven useful in \nmaking this distinction are MUC2 and CK20.32-34 The utility of these \nbiomarkers, however, is limited by staining method ( hematoxylin and eosin \n[H&E] vs. immunohistochemistry [ IHC]), staining positivity threshold, and \nsubjective pathologists’ assessment. It should be noted that a significant \nproportion of ampullary adenocarcinomas may be of mixed phenotype.34,35 \nThus, the NCCN Panel recommends reporting of histologic subtypes as \npancreatobiliary, intestinal, or mixed, with the predominant pattern noted in \nthe pathology report for the mixed subtype (See Pathologic Analysis: \nSpecimen Orientation, Histologic Sections, and Reporting  in the \nalgorithm). It has been postulated for all periampullary cancers that \nhistologic subtype is at least as important of a prognostic factor as tissue \nof origin.3,23 Each ampullary cancer subtype seems to resemble  its \nperiampullary counterpart in terms of biological behavior and prognosis, \nwith the pancreatobiliary subtype demonstrating higher lymph node \ninvolvement and worse survival than the intestinal subtype.16,23,27,29 -31,35 -37 \nIn a retrospective study of 95 ampullary cancers and 206 matching \nperiampullary cancers, the OS of pancreatobiliary subtype was \ncomparable to that of pancreatic cancer (25 vs . 14 months; P = .123), but \nworse than that for intestinal subtype (25 vs . 98 months; P < .001).36  \nSystemic therapy is used in all stages of ampullary cancer. This includes \nneoadjuvant therapy for resectable or borderline resectable disease  (albeit \nused more rarely compared to pancreatic cancer) , adjuvant therapy, and \nfirst-line or subsequent -line therapy for locally advanced, metastatic, and \nrecurrent disease. Data for systemic therapy in ampullary cancer are very \nlimited; the only phase III randomized trial to date that enrolled a relatively \nlarge number of patients with ampullary cancer was ESPAC -3, which PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-3 tested 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) + leucovorin versus gemcitabine in the \nadjuvant setting.38 Thus, the NCCN recommendations for systemic \ntherapy options in ampullary cancer are frequently extrapolated from data \nin the setting of pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and biliary tract \ncancer, as well as panel members’ clinical experience. Often , systemic \ntherapy recommendations for pancreatobiliary/mixed type are derived from \npancreatic  or biliary tract  cancer, while those for intestinal type are derived \nfrom colorectal cancer  (See  NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer  and \nNCCN Guidelines for Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma ). Many regimens are \nput forth as likely options; however, their potential utility in individual \npatients must be carefully evaluated by the treating physicians based on \ninterpretation of original trial data and drug risk/benefit profile (See \nPrinciples of Systemic Therapy  in the algorithm).  \nRadiation therapy (RT) is another treatment modality that can be utilized  in  \nlocalized  ampullary cancer, sometimes in combination with chemotherapy , \nbut there is no high level evidence to support its utility .39-42 The goal of RT \nis to sterilize vessel margins, enhance the likelihood of a margin -negative \nresection, and/or provide adequate local control to prevent or delay \nprogression or prevent local disease recurrence while minimizing the risk \nof RT exposure to sur rounding organs at risk (See Principles of Radiation \nTherapy  in the algorithm). Last ly, palliation and supportive care are \nwarranted to prevent and ameliorate suffering while ensuring optimal \nquality of life for patients with end -stage disease who have run  out of \noptions (See Principles of Palliation and Supportive Care  in the algorithm). \nFor both of these modalities, recommendations are derived from the \nNCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma, which can serve as an additional source of \nreference. Briefly, opioids with or without neurolysis  or endoscopic \nultrasound (EUS) -guided celiac plexus neurolysis  can be utilized for pain \nmanagement in ampullary cancer . Palliative RT  with or without \nchemotherapy  or high -intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can also be utilized for severe pain refractory to analgesic therapy , although the \nrecommendation for HIFU is only supported by a small number of \nobservational studies.43 \nLiterature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update \nMethodology  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Head and \nNeck Cancers, an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain key literature in H&N cancers published since the \nprevious Guidelines update, using the following sear ch term: ampullary \ncancer. The PubMed database was chosen because it remains the most \nwidely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer -reviewed \nbiomedical literature.  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial ; Guideline; Meta -Analysis; Randomized Controlled Trial; \nSystematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key PubMed \narticles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to \nthese guidelines as discussed by the panel during the Guidelines update \nhave been included in this version of the Discussion section. \nRecommendations for wh ich high -level evidence is lacking are based on \nthe panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person -first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist , and anti -weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN \nGuidelines incorporate non -gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan -specific recommendations.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-4 and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women , female , and male  when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not diffe rentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent , the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nGenetics of Ampullary Cancer  \nAt the genomic level, important similarities and differences between \nampullary cancer and other periampullary cancers  exist. For example, the \nfrequency of KRAS  mutation s seems to be comparable between ampullary \ncancer44,45 and duodenal cancer,46,47 but much lower in either cancer than \nin pancreatic cancer (~30 % to 40% vs . ~90%48). KRAS  mutation s have \nbeen suggested to be predictive of outcomes in ampullary cancer; \nhowever, their prognostic value over histologic subtype is \nquestionable.44,45,49 The distribution of KRAS  mutation s across ampullary \ncancer subtypes is also unclear, as present studies include very small \nnumbers of patients , but they appear more frequent in pancreatobiliary \nsubtype s.50-52  \nOther somatic alterations that have been reported in ampullary cancer \ninclude mutations in APC, TP53 , CDKN2A , DPC4 , ELF3 , PIK3CA , and \nSMAD4 , HER2  amplifications, and microsatellite instability (MSI).51,53 -60 \nPathogenic mutations reported include BRCA1/2 , ATM , RAD50 , and \nMUTYH .57,61 A recent genomic classification study using  a large data set \nof 3411 patients with periampullary cancers found high concordance \nbetween histologic ampullary cancer subtypes and their respective genomic categories. Specifically, the pancreatobiliary  subtype \ncorresponds to pancreatic adenocarcinoma genomic signature, which is \ncharacterized by a high incidence of KRAS  mutations. The intestinal \nsubtype corresponds to colorectal adenocarcinoma genomic signature, \nwhich is characterized by mutations in APC and PI3KCA , high er tumor \nmutational burden (TMB), and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency \n(dMMR). However, there was significant genomic heterogeneity within \neach histologic subtype.52  \nThere are many  targeted agents currently approved by the U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration ( FDA) for a variety of cancers or that are under \nclinical development and testing. Future investigations into the genomic \nlandscape of ampullary cancer might have great implication in the \nselection of appropriate candidates for targeted therapy.  \nClinical Presentation and Workup  \nThe workup for patients presenting with clinical suspicion of ampullary \nneoplasm consists of pancreatic protocol CT (abdomen and pelvis – See \nPrinciples of Diagnosis, Imaging, and Staging  in the algorithm), followed \nby esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with or without EUS with biopsy \nand colonoscopy (if not previously performed according to established \nguidelines). The workup for p atients diagnosed with  noninvasive ampullary \nneoplasms, with or without high -grade dysplasia , should be similar to \nthose  with periampullary duodenal adenomas . \nEndoscopic biopsies of ampullary adenocarcinoma have shown poor \ndiagnostic accuracy, with high false -negative rates reported in the \nliterature (~20 % to 40%). The presence of adenocarcinoma within an \nadenoma can be missed by endoscopic biopsies, as adenocarcinoma foci \nhave been reported in the final pathologic analysis of what was initially \ndiagnosed as ampullary adenomas.62-69 63,65 -67,70 -72 EUS and CT are \ncommonly used  imaging techniques in the initial diagnosis and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-5 subsequent staging of ampullary neoplasms, with EUS noted as the more \nspecific and sensitive modality in several small, single -institution , \nprospective studies.63,70,72 -82  \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \nPatients presenting with ampullary adenocarcinoma should receive further \nworkup consisting of chest CT, pancreas protocol CT of abdomen/pelvis, \nliver function test s, and detection of baseline CA 19 -9 and \ncarcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA). Endoscopic retrograde \ncholangiopancreatography ( ERCP )/percutaneous transhepatic \ncholangiography (PTC) can be considered as clinically indicated.  The \nNCCN Guidelines for Ampullary Adenocarcinoma  derive their  pancreatic \ncancer radiology reporting template from the NCCN Guidelines for \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma . \nERCP/PTC has been used frequently in  the further evaluation of ampullary \nneoplasms and can provide additional diagnostic capability, albeit with \nincreased morbidity and even mortality, beyond what EGD/EUS and CT \ncan offer.63,67,68,72,76,83 An elevated CA 19 -9 level may be indicative of \nampullary adenocarcinoma, although normal levels have been reported in \n37% of patients.22,84 \nGenetic testing for inherited mutations can be considered, with the same \nrecommendations as those found in the NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic \nAdenocarcinoma . Specifically, genetic testing for inherited mutations is \nrecommended for any patient with confirmed ampullary cancer, using \ncomprehensive gene panels for hereditary cancer syndromes. Genetic \ncounseling is recommended for patients who test positive for a pathogenic \nmutation ( ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2,  CDKN2A, MLH1, MSH2 , MSH6, PALB2, \nPMS2, STK11, and TP53 ) or for patients with a positive family history of \ncancer, especially pancreatic/ampullary cancer, regardless of mutation \nstatus (See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic ). Multidisciplinary consultation is also \nwarranted, with the same considerations as those  found  in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma . Specifically, multidisciplinary \nreview should consider involving expertise from diagnostic imaging, \ninterventional endoscopy, medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgery, \npathology, geriatric medicine, genetic counseling, and palliative care (see \nPrinciples of Palliation and Supportive Care  in the algorithm). Consultation \nwith a registered dietitian should be considered (See NCCN Guidelines for \nOlder Adult Oncology  and NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care ).  \nFollowing the workup above, patients with no metastatic disease should \nreceive MRI to evaluate  indeterminate liver lesions as clinically indicated. \nPET/CT may be used when MRI cannot be performed (eg , pacemaker -\ndependent patient) . Histologic subtyping of the tumor as pancreatobiliary, \nintestinal, or mixed should also be carried out, if possible. Patients with \nmetastatic disease should receive biopsy confirmation, preferably from a \nmetastatic site. Core biopsy is recommended, if poss ible, to obtain \nadequate tissue for molecular  testing .  \nMolecular profiling of tumor tissue should be performed  with the same \nconsiderations as those found in the NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic \nAdenocarcinoma . Specifically, tumor/somatic molecular profiling is \nrecommended for patients with locally advanced/metastatic disease who \nare candidates for anti -cancer therapy to identify uncommon mutations. \nSpecifically testing for potentially actionable somatic findings including, but \nnot limited to fusions ( ie, ALK, NRG1, NTRK, ROS1, FGFR2, RET ), \nmutations ( ie, BRAF, BRCA1/2, KRAS, PALB2 ), amplifications  (HER2 ), \nMSI, dMMR , or TMB via an FDA -approved and/or validated next -\ngeneration  sequencing -based assay  is recommende d. Testing on tumor \ntissue is preferred; however, circulating  tumor DNA testing can be \nconsidered if tumor tissue testing is not feasible.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-6 Treatment of Ampullary Adenoma  \nAmpullary adenomas are benign tumors that can arise sporadically or in \nthe setting of hereditary polyposis syndromes such as familial \nadenomatous polyposis. Ampullary adenomas can undergo malignant \ntransformation and result in ampullary adenocarcinomas; however, the \nexact course and rate of transf ormation are still unclear.85-87   \nPatients presenting with ampullary adenoma can be treated with \nendoscopic  removal  (preferred) , surgical ampullectomy, or \npancreatoduodenectomy (See Principles of Surgical Technique  in the \nalgorithm). Patients  with negative margins following endoscopic removal \nor surgical ampullectomy should undergo endoscopic surveillance, \nwhereas after pancreatoduodenectomy, patients do not need to undergo \nsurveillance. Patients  with positive margins after endoscopic removal can \nbe re -excised or undergo ampullectomy or pancreatoduodenectomy. \nPatients  with positive margins after ampullectomy can undergo \npancreatodu odenectomy.  \nSince foci of occult adenocarcinoma have been found in ampullary \nadenoma, and the exact timeline and rate of malignant transformation \nfrom adenoma to adenocarcinoma is not known, there is some debate \nregarding the optimal management of these lesions. A few  studies have \nattempted to put forth criteria for endoscopic removal of benign ampullary \nneoplasms.88,89 The NCCN Panel recommends that ampullary adenomas \nup to 20 mm in diameter be safely removed endoscopically, including \nthose with high -grade dysplasia. Depending on the size and extent of \ninvasion, ampullary adenomas might require multiple rounds of resection \nand more than one surgical t echnique for complete removal.72,90,91 All \nthree techniques —endoscopic resection,62-64 surgical ampullectomy,65,69,92 \nand pancreaticoduodenectomy —65,69,84 have been shown to be effective in \nremoving ampullary adenomas in retrospective, heterogeneous studies. In \nparticular, endoscopic resection, also interchangeably referred to as endoscopic papillectomy or endoscopic ampullectomy in the literature, has \nbeen shown to be effective and safe in patients with ampullary adenomas. \nThe reported recurrence rates are between 6% and 40% with varying \nlengths of follow -up; most recurrences are successfully resected \nendoscopically.64,72,89,93 -97 Commonly reported complications include \nhemorrhage, perforation, and pancreatitis.72,93,94,96,98 Endoscopic resection \nis the NCCN -preferred treatment modality for ampullary adenomas. The \nNCCN Panel recommends endoscopic removal of ampullary adenomas to \nbe performed at a high -volume center.  \nStudies directly comparing the three resection techniques are scant and of \nretrospective nature.90,91,98 A study (n = 137) comparing all three \nmodalities with surveillance found that endoscopic resection was \nassociated with higher residual and recurrent tumor rates than \npancreatoduodenectomy (27.6% vs . 0% and 17.2% vs . 0%, respectively) \nbut fewer adverse events  (AEs)  (10.2% vs . 29%). This study contained too \nfew surgical ampullectomies (n = 4) to be able to draw  any meaningful \nconclusion s regarding this modality.98 Another study directly comparing \nendoscopic resection and surgical ampullectomy (n = 109) reported no \ndifference in mortality, margin positivity, and reoperation between the two \nprocedures. Endoscopic resection, however, was associated with \nsignificantly lower morbidity (18% vs . 42%; P = .006) and readmission \nrates (16% vs . 34%; P = .03).91 Overall, endoscopic resection seems to \nlead to more recurrences, but is generally safer than surgical procedures. \nIn a study including 180 patients with ampullary adenomas, endoscopic \nresection was associated with a greater risk of recurrence than operati ve \nresection (32% vs . 3%; P = .006) but a lower rate of complication (58% vs . \n29%; P < .001).90 A meta -analysis , which includes five studies and a total \nof 466 patients with ampullary adenomas concurred that surgical \ntreatment had lower recurrence rate (risk difference [RD] , 0.10; 95% CI , –\n0.01 to 0.19) than endoscopic resection; however, no difference in \ncomplication rates was found (RD , –0.15; 95% CI , –0.53 to 0.23).99  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-7 Treatment of Ampullary Adenocarcinoma  \nTreatment of Localized Disease  \nThe first line of treatment for localized ampullary adenocarcinoma usually \ninvolves surgery, primarily pancreatoduodenectomy . Specimens are \nobtained at this point for pathologic analysis to determine the pathologic \nstage of the tumor, completeness of resection, and other histopathologic \nfeatures that impact prognosis and clinical management. Decisions about \ndiagnostic management  and resectability should involve multidisciplinary \nconsultation at a high -volume center with reference to appropriate high -\nquality  imaging studies to evaluate the extent of disease (See Principles of \nSurgical Technique  and Pathologic Analysis: Specimen Orientation, \nHistologic Sections, and Reporting  in the algorithm). Biliary s tent \nplacement is not routinely recommended prior to planned surgery; \nhowever, a stent may be considered for symptoms of cholangitis/fever or \nsevere symptomatic jaundice (intense pruritus), or if surgery is being \ndelayed for any reason, including neoadjuva nt therapy (See Principles of \nStent Management  in the alg orithm).  \nNeoadjuvant systemic therapy can be considered, particularly in patients \nat high risk, with or without subsequent chemoradiation. High -risk features \ninclude imaging findings, markedly elevated CA 19 -9, markedly elevated \nCEA, large primary tumors, large regional lymph nodes, excessive weight \nloss, and extreme pain. There is limited evid ence to recommend specific \nneoadjuvant regimens off -study, and practices vary with regard to the use \nof chemotherapy and chemoradiation. After neoadjuvant therapy and stent \nplacement, pancreatic protocol CT or MRI is recommended, followed by \nsurgery in case of resectable disease. Unresectable disease should be \nmanaged with the same systemic therapy regimens  as metastatic disease.  \nAll resected ampullary cancers can receive postoperative adjuvant \ntreatment. The initiation of adjuvant systemic therapy is recommended \nwithin 12 weeks of surgery if the patient is medically fit. The optimal duration of treatment is 4 to 6 months. The NCCN recommendations for \neach disease stage are  as follows : 1) stage I disease , systemic therapy or \nobservation ; 2) stage II disease , systemic therapy with or without \nchemoradiation or observation ; and 3) stage III disease , systemic therapy \nwith or without che moradiation.  \nAfter adjuvant therapy, patients should undergo surveillance every 3  to 6 \nmonths for 2 years, then every 6  to 12 months for up to 5 years or as \nclinically indicated . During surveillance, history and physical examination \nshould take place, as should chest CT and CT or MRI of the abdomen and \npelvis with contrast. CEA and/or CA 19 -9 levels should also be measured.  \nSurgical Techniques  \nPancreatoduodenectomy is the primary surgical technique for the removal \nof primary ampullary adenocarcinoma with reported postoperative 5 -year \nsurvival of 32 % to 78%.6-8,10,13,19,24,25,100 -102 The reported morbidity and \nmortality for this procedure are 27 % to 59% and 2 % to 10%, respectively.6-\n9,12-15,69,73,84,100 -102 It should be noted that most studies are small, \nretrospective, contain heterogenous populations , and combine results for \nbenign and malignant ampullary neoplasms or combine results for \nampullary cancers and other periampullary cancers. Reported p rognostic \nfactors for survival and recurrence outcomes include lymphovascular \ninvasion, perineural invasion, tumor size and stage, ulceration, \ndifferentiation, presence and extent of lymph node metastasis,  resection \nmargin status,  as well as CEA and CA  19-9 levels.6,7,10,13,15,22,84,101,103 -105 \nHowever, data vary widely across studies on each of these parameters. \nFor example, perineural invasion is not always documented on  the \npathology report and thus is not included in many analyses. Many studies \nthat include d perineural invasion, however, found that it has a significant \nimpact on recurrence and/or survival, at least on univariate analyses if not \nmultivariate analyses.6,12,22,84,104,106,107 Bettschart et al (n = 70) reported a \nmedian survival of 18.7 vs . 51.9 months for cancers  with and without PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-8 perineural invasion, respectively ( P = .001).12 Regarding 5 -year survival, \nSong et al (n = 89) reported rates of 36.8% versus  72.1% in those with \nand without perineural invasion, respectively ( P < .001).107 CEA and CA \n19-9 levels are two other features that have not been consistently \nmeasured and documented for ampullary cancer. Studies have reported \nan inverse  association between CA 19 -9 level and \nrecurrence/survival,13,108,109 an association for CEA but not CA 19 -9,103 an \nassociation for CA 19 -9 on univariate but not multivariate analyses,22 or no \nassociation between either marker with recurrence and/or survival .104 \nTherefore, the prognostic utility of these markers remains controversial.  \nThe impact of histologic subtype on surgical outcome is, perhaps, even \nmore understudied. According to Park et al (n = 93), among patients who \ndeveloped early recurrence ( defined as within 6 months of surgery; \ndisease -free survival [DFS] = 4.2 months), the pancreatobiliary subtype \nrecur red early compared to the intestinal subtype (71.4% vs . 28.6% early \nrecurrences; P = .001 ); however, this might be due to more advanced T \nstage and lymph node metastases in the pancreatobiliary subtype.106 A \nmultivariate analysis from this study also showed that pancreatobiliary \nsubtype  was associated with very early recurrence following surgery. Bolm \net al reported median OS after pancreatoduodenectomy to be 118 months \nversus  156 months for pancreatobiliary /mixed subtype versus  intestinal \nsubtype, respectively, with statistical significan ce on univariate ( P = .003) \nbut not multivariate analysis.108 Evidence thus far is not definitive on \nwhether histologic subtypes are independent prognostic factors for \noutcomes.  \nStudies have reported lymph node positivity  in 30 % to 67% of patients with \nampullary adenocarcinomas undergoing \npancreatoduodenectomy.7,9,10,13,14,22,69,70,84,104,107,108,110 -112 For optimal \nstaging, a minimum of 17 lymph nodes in pancreatoduodenectomy \nspecimens is recommended.113-115 As mentioned earlier, the presence and extent of lymph node involvement is predictive of outcome in ampullary \ncancer. Except for the results from two small single -institution studies , \neach including fewer  than 100 patients,100,101 it was uniformly \ndemonstrated that survival was significantly better for node -negative \nversus node -positive  disease.7-9,13,14,69,70,84,104,107,108,111 In particular, a large \npopulation -based study that included 1301 patients who underwent \nresection for ampullary cancer reported significantly higher  5- and 10 -year \ndisease -specific survival (DSS) for node -negative versus  node -positive \ndisease (59.4% vs . 28.4%; P < .001 and 54.1% vs . 21.9%; P < .001, \nrespectively).9 Furthermore, increased number of positive lymph nodes \ndiminishes survival, as the cumulative 5 -year survival rates were reported \nin a small study (n = 34) to be 85% with 0 positive node, 63% with 1 to 3 \npositive nodes, and 0% for ≥4 positive nodes ( P < .0001).112 Factors such \nas tumor size, histologic grade, perineural invasion, microscopic vessel \ninvasion, depth of invasion, and morphology have been associated with \nlymph node invasion.84,107 In particular, one study (n = 450) noted that the \nrisk of lymph node invasion  increased with T stage (T1, 28.0%; T2, 50.9%; \nT3, 71.7%; T4, 77.3%;  P < .001).84 Another study (n = 259) reported \nsimilar results, with lymph node positivity  rates at 11.3%, 28.4%, 43.8%, \nand 100% for T1, T2, T3, and T4 tumors, respectively.110 \nThere are very few studies directly comparing pancreatoduodenectomy \nand surgical ampullectomy. One larger study (n = 450, \npancreatoduodenectomy = 435, ampullectomy = 15), which did not \nseparate results for ampullary adenomas and ampullary \nadenocarcinomas, reported no statistical difference in morbidity (52.2% vs . \n33.3%) or mortality (2.1% vs . 0%) between the two procedures.84 The \nnumber of ampullectomies in this study, however, was too small to make \nany meaningful conclusion. A more recent, albeit smaller, study (63 \npancreatoduodenectomies, 26 ampullectomies) demonstrated that \npancreatoduodenectomy led to more postoperative co mplications, \nspecifically significantly higher mean blood loss, longer operative time, and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

It was \nnoted that patients treated with pancreatoduodenectomy in this study \ntended to present more frequently with jaundice, gross morphology, and \nlarge tumor size. There was no difference in 5 -year OS (65.6% vs . 64.6%) , \nbut pancreatoduodenectomy resulted in longer DFS (median ~85 vs . 40 \nmonths —estimated from Kaplan -Meier curves; P = .025).107 Overall and \nas expected, ampullectomy seems to result in lower morbidity and \nmortality, but is associated with a higher recurrence rate.69,70 A few studies \nhave attempted to establish standard indications for ampullectomy  in \npatients with ampullary cancer ; however, the  specific criteria remain to be \ndetermined.80,116 \nRecently, laparoscopic and robotic pancreatoduodenectom ies have  \nbecome more widespread due to their potential for quicker recovery and \nshorter hospital stays; however, how they compare  to open \npancreatoduodenectomy remains a question under investigation.25,102,117 -\n120 \nPostoperatively , the rates of recurrence and time to recurrence vary widely \nacross studies. Recurrences have been reported as early as less than 6 \nmonths and as late as 22.5 months after surgery.7,22,103,106,110,121 The rates \nof recurrence range between 28 % and 55%, with distant recurrences \nmaking up the majority or about 80% in many studies. For distant \nrecurrences, the most common site of metastasis is the liver (38 %–65% of \ndistant recurrences). Other sites of metastasis are the peritoneum, lung, \nand bones. Overall, the liver is the most common site of all recurrences, \nlocoregional or distant.7,22,103,106,110,121 One study noted that while \npancreatic invasion and tumor size were predictive of locoregional \nrecurrence, lymph node involvement  was the sole predictor for liver \nmetastasis.7 More data are needed to better characterize distant metastases in ampullary cancer and understand the implications such \nfindings might have on treatment decisions.  \nNeoadjuvant Therapy  \nVery few studies have investigated the use of neoadjuvant therapy in \nampullary cancer. Overall, the use of neoadjuvant therapy is low, varying \nbetween 1 % and 4% of patients undergoing surgery across studies.122,123 \nIn the biggest and most recent study on this topic with a total of 8688  \npatients with  ampullary cancer, 175 of whom received neoadjuvant \ntherapy, no difference in OS was found between the neoadjuvant and the \nsurgery -first groups (43 vs . 33 months, respectively; P = .401 on univariate \nand .416 on multivariate analysis). It was noted in this study that patients \nwho received neoadjuvant therapy tend to be younger and more likely to \nhave nodal metastas es.122 This result was recapitulated by two other \nstudies, one that included 3762 patients, 94 of whom received \nneoadjuvant therapy, and another smaller study with 142 patients, 43 of \nwhom received neoadjuvant therapy.123,124 Despite little proven advantage \nin improving survival, neoadjuvant therapy led to downstaging (15 %–67% \nof tumors across studies) and was associated with decreased use of \nadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation.123-125 These studies emphasize \nthe need for careful selection of patients who might benefit from \nneoadjuvant therapy.  \nThe NCCN -recommended neoadjuvant therapy options for \npancreatobiliary/mixed  type ampullary cancer include \nFOLFIRINOX/modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX), gemcitabine + \ncisplatin, gemcitabine + capecitabine, and gemcitabine + albumin -bound \npaclitaxel. The NCCN -recommended neoadjuvant therapy options for \nintestinal type ampullary cancer include FOLFOXIRI, FOLFOX, and \ncapecitabine + oxaliplatin (CapeOx). All of these regimens can be \npotentially followed by chemoradiation  based on multidisciplinary tumor \nboard re commendation .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-10 For pancreatobiliary/mixed type ampullary cancer, the recommendations \nfor FOLFIRINOX/mFOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine + cisplatin, and \ngemcitabine + albumin -bound paclitaxel are derived from the NCCN \nGuidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma  and NCCN Guidelines for  \nBiliary Tract Cancers , with the addition of gemcitabine + capecitabine \nbased on panel members’ clinical experience. It should be noted that there \nare no prospective randomized phase III data supporting these \nrecommendations. The  available evidence is derived from prospective \nphase II or randomized phase II studies as well as from  retrospective \nstudies .126-131 For more information on these studies, see the discussion \nsection s of the NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma  and the \nNCCN Guidelines for Biliary Tract Cancers .  \nFor intestinal type ampullary cancer, all three recommendations are \nderived from the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer  and the NCCN \nGuidelines for Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma . These recommendations are \nbased on high -level evidence, phase III randomized data from the \nneoadjuvant  FOxTROT trial (FOLFOX, CapeOx)  in localized colon \ncancer ,132 data from the TRIBE and TRIBE2 trials (FOLFOXIRI)  for \nmetastatic disease , and data from one phase II study with neoadjuvant \nFOLFOXIRI for localized colon cancer .133-135 For more information on \nthese studies, see the discussion section of the NCCN Guidelines for \nColon Cancer . \nAdjuvant Therapy  \nAdjuvant therapy is frequently utilized after curative resection in ampullary \ncancer, most often in the form of chemotherapy. R adiotherapy  can also be \nused in the adjuvant setting, often  in combination with chemotherapy.111 \nMost of the literature on adjuvant therapy in ampullary cancer is \nretrospective in nature. In a recent large analysis of National Cancer \nDatabase ( NCDB ) data (n = 4190), both adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 880) \nand adjuvant chemoradiation (n = 670) were found to be associated with improved OS compared to observation (n = 2640). In the first analysis, \nmedian OS for the adjuvant chemotherapy group and the observation \ngroup were 47.2 and 35.5 months, respectivel y (hazard ratio [ HR], 0.82; P \n< .01 ). In the second analysis, median OS for the adjuvant chemoradiation \ngroup and the observation group were 38.1 months and 31.0 months, \nrespectively  (HR, 0.84; P = .02 ). Patients who are  at high risk, such as \nthose with higher T - and N -stage disease, seemed to benefit more from \nboth adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemoradiation.136 Two large \nmeta -analyses, one that included 71 studies and 8280 patients,16 and the \nother that included 10 studies and 3361 patients,137 together with many \nsmaller retrospective studies agree with the benefit of adjuvant therapy, \nwhether chemotherapy, radiotherapy , or chemoradiation for resected \nampullary cancers.108-110,125,138 -140 Some studies have also documented the \nusefulness of adjuvant therapy specifically for patients with lymph node \ninvolvement.111,139,140 Narang et al (n = 186) demonstrated that, for patients \nwho were node positive , adjuvant chemoradiation compared to \nobservation led to longer OS (median OS , 32.1 vs . 15.7 months; 5 -year \nOS, 27.5% vs . 5.9%; HR, 0.47; P = .004). In this study, adjuvant therapy \nwas more likely used for higher T -stage, lymph node involvement, and \nclose or positive margins.111 Kamarajah et al (n = 1106) showed the \nbenefit of adjuvant radiotherapy  for N2 disease in improving both DSS  \n(median , 27 vs . 19 months; P = .0044) and OS (median , 23 vs . 17 months; \nP = .0091).139 An interesting finding was reported by Bolm et al (n = 214), \nin which adjuvant therapy (gemcitabine, gemcitabine + oxaliplatin, \ncapecitabine, FOLFOX, chemoradiation, or unknown  regimen ) was \nbeneficial for the pancreatobiliary subtype (improved median OS , 85 vs . \n65 months for observation; P = .005) but not the intestinal subtype.108 \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, chemotherapy should be given prior to the \nadministration of chemoradiation , if chemoradiation is being considered \ndue to positive or close margins.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-11 Despite many positive reports on the benefit of adjuvant therapy, there \nexists an equal amount of literature demonstrating no effect of adjuvant \ntherapy on recurrence and survival outcomes. 6,7,14,22,84,101,141 -148 It was \nshown in almost all of these studies that adjuvant therapy was more \ncommonly used in patients with more advanced disease (poorly \ndifferentiated, higher T/N stage). In a recent retrospective study by Kang \net al (n = 475), no benefit was noted with adjuvant 5 -FU + leucovorin -\nbased chemotherapy  over observation in terms of both OS or recurrence -\nfree survival (RFS), even after stratification by TNM stage. However, there \nseemed to be a particular benefit of this regimen versus  observation for \nthe intesti nal subtype (5 -year OS , 83.7% vs . 33.2% ; P = .015 ; and RFS \n46.5% vs . 24.9%; P = .035) , but no t for the  pancreatobiliary/mixed type.144 \nWinter et al reported no benefit of adjuvant chemoradiation (5 -FU plus \n50.4 Gy) versus observation overall , but found a slight improvement in \nsurvival for patients with cancers with perineural invasion (30.4 vs . 12.5 \nmonths; P = .08).84  \nThe NCCN -recommended adjuvant therapy options for \npancreatobiliary/mixed type ampullary cancer are gemcitabine (category \n1), 5-FU + leucovorin (category 1), gemcitabine + capecitabine, \ngemcitabine + cisplatin, FOLFOX/CapeOx, capecitabine, and \nmFOLFIRINOX. Based on the same data, the NCCN -recommended \nadjuvant therapy options for intestinal type ampullary cancer include 5 -FU \n+ leucovorin (category 1), FOLFOX/CapeOx, and capecitabine.  \nThe recommendations for 5 -FU + leucovorin and gemcitabine are based \non results of the ESPAC -3 trial.38 In this phase III, randomized, open -label \ntrial, patients with ampullary, bile duct, or other periampullary cancers \nwere randomized to 5 -FU + leucovorin, gemcitabine, or observation; a \ntotal of 297 patients with ampullary cancer were randomized ; 100, 92, and \n105 patients in each arm, respectively. The median survival for each arm \nwas 57.8, 70.8, and 40.6 months, respectively. Statistical comparisons between treatment arms were not reported for individual cancer types. \nWhen data for all 3 cancer types were combined, there was no significant \ndifference in survival between treatment arms, but the HR for \nchemotherapy compared to observation was significant ( P = .03). The \nauthors mentioned that there was no significant difference in survival \nbetween the pancreatobiliary subtype and the intestinal subtype in \nresponse to treatment; however, these data were not reported. The rate of \ntreatment -related serious AEs w as higher in those receiving 5 -FU + \nleucovorin than in those receiving gemcitabine (49% vs . 30%; P = .00 2). \nBased on the high level of evidence presented in this study, the NCCN \nPanel assigned a category 1 designation to gemcitabine and 5 -FU + \nleucovorin for the adjuvant treatment of resected ampullary cancers. \nGemcitabine is also used in the adjuvant settin g in pancreatic cancer, \nbased on data from CONKO -001.149 \nThe recommendation for gemcitabine + capecitabine is based on \nextrapolation of data from ESPAC -4.150 ESPAC -4 was a phase III, \nrandomized, open -label trial that tested gemcitabine monotherapy or \ngemcitabine in combination with capecitabine for the adjuvant treatment of \nresected pancreatic cancer. A total of 730 patients were included in the \nfinal analysis , 366 in the gemcitabine arm and 364 in the gemcitabine + \ncapecitabine arm. The median OS was 25.5 months and 28 months in the \ngemcitabine and gemcitabine + capecitabine arm, respectively ( P = .032). \nWhile 54% of patients in the monotherapy group experienc ed any grade \n3–4 AEs, this rate was 63% in the combination arm.  \nThe recommendation for gemcitabine + cisplatin is extrapolated from data \nof a phase II randomized trial that enrolled 410 patients with advanced \nbiliary tract cancer.151 Ampullary cancers were included, but the exact \nnumber was not reported. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic \ndisease were randomly assigned to receive either gemcitabine + cisplatin \n(n = 204) or gemcitabine alone (n = 206).

The \nrates of any grade 3 –4 AEs were similar between the 2 arms (70.7% vs . \n68.8% for combination and single agent, respectively). Gemcitabine + \ncisplatin was not tested in the adjuvant setting in this trial , but other \nsmall er trials tested adjuvant gemcitabine + cisplatin after surgery  for \nbiliary cancers.152,153 \nThe recommendation for CapeOx is extrapolated from data of a phase II \ntrial that enrolled a total of 31 patients  with advanced small bowel and \nampullary cancers , 12 of whom had ampullary cancer.154 All patients had \nmetastatic or unresectable tumors and no prior systemic chemotherapy. \nEveryone received CapeOx. The overall response rate was 50%, and the \nmedian OS was 20.4 months. The NCCN Panel deems FOLFOX a \nreasonable alternative to CapeOx based on clinical experience with these \nagents in periampullary cancers. CapeOx was not tested in the adjuvant \nsetting in this trial.  In addition, the recommendation of FOLFOX/CapeOx \nadjuvant therapy for intestinal type ampullary cancers is also derive d from \nadjuva nt FOLFOX/CapeOx chemotherapy trials in colon cancer .155,156 \nThe recommendation for capecitabine is based on extrapolation of data \nfrom BILCAP, a phase III randomized trial that enrolled 447 patients with \nbiliary tract cancer (cholangiocarcinoma or muscle -invasive gallbladder \ncancer).157 In this study, patients were randomly assigned to capecitabine \n(n = 223) or observation (n = 224) after surgery . After a median follow -up \nof 60 months, t he median OS was statistically similar between the two \narms (51.1 vs. 36.4 months in the capecitabine vs . observation groups, \nrespectively; P = .097). Serious AEs were observed in 21% of patients in \nthe capecitabine group and 10% of patients in the observation group.  In \naddition, the recommendation for capecitabine adjuvant therapy for intestinal type ampu llary cancers is derive d from the X -ACT study in colon \ncancer.158 \nThe recommendation for mFOLFIRINOX is based on extrapolation of data \nfrom the PRODIGE 24/CCTG PA.6 phase III randomized trial  in resected \npancreatic cancer .159 In this study, 493 patients with pancreatic cancer \nwere randomly assigned to receive mFOLFIRINOX (n = 247) or \ngemcitabine (n = 246) postoperatively. The median PFS and median OS \nwere significantly longer in the mFOLFIRINOX group compared to the \ngemcitabin e group (21.6 vs . 12.8 months; P < .001 ; and 54.4 vs . 35.0 \nmonths;  P = .003, respectively). The rate of grade 3 –4 AEs was higher in \nthe mFOLFIRINOX group (75.9% vs . 52.9%).  \nChemoradiation  \nThe NCCN recommendations for chemoradiation in ampullary cancer are \nsimilar to those in the NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma , \nNCCN Guidelines for Biliary Tract Cancers  for pancreatobiliary ampullary \ncancers, and NCCN Guidelines for Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma  for \nintestinal type ampullary cancers . The preferred options for \npancreatobiliary, mixed, and intestinal types are capecitabine + concurrent \nRT and 5 -FU + concurrent RT, while gemcitabine + concurrent RT is \nrecommended for pancreatobiliary type only. All three regimens have been \nreported in the  literature, mostly in the adjuvant setting; however, these \nstudies are usually small, retrospective, single -institutional , and \nheterogenous.16,109,111,125,136,137,140,148 The most commonly used \nchemoradiation regimen in these studies is 5 -FU–based. In a large \nanalysis of data from the NCDB , in which 870 patients received adjuvant \nchemotherapy and 669 patients received adjuvant chemoradiation, it was \nobserved that adjuvant chemotherapy use increased (9% –32% between \n2004 –2005 and 2012 –2013) during the same time that adjuvant \nchemoradiation use decreased (20% –12% during the same time \nperiod).136 As described in the previous section on adjuvant therapy, the PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-13 literature is split regarding the usefulness of adjuvant chemoradiation in \npatients with ampullary cancer.16,109,111,125,136,137,140,148 A systematic review \nand meta -analysis of large databases  was conducted using 10 \nretrospective studies including 3361 patients with ampullary cancer . \nAdjuvant RT was delivered with concurrent chemotherapy, mostly 5 -FU, in \nall institutional studies.  The results demonstrated that a djuvant \nchemoradiation significantly reduced  the risk of death (HR , 0.75; P = \n.01).137 Several studies are  in agreement that adjuvant chemoradiation \nseems to particularly benefit patients who are node  positive, as mentioned \nin the previous section on adjuvant therapy.111,137,140 A phase III, \nrandomized EORTC trial tested adjuvant chemoradiation with 5 -FU versus \nobservation alone after surgery  in patients with pancreatic head and \nperiampullary cancers. Of the 103 patients assigned to the observation \narm, 57 had pancreatic cancer, 44 had periampullary cancer, and 2 were  \nunknown; of the 104 patients assigned to the treatment arm, 55 had \npancreatic cancer, 48 had periampullary cancer, and 1 was unknown. \nHowever, it was not specified how many patients had ampullary cancer in \nthis study . Regardless, the final results were not in favor of \nchemoradiation, showing no significant difference in median duration \nsurvival or 2 -year survival rates between the two arms.160 There is more \nhigh-level evidence on chemoradiation in the setting of pancreatic cancer, \nsuch as data from ESPAC -1, which can be extrapolated to ampullary \ncancer.161 For more information on these studies, see the discussion \nsection of the NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma . \nTreatment of Metastatic Disease  \nPatients diagnosed with metastatic ampullary adenocarcinomas should \nreceive genetic testing for hereditary  mutations and molecular profiling of \ntumor tissue, if not previously done. Those with good performance status \n(PS; defined as ECOG 0 –1 with good biliary drainage and adequate \nnutritional intake) can receive systemic therapy . Chemoradiation may be \nused  for palliative indications. For select patients with oligometastatic disease and response/stable disease to systemic therapy, local -directed \ntherapy to liver or lung metastases may be considered  after review in a \nmultidisciplinary tumor board . Patients with poor PS should receive \npalliative and best supportive care and be considered for systemic \nchemo therapy, targeted therapy based on molecular profiling as clinically \nindicated, or for palliative RT (See Principles of Radiation Therapy  and \nPrinciples of Palliation and Supportive Care  in the algorithm). For specific \nsystemic therapy regimen recommendations, see Principles of Systemic \nTherapy  in the algorithm.  \nFirst -Line Systemic Therapy  \nFor pancreatobiliary/mixed type ampullary cancer with good PS, the \nrecommendations for FOLFIRINOX/mFOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine + \nalbumin -bound paclitaxel, gemcitabine + cisplatin,  gemcitabine + cisplatin \n+ durvalumab , and gemcitabine + capecitabine are derived from the \nNCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma  and the NCCN \nGuidelines for Biliary Tract Cancers , with the addition of FOLFOX based \non panel members’ clinical experience. Most of these recommendations \nare based on phase II/ III randomized data \n(FOLFIRINOX/mFOLFIRINOX,162,163 gemcitabine + albumin -bound \npaclitaxel,164 gemcitabine + cisplatin,151 gemcitabine + cisplatin + \ndurvalumab ,165 and gemcitabine + capecitabine166). For more information \non these studies, see the discussion section of the NCCN Guidelines for \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  and NCCN Guidelines for Biliary Tract \nCancers . For pancreatobiliary/mixed type ampullary cancer with poor PS, \nsimplified formulations of the same regimens for patients with good PS are  \nrecommended, with the goal of reducing toxicity. While gemcitabine, \ncapecitabine, and 5-FU + leucovorin  are appropriate for these patients, \nthose with ECOG PS 2 can receive multi -agent regimens such as \nFOLFOX or gemcitabine + albumin -bound paclitaxel.

These patients can additionally \nreceive 5 -FU ± bevacizumab and capecitabine ± bevacizumab.171,172 For \nmore information on these studies, see the discussion section of the \nNCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer .  \nDue to the controversial role of anti -EGFR therapies in KRAS  wild-type \nsmall bowel cancers or for right -sided colon cancers, the panel members \ndo not recommend using anti -EGFR therapies for KRAS  wild-type \nampullary adenocarcinomas of intestinal subtype. Data with anti -EGFR –\ntargeted therapies in ampullary adenocarcinomas are scant . Due to no \ndata with tipiracil/tipifarnib ± bevacizumab  or with regorafenib in small \nbowel cancers or intestinal subtype ampullary carcinomas, these agents \nare not recommended . \nIn addition to chemotherapy recommendations, pembrolizumab is a \nrecommended option for all ampullary tumors with MSI -high (MSI -H), \ndMMR, or high TMB (TMB -H) (≥10 mut/Mb ), and nivolumab + ipilimumab \nis a recommended option for MSI -H, dMMR  intestinal type ampullary \ncancer s. Patients can also receive larotrectinib or entrectinib if the tumors \ntest positive  for NTRK  gene fusion . These options are applicable \nregardless of PS. With the exception of nivolumab + ipilimumab, the \nrationale for which comes from the metastatic colorectal cancer setting, \nthe other four regimens are supported by basket trials that included many different cancer types. No ampullary cancer and a very small number of \nperiampullary cancers w ere included in these studies. Th erefore, cautious \nextrapolation of data from these studies to the ampullary cancer setting is \nprudent.  \nThe recommendation for pembrolizumab is supported by data from the \nphase II KEYNOTE -518 study, in which a total of 233 patients \nrepresenting 27 tumor types were treated with pembrolizumab after failure \nwith prior therapy.173 The objective response rate was 34.3%, median PFS \nwas 4.1 months , and median OS was 23.5 months. The rate of grade 3 –5 \ntreatment -related AEs was 14.6%. No patient with ampullary cancer was \nenrolled, although the trial included 24 patients with gastric cancer, 22 \npatients with cholangiocarcinoma, 22 patients with pancreatic cancer, and \n19 patients with cancer of the small  intestine.  \nThe recommendation for nivolumab + ipilimumab is based on data in the \nmetastatic colorectal cancer setting, hence its suitability only for intestinal \ntype ampullary cancer.174 In the phase II CheckMate 142 study, patients \nwith no prior treatment received nivolumab + ipilimumab until disease \nprogression. The objective response rate was 69% , while 2 -year PFS and \n2-year OS were 74% and 79%, respectively. The rate of grade 3 –4 \ntreatment -related AEs was 22%. This trial also included a cohort of \npreviously treated patients. In this group (n = 119), the objective response \nrate was 55% and the 1 -year PFS and 1 -year OS were 71% and 85%, \nrespectively.  The rate of grade 3 –4 treatment -related AEs was 32%.175 \nThe recommendations for larotrectinib and entrectinib are supported by \ndata from two phase I –II basket trials.176,177 The first enrolled 55 patients, \nincluding 4 with colon cancer, 2 with cholangiocarcinoma, and 1 with \npancreatic cancer, who were treated with larotrectinib. The overall \nresponse rate was 75% , and neither the median duration of response nor \nthe median PFS was reached after a median follow -up of 9.9 months.176 \nThe second basket trial enrolled 54 patients, including 4 with colorectal PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.

This recommendation is based \non data from 2 clinical trials.178,179 NCI-MATCH Subprotocol H  was an \nopen -label study that evaluated dabrafenib + trametinib in patients with \nsolid tumors, lymphomas, or multiple myeloma whose tumors harbored a \nBRAF  V600E mutation. Overall, t he response rate was 37.9% (n = 29), \nwith a median duration of response of 25.1 months. With a median follow -\nup of 23 months, median OS was 28.6 months; median PFS was 11.4 \nmonths.178 ROAR was a phase II, open -label basket trial in patients with \nBRAF  V600E -mutated rare cancers. In 43 patients with BRAF  V600E -\nmutated biliary tract cancer, the response rate s by investigator and \nindependent reviewer assessment were 51% and 47%, respectively. \nMedian OS was 14 months and median PFS was 9 months.179 \nTreatment for Disease Progression  \nPatients with disease progression and good PS should preferably be \nenrolled in clinical trials. Alternative options are systemic chemo therapy, or \npossibly targeted therapy based on molecular profiling as clinically \nindicated, or palliative RT for severe pain refractory to analgesic therapy. \nThe second line of treatment includes palliative and best supportive care \nor clinical trial enroll ment. Patients with disease progression and poor PS \nshould receive palliative and best supportive care and be considered f or \nsystemic therapy, targeted therapy based on molecular profiling as \nclinically indicated, or palliative RT (See Principles of Radiation Therapy  \nand Principles of Palliation and Supportive Care  in the algorithm). For \nspecific systemic therapy regimen recommendations, see Principles of Systemic Therapy  in the algorithm. For anyone receiving therapy for \ndisease progression, serial imaging is recommended as indicated to \nassess disease response.  \nThe recommendation for selpercatinib is supported by data from a phase \nI/II basket trial in RET fusion -positive solid tumors other than lung and \nthyroid tumors (LIBRETTO -001).180 Among 41 patients with solid tumors, \nincluding pancreatic, biliary tract, and colorectal cancers, the overall \nresponse rate was 43.9% and the median duration of response was 24.5 \nmonths. The median PFS was 13.2 months. Among 11 patients with \npancreatic ca ncer, the response rate was 54.5% and the median duration \nof response was not reached. The FDA approved selpercatinib as a \ntreatment option for locally advanced or metastatic RET fusion -positive \nsolid tumors.  \nSubsequent -Line Systemic Therapy  \nFor subsequent therapy for disease progression, the rule of thumb is that \nany regimen other than the one used in the first -line setting is a possible \noption. In patients with good PS and pancreatobiliary/mixed type \nampullary cancer previously treated with a gemcitabine -based regimen, a \nfluoropyrimidine -based regimen is recommended for subsequent -line \ntherapy. FOLFIRINOX181 or mFOLFIRINOX and FOLFOX182-186 can be \nused, as well as modifications to these regimens including 5 -FU + \nleucovorin + liposomal irinotecan,187-189 FOLFIRI,190-193 OFF,149,182,194,195 \nCapeOx,196 capecitabine,197 and 5 -FU + leucovorin.149,187,195 Vice versa, in \npatients with good PS and pancreatobiliary/mixed type ampullary cancer \npreviously treated with a fluoropyrimidine -based regimen, a gemcitabine -\nbased regimen is recommended for subsequent -line therapy. Gemcitabine \n+ albumin -bound paclitaxel and gemcitabine + capecitabine can be used, \nas well as modifications to these regimens including gemcitabine. In \naddition , FOLFIRI190,191 or 5-FU + leucovorin + liposomal irinotecan187 can \nbe tried in case of no progression on prior irinotecan.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAmpullary Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-16 PS and pancreatobiliary/mixed type ampullary cancer, gemcitabine,197 \ncapecitabine,197 or 5-FU + leucovorin149,187,195 can be used for disease \nprogression, depending on the first -line regimen used. For patients with \nECOG PS 2, multi -agent regimens such as FOLFOX and gemcitabine + \nalbumin -bound paclitaxel are options, as well as CapeOx and FOLFIRI \nbased on panel members’ clinical experience.  \nIn addition to these agents, gemcitabine + cisplatin for known \nBRCA1/2 /PALB2  mutations is recommended for patients with good PS in \nthe subsequent -line setting. This recommendation is supported by data \nfrom a phase II randomized trial where 50 patients with previously \nuntreated pancreatic cancer with germline BRCA/PALB2  mutations were \nrandomly assigned to gemcitabine + cisplatin or gemcitabine + cisplatin + \nveliparib. The response rate was 74.1% and 65.2% for each arm, \nrespectively; median PFS was 10.1 month s and 9.7 months, and median \nOS was 15.5 months and 16.4 months, respectively.198  \nSimilar to recommendations for the first -line setting, all of the \nrecommendations for the subsequent -line setting are derived from phase \nII/III data in pancreatic cancer  or biliary cancer , with the exception of the \nreference for FOLFIRINOX, which is an exploratory analysis of the \nMPACT trial.181 For more information on these studies, see the discussion \nsection s of the NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma  and \nNCCN Guidelines for Biliary Tract Cancers . \nFor patients with good PS and intestinal  type ampullary cancer, FOLFIRI ± \nbevacizumab is a possible subsequent -line option for patients previously \ntreated with an oxaliplatin -based regimen. FOLFOX ± bevacizumab,168,169 \nor CapeOx ± bevacizumab168 can be used for patients previously treated \nwith an irinotecan -based regimen. For patients with poor PS and intestinal  \ntype ampullary cancer, the same recommendations as those in the first -\nline setting apply (5 -FU + leucovorin;199 for those with ECOG PS 2: \ncapecitabine ± bevacizumab, 5 -FU ± bevacizumab,200 FOLFOX ± bevacizumab, FOLFIRI ± bevacizumab,201 and CapeOx ± bevacizumab ). \nSimilar to recommendations for the first -line setting, all of the \nrecommendations for the subsequent -line setting are derived from phase \nII/III data in colon cancer. For more information on these studies, see the \ndiscussion section of the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer . \nTargeted therapy regimens recommended in the first -line setting are also \npossible options in the second -line setting: pembrolizumab, nivolumab + \nipilimumab, larotrectinib, entrectinib , selpercatinib,  and dabrafenib + \ntrametinib . As explained in the previous section, trials demonstrating the \nefficacy of these regimens included all or a portion of patients who had \nreceived and progressed on prior systemic therapy.173,175 -180 \nFurthermore, dostarlimab -gxly is recommended for good and poor PS in \ntumors with MSI -H or dMMR. This recommendation is based on results of \na phase I basket study where a total of 209 patients, including 99 with \ngastrointestinal cancer (69 with colorectal cancer) who received \ndostarlimab -gxly until disease progression or discontinuation. The \nobjective response rate was 41.6%.202 \nHER2 overexpression occurs in 13% of ampullary cancers, and HER2 \ntargeting is relevant.  HER2 -targeted therapy is included in  the NCCN \nGuidelines for Biliary Tract Cancers  (applies to pancreatobiliary subtype) . \nThe FDA also recently approved tucatinib + trastuzumab for pretreated \ncolorectal cancer.  In the MY PATHWAY basket trial , among 114 patients,  \ntrastuzumab + pertuzumab conferred an overall response rate of 26% , \nand responses occurred in  pancreatic  (22%) , biliary (29%), and colorectal \n(38%) cancers with HER2 amplifications, supporting the use of this \ncombination in HER2 -amplified ampullary carcinomas.203,204 Of note, t he \nNCCN Panel currently does not recommend HER2 -targeted therapy as a \ntreatment option for ampullary adenocarcinoma.  \n  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:17:32 PM.
