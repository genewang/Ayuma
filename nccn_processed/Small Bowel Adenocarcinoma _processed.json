There should be either direct \ncommunication between the surgeon and pathologist for proper \norientation and margin identification, or the surgeon should \nidentify the important margins with a clearly understood and \ndocumented method (eg, written on the pathology requisition); see \nabove – Status of margins.\n\u0017Lymphovascular invasion\n\u0017MSI/MMR status\n\u0017Evidence of celiac disease\n\u0017Presence of Crohn’s disease\n\u0017Presence of polypsLymph Node Evaluation\n• The AJCC recommends a minimum evaluation of eight lymph nodes, \nalthough the College of American Pathologists notes no clear \nnumber of minimum lymph nodes to predict complete lymph node \nnegativity has been established \n• Regional lymph nodes differ by site of primary tumor:\n\u0017Duodenum: retropancreatic, hepatic artery, inferior \npancreaticoduodenal, and superior mesenteric\n\u0017Jejunum/ileum: cecal (terminal ileum only), ileocolic (terminal \nileum only), superior mesenteric, mesenteric, and NOS\nMicrosatellite Instability/Mismatch Repair Testing\n• Universal MMR or MSI testing is recommended in all newly \ndiagnosed patients with SBA\n• Incidence of deficient MMR (dMMR)/MSI-high (MSI-H) and the \npossibility of germline mutation is enriched in patients with SBA \ncompared to those with colon and rectal cancer, making this an \nimportant prognostic and/or predictive biomarker1,2\n• Patients with stage II dMMR/MSI-H may have improved survival \ncompared to patients with proficient MMR (pMMR)/microsatellite \nstable (MSS); however, this has not been confirmed in the SBA \npopulation and is extrapolated from colorectal cancer data\n• MMR or MSI testing should be performed only in Clinical Laboratory \nImprovement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratories\n• Testing for MSI may be performed by validated next-generation \nsequencing (NGS) panels\nFor more information on molecular testing for NTRK, BRAF, KRAS, \nPOLE/POLD1 , RET, HER2, etc., see the Principles of Pathologic and \nMolecular Review in the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer .\n1 Aparicio T, Svrcek M, Zaanan A, et al.

The dose of fluorouracil (2400 mg/m² over 46 hours) is a starting dose consistent with the dose \nrecommended in FOLFOX or FOLFIRI and should be strongly considered for U.S. patients.• FOLFOX\n\u0017mFOLFOX65-7\n ◊Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV day 1p\n ◊Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV day 1q\n ◊5-FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus on day 1, then 1200 mg/m2/day x 2 days \n(total 2400 mg/m2 over 46–48 hours) IV continuous infusion\n ◊Repeat every 2 weeks\n\u0017mFOLFOX76-8\n ◊Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV day 1p\n ◊Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV day 1q\n ◊5-FU 1200 mg/m2/day x 2 days  \n(total 2400 mg/m2 over 46–48 hours) IV continuous infusion\n ◊Repeat every 2 weeks  \n• FOLFOX + bevacizumab9,10\n\u0017Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV day 1s\n\u0017Repeat every 2 weeks\n• CAPEOX11\n\u0017Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 IV day 1p\n\u0017Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily PO for 14 daysr\n\u0017Repeat every 3 weeks  \n • CAPEOX + bevacizumab9,10,12\n\u0017Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 IV day 1p\n\u0017Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 PO twice daily for 14 daysr\n\u0017Bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg IV day 1s\n\u0017Repeat every 3 weeks  \n• FOLFIRI13\n\u0017Irinotecan 180 mg/m2 IV over 30–90 minutes, day 1\n\u0017Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV infusion to match duration of irinotecan \ninfusion, day 1q\n\u00175-FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus day 1, then 1200 mg/m2/day x 2 days  \n(total 2400 mg/m2 over 46–48 hours) continuous infusion\n\u0017Repeat every 2 weeks  \n• FOLFIRI + bevacizumab9,10\n\u0017Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV, day 1s\n\u0017Repeat every 2 weeks\n• FOLFIRINOX14,15,t\n\u0017Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m² IV day 1p\n\u0017Leucovorin 400 mg/m² IV over 2 hours on day 1\n\u0017Irinotecan 180 mg/m² IV over 30–90 minutes on day 1\n\u0017Fluorouracil 400 mg/m² IV push day 1, fluorouracil 1200 mg/m²/day \nx 2 days (total 2400 mg/m² over 46 hours) continuous infusion\n\u0017Repeat every 2 weeksAdditional Regimens (SBA-D 5 of 9)\nReferences on SBA-D 8 of 9PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:04:25 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nSmall Bowel Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-2 Overview  \nIn 202 4, an estimated 12,440 new cases of small bowel cancer will occur,  \nand 2090 patients will die of this disease.1 Compared to cancers of other \norgans in the gastrointestinal tract, small bowel cancers are relatively rare, \naccounting for only about 3% of cancers occurring in this organ system.  \nSmall bowel cancers affect m ales and females  relatively equally, with an \nincidence of 2.6 per 100,000 for males and 2.0 per 100,000 for females .2 \nThe median age at diagnosis is 66  years . The incidence of small bowel \ncancers is increasing, with an annual percent increase of 1.8 between 2006 and 2015.  This trend is in contrast to other gastrointestinal \nmalignancies, including esophageal, gastric, colon, and rect al, which \ndecreased in incidence across the same timeframe.\n2 The four most \ncommon cancer histologies originating in the small bowel are \nadenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST s), and lymphomas.\n3,4 The treatment recommendations in this \nguideline only refer to small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA) , which \ncomprise an estimated 30% to 40% incidence of small intestinal cancer \ndiagnoses .4 Due to the rarity of this disease, there are very few \nestablished guidelines for SBA management. In 2018, a French i ntergroup \npublished the first  clinical practice guidelines for SBA.5 These NCCN \nClinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Small \nBowel Adenocarcinoma  are the second.  \nThis Discussio n summarizes the NCCN Guidelines® for Small Bowel \nAdenocarcinoma . These guidelines begin with the clinical presentation of \nthe patient and address diagnosis, pathologic staging, surgical \nmanagement, perioperative treatment, patient surveillance, management \nof recurrent and metastatic disease, and survivorship. When rev iewing \nthese guidelines, clinicians should be aware of several things. First, these guidelines adhere to the TNM (tumor, node, metastases)  staging system \n(Table 1 in the algorithm).\n6 Furthermore, all recommendations are \nclassified as category 2A except where noted in the text or algorithm. Although the guidelines are believed to represent the optimal treatment strategy, participation in a clinical trial is especially encouraged for patients  \nwith SBA based on the dearth of clinical trial data on which to base \ntreatment decisions for this disease.  \nLiterature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update \nMethodology  \nPrior to the development  of the NCCN Guidelines for Small Bowel \nAdenocarcinoma , an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain key literature in the field of small bowel cancer , using \nthe following search terms: (small bowel  cancer ) OR (small intestine \ncancer) OR (jejunum  cancer)  OR (duodenum cancer) OR (ileum cancer) . \nThe PubMed database was chosen because it remains the most widely \nused resource for medical literature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical \nliterature.7 The search  results were narrowed by selecting studies in \nhumans published in English. Results were confined to the following article \ntypes:  Clinical Trial;  Multicenter Study; Practice Guideline;  Randomized \nControlled Trial ; Meta -Analysis ; Systematic Reviews ; and Validation \nStudies.   \nThe data from key PubMed articles and articles from additional sources \ndeemed as relevant to these Guidelines  and discussed by the Panel have \nbeen included in this version of the Discussion section  (eg, e- publications \nahead of print, meeting abstracts) . Recommendations for which high- level \nevidence is  lacking are based on the P anel’s review of lower -level \nevidence and expert opinion.  NCCN recommendations have been \ndeveloped to be inclusive of individuals of all sexual and gender identities \nto the greatest extent possible. When citing published studies  and \nrecommendations from other organizations, the terms used (eg, male , \nfemale)  reflect  the cited sources.  \nThe complete details of the D evelopment and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available on the NCCN website  at www.NCCN.org .

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nSmall Bowel Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-3 Sensitive/Inclusive Language Usage \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.8 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN \nGuidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male  when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not diffe rentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nRisk  Factors for Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma \nRisk factors for SBA  are similar to those for colorectal cancer  (CRC) , \nincluding lifestyle factors, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) , and certain \nfamilial syndromes  such as Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary \nnonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]), Peutz -Jeghers syndrome \n(PJS) , and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Therefore, it is \nrecommended that all patients with small bowel  cancer be queried \nregarding their family history and considered for risk assessment, as detailed in the NCCN Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer Screening.   Lifestyle Factors \nAlthough data on the role of lifestyle factors in relation to the risk of \ndevel oping SBA  are very limited due to low incidence of disease , lifestyle \nfactors that have been reported as raising the risk of SBA generally a gree \nwith known risk factors for CRC.  A systematic review of the literature has \nreported that high levels of alcohol consumption, smoking, and dietary \nfactors , including low intake of fiber and high intake of red/processed meat \nand sugary drinks , may increase the risk of SBA.9 Additionally, the results \nof a pooled analysis of more than 500,000 individuals in the Asia Cohort \nConsortium reported that elevated body  mass index (BMI) and high \nalcohol consumption were associated with a non- significant trend towards \nan increased risk of SBA , although this analysis did not identify smoking \nas a risk factor .10  \nInflammatory Bowel Disease and Celiac Disease \nIt is well recognized that individuals with IBD  (ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s \ndisease)  are at increased risk for CRC. Several studies have also reported \nan increased risk of distal SBA in patients with IBD .11-16 The results of a \nretrospective, multicenter observational cohort study of 9100 patients with IBD found that the relative risk of small bowel cancer was 3.70 (95% CI, 1.23– 11.13).The rate of death and cancer remission did not differ between \npatients who maintained treatment for IBD compared to those who \nstopped IBD treatment.\n11 Additionally,  in a cohort study  of 48,119 \nindividuals with celiacs disease (CD),  0.06%  (n = 29) patients were \ndiagnosed with SBA within 1 year of a CD diagnoses , suggesting a \npossible link between these conditions .17 The association with celiac \ndisease is poorly understood and a distinct difference from CRC, for which celiac disease is not a risk factor.  \nFamilial Syndromes  \nDue to the relative rarity of SBA, and the disease’s association with \nseveral genetic syndromes, the NCCN Panel recommends that all patients PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:04:25 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nSmall Bowel Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-4 with SBA should be counseled for familial malignancies and considered for \nrisk assessment of various genetic syndromes , including Lynch syndrom e, \nPJS, FAP, and other polypoid mutations. A brief description of some of these syndromes is included below . See the NCCN Guidelines for \nGenetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Colorectal, Endometrial, and \nGastric  for more information.  \nFamilial Adenomatous Polyposis  \nFAP is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by a germline mutation in the APC  gene, located on chromosome 5q21.\n18,19 Patients with \nFAP develop large numbers of adenomatous polyps in the large bowel, beginning as early as adolescence, and most patients with classic FAP will develop polyps by the age of 25. Patients with attenuated FAP due to a germline MUTYH  mutation develop fewer numbers of polyps, generally at \na later age than those with classic FAP.\n18,19 While the incidence of SBA in \npatients with FAP has not been well established, the lifetime risk has been estimated as 3% to 5%.\n20 The duodenum and periampullary region are the \nmost common locations for SBA in patients with FAP.20  \nPeutz -Jeghers Syndrome \nPJS is an autosomal dominant condition mainly characterized by multiple \nhamartomatous and adenomatous gastrointestinal polyps , predominantly \nlocated in the jejunum and ileum.20,21 A majority of PJS cases occur due to \nmutations in the STK11 (LKB1)  gene.22,23 However, other genetic \nmutations may be involved, as an estimated half of patients with PJS do \nnot have detectable STK11/LKB1  mutations.24 SBA can arise from either \nhamartomatous or adenomatous polyps, predisposing patients with PJS to \nSBA. The relative risk of developing SBA has been estimated as 520 compared to the general population,\n25 and the lifetime risk of SBA has \nbeen estimated between 1.7%  to 13% for individuals with PJS.20,25,26  Lynch S yndrome  \nLynch syndrome is a hereditary syndrome resulting from germline \nmutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes ( MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , \nand PMS2 ). Individuals with Lynch syndrome are estimated to have a \nlifetime risk of 4% of developing SBA, representing a relative risk of > 100 \ncompared to the general population.27,28 Although identifying a mutation in \nan MMR gene through germline sequencing is definitive for Lynch \nsyndrome, patients usually undergo selection for screening by considering family history and performing an initial test on tumor tissue before \nsequencing. One of two (or both)  different initial tests can be performed on \nSBA specimens to identify individuals who might have Lynch syndrome: 1) \nimmunohistochemical analysis for MMR protein expression, which is often \ndiminished because of mutation; or 2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) \nanalysis for microsatellite instability (MSI), which results from MMR \ndeficiency and is detected as changes in the length of repetitive DNA \nelements in tumor tissue caused by the insertion or deletion of repeated units .\n29  \nMany NCCN Member Institutions and other comprehensive cancer centers \nperform immunohistochemistry  (IHC) and sometimes MSI testing on all \nnewly diagnosed CRC and endometrial cancers regardless of family \nhistory to determine which patients should have genetic testing for Lynch syndrome.\n7,30-33  This approach may also be applied to patients with SBA , \nparticularly since it has been reported that SBA has a higher percenta ge of MSI-high ( MSI-H)/MMR -deficient ( dMMR ) tumors compared to CRC .\n34,35 \nThe NCCN Colon/Rectal /Anal  Cancer s Panel endorses universal MMR or \nMSI testing of all newly diagnosed patients with SBA to identify individuals \nwith Lynch syndrome. This testing is also relevant for treatment selection \nin stage IV disease (see Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab  ± Ipilimumab , or \nDostarlimab -gxly [for dMMR/MSI -H tumors] , below).

For \nGIST s, see the NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma ; for \nneuroendocrine tumors , see the NCCN Guidelines for Neuroendocrine \nand Adrenal Tumors ; and for small bowel lymphomas see the NCCN \nGuidelines for B -Cell Lymphomas . \nMost cases of SBA arise in the duodenum, accounting for approximately 52% to 58% of cases. The remainder arise in the jejunum ( 15%–29%), \nileum (10% –13%), or in an unspecified location of the small bowel (4% –\n16%).\n36-39 Patients with SBA tend to be younger at diagnosis and often \npresent with a higher stage and grade compared to those with CRC.40 \nSBA often presents with a local complication of the tumor , most often \ngastric outlet obstruction in the case of a duodenal SBA or cramping abdominal pain in the case of a jejunal or ileal SBA.\n36,41,42  Occult \ngastrointestinal bleeding is another common presentation for SBA, occurring in approximately one- quarter  to one-third of cases.  \nPatients who present with small bowel cancer require a complete staging \nworkup, including bi opsy  (if appropriate) , pathologic tissue review, imaging \nstudies (see Imaging and Endoscopy , below), complete blood count \n(CBC), chemistry profile, carbohydrate antigen 19- 9 (CA 19- 9), \ncarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) , and MMR or MSI testing. In addition, \npatients with metastatic and/or recurrent disease should also be tested for \nBRAF  V600E mutation and HER2 amplification. Testing for tumor \nmutational burden (TMB) and POLE/POLD 1 mutation  should be \nconsidered for these patients . Depending on the tumor’s location and the \npatient’s history, studies for celiac disease or IBD may be indicated. As discussed above, MMR or MSI testing is recommended for all patients \nwith SBA as MMR/MSI status can f unction as a prognostic and/or \npredictive marker and can help identify patients who should be tested for Lynch syndrome (s ee Risk Factors for Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma, \nabove).  \nFor more information on molecular testing for NTRK , BRAF , \nPOLE/POLD1 , RET, HER2 amplifications,  and TMB, see the Principles of \nPathologic and Molecular Review in the NCCN Guidelines for Colon \nCancer . \nImaging  and Endoscopy  \nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy  (EGD) with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) \nis recommended during initial workup and staging for detection and \npathologic sampling when a duodenal malignancy is suspected. If \nobstruction is detected during imaging, palliative diversion or stenting may \nbe considered.43 EUS is useful  for pre-therapeutic staging of proximal \nsmall bowel malignancies and may be used to discern duodenal lesions from ampullary, biliary, or pancreatic primaries.\n44 \nOther endoscopic techniques that are not required for routine staging, but may be useful in certain circumstances, include double balloon endoscopy and capsule endoscopy.  A number of studies, both prospective and \nretrospective,  have reported on the effectiveness  and safety  of double \nballoon endoscopy for workup of patients with small bowel  cancer.\n45-47 \nSpecifically, the use of this method may be of particular benefit for patients with small bowel strictures.\n48 While capsule endoscopy allows for a more \ndetailed examination of the entire small bowel mucosa , possibly resulting \nin the diagnosis of SBA when other imaging methods have failed to reveal a primary lesion, it is not the preferred method for initial workup due to its \ninability to biopsy tissue for diagnosis.\n49-51 In the case of a small bowel \nobstruction or stricture, the capsule may not be excreted naturally, requiring surgical removal. Therefore, capsule endoscopy is \ncontraindicated for these conditions.\n43 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:04:25 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nSmall Bowel Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-6 CT or magnetic resonance (MR ) imaging  may be used during initial \nworkup of SBA to evaluate the extent of local tumor invasion and to \nassess for distant metastases. CT or MR enterography , techniques \ninvolving administration of enteric contrast agent to the gastrointestinal \nsystem  via oral intake or nasogastric tube, respectively , may improve \nimaging of the small bowel and, therefore, may be considered when \nconventional CT or MR  with contrast have failed to discern a tumor.52-55 A \nprospective study comparing CT enterography to MR enterography in 150 patients with suspected small bowel disease, but negative findings on \nendoscopy, reported that MR enterography was more accurate than CT \nenterography, particularly for neoplastic disea ses ( P = .0412) .\n56 \nWhile FDG -PET/CT has not been formally evaluated for ability to detect \nmetastatic SBA, or compared to MR or CT , there have been reports \ndescribing its usefulness for this disease.57 Therefore, while FDG -PET/CT \nis not routinely indicated, it may be considered when CT or MR  results are \nequivocal.  \nSee Posttreatment Surveillance, below, for  the use of these imaging \nmethods for posttreatment surveillance and for use in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or familial syndromes.  \nPathology and Staging \nSBA staging  is based on the TNM staging system.6 In the 8th edition of the \nAJCC Staging Manual,  T1 tumors involve the lamina propria or \nsubmucosa; T2 tumors penetrate through the submucosa into the muscularis propria; T3 tumors penetrate through the muscularis propria  \ninto the subserosa or extend into nonperitonealized perimuscular tissue; \nand T4 tumors perforate the visceral peritoneum or directly invade other \norgans or structures.  Regional lymph node classification includes N0 (no \nregional lymph node metastasis) , N1 (1 –2 positive lymph nodes), and N2 (3 or more positive nodes) . SBA is classified as M1  when distant \nmetastasi s is present.\n6 \nSBA is staged as I or II when a tumor is present without regional lymph \nnode or distant metastases (any T, N0, M0). Stage III disease includes disease with regional lymph node, but not distant, metastasis (any T, N1–2, M0). Stage IV is distant metastatic disease (any T, any N, M1).\n6 A \nnumber of sources have reported stage III or IV SBA as having significantly worse outcomes compared to earlier stage disease.\n6,58,59  \nOther factors that may be useful for prognostication, but not used for staging, include the primary tumor site (ie, duodenum, jejunum, ileum); \nhistologic grade; number of lymph nodes evaluated; margin status; \nlymphovascular invasion; MSI/MMR status; evidence/presence of celiac or \nIBD; and presence of polyps.\n6 The NCCN P anel recommends reporting of \nthese parameters  during pathologic review .    \nLymph Node Evaluation \nRegional lymph nodes differ based on the site of the primary tumors: \nretropancreatic, hepatic artery, inferior pancreaticoduodenal, and superior \nmesenteric nodes are regional to the duodenum; cecal or ileocolic (terminal ileum only, superior mesenteric, or mesenteric [not otherwise \nspecified] ) nodes are regional to the jejunum and ileum.   \nMultiple analyses of patients with SBA in the SEER database have found that longer survival following resection is strongly associated with a lower  \nratio of positive- to-negative lymph nodes as well as with a higher number \nof regional lymph nodes assessed during surgery.\n40,60 -62 Two of these \nanalyses, which considered duodenal and jejunoileal adenocarcinomas separately, concluded that, for adequate staging, a minimum of 5  lymph \nnodes should be retrieved for duodenal tumors and a minimum of 9 lymph \nnodes for jejunal or ileal tumors.\n61,62 Analyses that  pooled duodenal and \njejunoileal tumors found that 8 regional lymph nodes should be assessed PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:04:25 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nSmall Bowel Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-7 for adequate staging,40,60 although some data ha ve suggested that \nharvesting even higher numbers of lymph nodes may better predict SBA \nsurvival outcomes.63 Based on these studies, NCCN recommends that a \ngoal for all SBA resections should be the retrieval of at least 8  regional \nlymph nodes for evaluation.  \nTreatment of Stage I –III Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma \nSurgical Management of Localized Resectable Disease \nFor local (stage I –III) SBA, primary treatment consists of surgical resection \nwith en bloc removal of the regional lymph nodes. While there have been no prospective randomized trials to inform surgical technique, \nretrospective reviews on the subject have been published.\n64-67 \nIntraoperative staging of the abdomen—particularly including the \nmesentery, omentum, and peritoneum —should be completed in all cases.  \nThe type of resection used to treat localized SBA depends on the location \nof the primary tumor. Segmental resection of the small bowel is often the \nmainstay of treatment, although duodenal tumors may require either pancreaticoduodenectomy or segmental duodenal resection. For tumors of \nthe jejunum or ileum, segmentectomy is the preferred method of resection.  \nPancreaticoduodenectomy, also known as the Whipple procedure, should \nbe considered for all duodenal cancers, and is particularly  appropriate for  \nthose arising in the second portion of the duodenum or invading into any portion of the ampulla or pancreas. Minimally invasive procedures, such as laparoscopic surgery, may be considered for pancreaticoduodenectomy, but should only be used by experienced \nsurgeons. Limited segmentectomy may be considered in SBA involving the third and fourth segments of the duodenu m and on the anti -mesenteric \nside of the intestine, although this approach is controversial based on \nreports of lower lymph node yields.\n66 However, a retrospective study of \n1611 patients with duodenal adenocarcinoma found that patients who were treated with radical resection did not show an improvement in overall \nsurvival (OS) or disease -specific survival compared to a simple removal of \nthe primary site, after controlling for confounding factors.68 This finding \nwas despite greater lymph node retrieval with radical resection. Another systematic review and meta -analysis of observational studies including \n6438 patients with duodenal cancer also reported that both segmental resection and pancreaticoduodenectomy allowed adequate assessment of \nlymph nodes and no difference in OS was  observed between the two \ntechniques  with distal duodenal primary tumors .\n67 Limited resection may \nalso produce more favorable r ates of overall morbidity and postoperative \npancreatic fistula.69 Case reports have suggested that segmentectomy \nand other limited resection methods may be considered for lesions in the \nfirst portion of the duodenum, particularly for those < 2 cm in size and \nlocated on the mesenteric side of the intestine.65 \nNCCN recommends that a goal for all SBA resections should be the retrieval of at least 8  regional lymph nodes for evaluation based on the \nstrong prognostic impact of lymph node metastases and studies showing \nimproved outcomes with higher numbers of lymph nodes assessed during \nsurgery.\n60-62 See Lymph Node Evaluation , above, for more information on \npathologic review of dissected lymph nodes.  \nAdjuvant  Therapy  \nLocalized SBAs are treated with surgical resection, but local and distant \nrecurrences are common and optimal perioperative therapy is unknown.70 \nTherefore, participation in a clinical trial is preferred for all patients with SBA who are considering adjuvant therapy. For discussion of neoadjuvant therapy, see Primary Treatment of Unresectable Disease, below.  \nThe ongoing, international phase III BALLAD trial is the first prospective \ntrial investigating the role of adjuvant 5- FU/leucovorin (5- FU/LV) or 5-\nFU/LV plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) compared to observation alone for PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:04:25 PM.

The data from retrospective \nstudies  or meta -analyses  that have sought to assess the efficacy of \nadjuvant therapy (either chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) for SBA have been mixed, with some showing a benefit to adjuvant therapy,\n39,73 -75 \nsome showing no benefit,37,76,77  and some showing an equivocal  or non-\nsignificant benefit.78,79  \nThe IDEA collaboration was a large trial of patients with colon cancer that investigated whether limiting adjuvant treatment to 3 months of FOLFOX or CAPEOX—which would markedly decrease the incidence of neuropathy —would compromise oncologic outcomes.\n80,81 While the non-\ninferiority of 3 months versus 6 months of CAPEOX was not proven, 3 months of CAPEOX numerically appeared similar to 6 months of CAPEOX for 5- year OS (82.1% vs. 81.2%; HR, 0.96), with considerably less toxicity. \nThese results support the use of 3 months of adjuvant CAPEOX over 6 \nmonths for patients with stage III colon cancer. For stage II disease, the duration of therapy was associated with a small (and not statistically significant) difference in disease -free survival ( DFS) between 3 and 6 \nmonths of CAPEOX.\n82 There were significantly less grade 3– 5 toxicities \nwith 3 months versus 6 months. While the IDEA trial enrolled no patients with SBA, extrapolation from these colon cancer data are reasonable in \nthe absence of any direct data regarding adjuvant treatment of SBA with \nthe caveat that, stage -for-stage, survival is worse for SBA than for colon \ncancer .\n58,59 \nData supporting the use of adjuvant chemoradiation are especially limited, \nwith a retrospective review of patients with resected, nonmetastatic duodenal adenocarcinoma showing that patients who received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (n = 550) had no significant improvement in survival \ncompared to those who received chemotherapy alone (n = 694), even in high- risk cases.\n83 Therefore, chemoradiation should be considered only in \nhighly select ed patients . \nMSI/MMR Status for Adjuvant Therapy  \nMSI/MMR  is an important piece of information to consider when deciding \nwhether to use adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II SBA.  \nMutation of MMR genes or modifications of these genes (eg, methylation) can result in MMR protein deficiency and MSI.\n84 Tumors showing the \npresence of MSI are classified as either MSI -H or MSI -low (MSI -L), \ndepending on the extent of instability in the markers tested, whereas tumors without this characteristic are classified as microsatellite- stable \n(MSS).\n85 Patients determined to have dMMR status are biologically the \nsame population as those with MSI -H status.  \nData from several large studies in colon cancer have shown that MSI -H \n(ie, dMMR) tumors have a decreased likelihood to metastasize and that \nMSI-H/dMMR may function as a prognostic marker for favorable outcomes \nin stage II disease.86-88 Some of these same studies also show that a \ndMMR /MSI-H tumor status may be a predictive marker of decreased \nbenefit and possibly a detrimental impact from adjuvant therapy in patients \nwith stage II colon cancer .87-89 However, a study of 1913 patients with \nstage II CRC from the QUASAR study, half of whom received adjuvant \nchemotherapy, showed that although dMMR was prognostic, it did not \npredict benefit or detrimental impact of chemotherapy.90 A study of \npatients in the CALGB 9581 and 89803 trials came to a similar conclusion , \nthough notably this used older, non- standard chemotherapy regimens .91 \nExtrapolating from these colon cancer data , patients with stage II MSI-\nH/dMMR  SBA may have a good prognosis and the  benefit from adjuvant \ntherapy  is unclear . \nNCCN Recommendations for Adjuvant Therapy  \nBased on the limited data available from retrospective studies  of SBA, and \nextrapolation from studies of colon cancer  the NCCN Panel recommends:  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:04:25 PM.

Following adjuvant systemic \ntherapy, sequential c hemoradiation with capecitabine or \ninfusional 5- FU may be considered for stage III duodenal cancer  \nthat is margin -positive following resection.  \n• Observation or adjuvant treatment with 3 to 6 months of \nCAPEOX or 6 months of FOLFOX , 5-FU/LV, or capecitabine for \nstage II tumors that are MSS or MMR proficient ( pMMR ) and \nhave high- risk features.  High-risk features include T4 stage,  \nclose or positive surgical margins, few lymph nodes examined \n(<5 for duodenal or <8 for jejunal/ileal primary tumor location), or tumor perforation.\n40,60,76  Studies in CRC,  and a  retrospective \nreport in SBA,  have identi fied lymphovascular or  perineural \ninvasion  and poorly differentiated histology as poor prognostic \nfactors .76,92 -94 Therefore , adjuvant therapy may be considered for \npatients with these factors as well.  Following adjuvant systemic \ntherapy, sequential chemoradiation with capecitabine or \ninfusional 5- FU may be considered for high- risk stage II duodena l \ncancer that  is mar gin-positive following resection.  \n• Observation or 6 months of adjuvant treatment with  5-FU/LV or \ncapecitabine for T3, N0, M0 (stage IIA) tumors that are MSS or \npMMR and have no high- risk features.  \n• Observation following surgical treatment for all stage I tumors and for stage II tumors that are MSI -H or dMMR.  \nPrimary Treatment of Unresectable Disease \nFor some patients with locally unresectable or medically inoperable SBA, \nconversion to resectable disease may be a goal. A limited amount of data has demonstrated that neoadjuvant therapy may be beneficial in \nconverting unresectable SBA to resectable disease. A retrospective study \nof patients with unresectable or recurrent duodenal adenocarcinoma who were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation found tha t 9 out of 10 patients showed conversion to resectable disease following neoadjuvant ther apy. At the time of data collection, 5  patients were still \nalive (ranging from 18– 83 months postoperatively), suggesting prolonged \nsurvival following conversion to resectable disease.\n95 In addition, \nneoadjuvant chemoradiation was studied in two small prospective trials. A  \nphase II trial including patients with duodenal or pancreatic \nadenocarcinomas  reported that 4  of 5 patients with tumors in the \nduodenum  were able to undergo resection following neoadjuvant \nchemoradiation.96 Another small prospective study of  patients with \nduodenal or pancreatic adenocarcinomas  reported that a ll 4 patients with \nduodenal cancer underwent curative resection following neoadjuvant chemoradiation and experienced a complete pathologic response.\n97  \nSince many small bowel cancers present at an advanced stage, malignant \nsmall bowel obstruction is a common complication. One retrospective Eastern European study reported that most patients with small bowel \ncancer presented due to an emergency situation,\n41 with obstruction being \na common complication for SBA, accounting for 22% to 57.9% of these \ncases.41,98 -100 Malignant small bowel obstruction may be treated palliatively \nwith either surgical diversion or stenting. While most of the literature on palliative treatment of malignant  small bowel obstruction comes from \npancreatic cancer, there are a few studies that include SBA cases .\n41,101 -104 \nOne retrospective study concluded that there was no difference in post -\nstent survival between patients with pancreatic and nonpancreatic \ncancers,  and that patients with nonpancreatic cancers (including SBA) \nshowed a longer OS .101 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:04:25 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nSmall Bowel Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-10 Based on these data, the Panel recommends that  patients with locally \nunresectable or medically inoperable SBA may under go neoadjuvant \ntherapy, during which they should be routinely monitored for conversion to \nresectable disease. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation may be indicated for \nduodenal disease that remains unresectable following a course of \ninduction chemotherapy , but degree of benefit is controversial and should \nbe considered on an individual case basis . Alternatively, in cases where \nconversion to resectabl e disease is not feasible, palliative chemotherapy \nmay be considered.  Palliative diversion or stenting is recommended if a \nsmall bowel obstruction is present.  \nTreatment of Distant Metastatic (Stag e IV) S mall Bowel \nAdenocarcinoma  \nApproximately 32% of pa tients diagnosed with SBA  have stage I V (distant \nmetastatic) disease.40 The most common sites for metastatic spread \ninclude the peritoneal cavity and liver, consistent with other gastrointestinal malignancies.\n6 While 5 -year survival is relatively high \n(85%) for localized disease, patients with stage IV SBA have a 5- year \nrelative survival of only 42%.105 In addition, recurrence rates of localized \nSBA treated with surgery are high, with many of these patients developing \ndistant metastases.36 The NCCN recommendations for treatment of stage \nIV SBA are discussed below.  \nMetastasectomy  \nWhile resectable metastases are rare for SBA and t he data supporting \nmetastasectomy for SBA are  limited, a retrospective analysis of patients \nwith non- CRC,  nonendocrine liver metastases (including 28 patients with \nsmall bowel cancers and 12 patients with duodenal cancers) showed \npromising survival rates following resection of liver metastases.106 The 5-\nyear survival rate for small bowel cancers was 49% with a median survival of 58 months. For duodenal cancers, the 5- year survival rate was 21% \nwith a median survival of 34 months.  In addition, another retrospective study of 34 patients undergoing resection of SBA metastases reported a \nmedian OS of 28.2 months and a relapse- free survival of 18.7 months.\n107 \nIn total, 44.1% of patients in this study survived > 3 years and 88.2% of \npatients in this study received perioperative chemotherapy. Poor \ndifferentiation, invaded margins, and lymphatic invasion of the primary \ntumor were identified as poor prognostic factors. Therefore,  certain \npatients with SBA and limited metastasis to visceral organs  may be \ncandidates for metastasectomy. If metastasectomy is being considered, a \nmultidisciplinary team, including a surgeon experienced in the resection of \nmetastases, shoul d be consulted.  \nPeritoneal Carcinomatosis \nPeritoneal carcinomatosis (peritoneal metastases) has been shown to \naffect 25% to 50% of patients with stage IV SBA. Peritoneal \ncarcinomatosis occurs more frequently in tumors arising from the jejunum \nor ileum and less commonly in duodenal tumors.108 Peritoneal \ncarcinomatosis generally  carries a poor prognosis with a reported median \nOS of 5.9 months.109 The goal of treatment for unresectable peritoneal \nmetastases is palliative  and primarily consists of systemic therapy (see \nSystemic Therapy  for Metastatic Disease) .  \nFor r esectable peritoneal carcinomatosis , surgical cytoreduction may be \nconsidered. For peritoneal metastases that present  synchronously with the \nprimary tumor, resection of the primary a nd cytoreduction of peritoneal \nmetastases  may be carried out concurrently . A multidisciplinary team \nevaluation at an experienced center i s important if considering this \ntreatment approach.  Data supporting the use of hyperthermic \nintraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for SBA with peritoneal carcinomatosis are extremely limited, consisting entirely of small, retrospective studies.\n109-114 In addition, a phase III PRODIGE 7 study \nshowed no benefit of oxaliplatin- based HIPEC in patients with CRC \ncompared to cytoreduction alone.115 Significant morbidity and mortality are PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:04:25 PM.

Various studies have reported morbidity \nrates ranging from 19% to 31% for serious adverse events (AEs) and \nmortality rates ranging from 0% to 4%.110-114 Furthermore, recurrences \nafter the procedure are common.113,114  Based on this lack of evidence, \nHIPEC cannot be recommended for this population unless more robust data become available.  \nSystemic Therapy for Metastatic Disease \nData supporting systemic  therapy  for advanced adenocarcinoma of the \nsmall bowel were also almost entirely limited to retrospective reports,\n116-119 \nalthough recently several small  phase II trials for SBA have been reported.  \nBased on the results from these studies, several systemic therapy \nregimens are recommended for treatment of metastatic SBA.  However, \nparticipation in clinical trials is especially encouraged for patients with SBA \nbased on the lack of data.  \nThe choice of therapy is based on consideration of the goals of therapy,  \nthe type and timing of prior therapy , and the differing toxicity profiles of the \nconstituent drugs.  Further more , an evaluation of the efficacy and safety of \nthese regimens for an individual patient must take into account the \nperformance status of the patient. As initial therapy for advanced disease \nwhere intensive therapy is recommended (ie, a patient  with a good \ntolerance for this therapy and for whom a high tumor response rate would \nbe potentially beneficial) , the Panel recommends a choice of  combination \nchemotherapy regimens:  FOLFOX, CAPEOX, FOLFIRI (infusional 5- FU \nplus irinotecan), or FOLFIRINOX  (infusional 5- FU, LV, oxaliplatin, \nirinotecan) ; any of which may be combined with bevacizumab. For patients \nfor whom intensive thera py is not recommended, treatment options would \nexclude the more toxic components of these regimens  with 5 -FU/LV or \ncapecitabine with or without bevacizumab recommended as first -line \ntherapy for these patients.  For both intensive and non- intensive therapy, \nthe checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab or nivolumab, with or without ipilimumab, are recommended as initial therapy options for tumors that are \ndMMR/MSI -H. \nFor subsequent lines of therapy, many of the chemotherapy regimens recommended as first -line options may  be given as  subsequent line, if not \ngiven previously . In addition,  taxane -based chemotherapies are also \noptions for non- first line therapy . Checkpoint inhibitors are an option for \ndMMR/MSI -H disease  or POLE/POLD 1 mutation  with ultra -hypermutated \nphenotype if a checkpoint inhibitor was  not previously given.  Larotrectinib, \nentrectinib, or repotrectinib are options in subsequent lines of therapy for \nmetastatic SBA with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase ( NTRK ) gene \nfusion and no satisfactory alternative treatments. Finally, selpercatinib is an option in subsequent lines of therapy for rearranged during transfection \n(RET) gene fusion- positive metastatic SBA  and no satisfactory alternative \ntreatments . \nGenetic Alterations in SBA  \nEmerging research has shown that SBA has a distinct genetic profile,  \nwhich sets it apart from CRC  or gastroesophageal cancers, the two cancer \ntypes SBA is most often likened to. While KRAS and TP53  alterations are \nfrequently identified in both SBA and CRC, APC mutations are significantly \nless common in SBA (27% in SBA vs. 76% in CRC; P < .001).35 \nConsidering the near ubiquity of APC  mutation and its well -established \nrole in CRC carcinogenesis, this suggests that neoplastic transformation in \nSBA is unique compared to CRC.34,35   \nSMAD4  and CDKN2A  mutations are more commonly seen compared to \ngastroesophageal cancers  and CRC. Though BRAF  mutations occur at a \nsimilar rate as seen in CRC, only 10% of BRAF -mutant SBAs have a \nV600E alteration,  compared with > 70% in BRAF -mutant CRC.35 \nImportantly, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) alterations , \nMSI-H/dMMR, programmed death- ligand 1 ( PD-L1) expression, and tumor \nmutational burden- high (TMB -H) are enhanced in SBA compared to PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:04:25 PM.

One study showed higher rates of PD -L1 positivity in SBA \nassociated with Crohn’s or celiac disease, compared with sporadic SBA.123 \nRegimens Not Recommended for SBA  \nWhile many of the systemic therapy regimens recommended for treatment \nof metastatic SBA are extrapolated from data for CRC, there are several \nregimens commonly used for metastatic CRC that are not recommended \nfor SBA based either on a lack of data supporti ng their use or data \nsuggesting that these regimens do not work for metastatic SBA.  \nA 2017 retrospective analysis reported that  the efficacy of cetuximab-\ncontaining chemotherapy for RAS wild-type SBA was inconclusive .124 \nSubsequently , a phase II trial published in 2018 showed that panitumuma b \nhas no clinically meaningful activity in RAS wild-type SBA125; therefore, \ncetuximab or panitumumab should not be used for treatment of SBA.  \nWhile trifluridine -tipiracil or  regorafenib are recommended as subsequent \ntherapy options for metastatic CRC, there are no data to support their use \nfor SBA and are, therefore, not recommended.  \nFOLFOX or CAPEOX   \nBoth FOLFOX and CAPEOX have been evaluated prospectively for first-\nline treatment of advanced SBA in phase II clinical trials. One of these \ntrials evaluated  CAPEOX in 30 patients with advanced adenocarcinoma s \nof the small bowel and ampulla of Vater . The overall response rate (ORR) \n(the primary endpoint ) was 50%, with 10% achiev ing a complete \nresponse.126 A similar response rate of 48.5%  (95% CI, 31% –67%)  was \nseen in another small phase II study  of 33 patients  that assessed the \nefficacy of FOLFOX  in first -line treatment of advanced SBA .127 Likewise, \nanother phase II study reported an ORR of 45% for 24 patients with \nmetastatic or unresectable SBA  who were treated with FOLFOX, with a median progression- free survival ( PFS)  and OS of 5.9 and 17.3 months, \nrespectively.128 These response rates to CAPEOX and FOLFOX were \nmuch higher than the 18% response rate seen in another small phase II \nstudy that evaluated 5 -FU/doxorubicin/ mitomycin C in patients with  \nmetas tatic SBA.129 AEs reported across these three trials were similar, \nwith neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, and fatigue reported most frequently.\n126-128 \nRetrospective studies have supported the results of these trials, reporting \nthat the combination of a fluoropyrimidine with oxaliplatin was the most \neffective first -line therapy for advanced SBA.118,130,131  Based on these data , \nFOLFOX or CAPEOX are recommended as first -line therapy options for \ntreatment of patients with advanced SBA who are appropriate for intensive \ntherapy.  FOLFOX or CAPEOX may also be appropriate as subsequent \ntherapy if not given as first -line therapy, although there is a lack of data for \ntheir use in this setting.  \nResults of the OPTIMOX1 study showed that a “stop -and-go” approach \nusing oxaliplatin -free intervals resulted in decreased neurotoxicity but did \nnot affect OS  in patients with CRC receiving FOLFOX as initial therapy for \nmetastatic disease .132 Other trials have also addressed the question of \ntreatment breaks, with or without maintenance therapy, and found that toxicity can be minimized with minimal or no effect on survival.\n133,134  \nTherefore, the P anel recommends adjusting the schedule/timing of \noxaliplatin  as a means of limiting AEs . Discontinuation of oxaliplatin from \nFOLFOX or CAPEOX should be strongly considered after 3  months of \ntherapy, or sooner for unacceptable neurotoxicity, with other drugs in the regimen maintained for the entire 6 months or until time of tumor progression. Patients experiencing neurotoxicity on oxaliplatin should not \nreceive subsequent oxaliplatin therapy until and unless they experience \nnear-total resolution of that neurotoxicity.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nSmall Bowel Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-13 FOLFIRINOX   \nWhile the role of FOLFIRINOX  for treatment of SBA has not been formally \nevaluated, CAPIRINOX  (capecitabine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin)  has been \ntested  as first -line treatment in a phase II trial of 33 patients with advanced \nSBA.135 In this trial, CAPIRINOX —dose- adjusted according to UGT1A1  \ngenotype—showed a response rate of 37.5% (95% CI, 21% –56%), with a \nmedian PFS and OS of 8.9 and 13.4 months, respectively. Neither \nhematologic toxicity nor tumor response rate differed significantly by UGT1A1  genotype, supporting the feasibility of genotype- directed dosing \nfor CAPIRINOX. The NCCN Panel does not recommend use of \nCAPIRINOX  for SBA due to concerns about toxicity, but the \nrecommendation for FOLFIRINOX  is extrapolated from the results of this \nstudy.  \nFOLFOX, CAPEOX , or FOLFIRINOX  Plus Bevacizumab   \nWhile data supporting the addition of biologics to FOLFOX, CAPEOX,  or \nFOLFIRINOX  are currently extremely limited, a single- phase II trial has \nreported that CAPEOX in combination with bevacizumab is safe and \nefficacious  in patients with SBA.136 Retrospective analyse s have supported \nthese results, reporting favorable outcomes in patients treated with \nbevacizumab -containing chemotherapy regimens  without adding \nsignificant toxicity .124,137  Based on these data, FOLFOX , CAPEOX, or \nFOLFIRINOX  may be given with or without  bevacizumab for treatment of \nadvanced SBA.  \nA biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to  and has no \nclinically meaningful differences from an existing biologic therapy. Several \nbiosimilars are now available in the U.S. market, including biosimilars to \nbevacizumab.138,139  The NCCN Panel has agreed that an U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA)-approved biosimilar may be substituted for \nbevacizumab wherever it is recommended within the NCCN Guidelines for Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma.  Pembrolizumab , Nivolumab  ± Ipilimumab , or Dostarlimab -gxly (for \ndMMR/MSI -H tumors  or POLE/POLD1 mutation  with ultra -hypermutated  \nphenotype )  \nPembrolizumab is a PD -1 inhibitor that was evaluated as a subsequent -\nline therapy for treatment -refractory metastatic cancers in a phase 2 study \nthat included 3 cohorts: 1) dMMR  colorectal adenocarcinomas ; 2) MMR -\nproficient colorectal adenocarcinomas ; and 3) dMMR cancer s of types \nother than CRC .140 This third cohort included 2 patients with small bowel \ncancers. The immune- related objective response rate and immune- related \nPFS rate were 40% and 78%, respectively , for patients with dMMR CRC \nand 71% and 67% for patients  with dMMR non- CRC. Common AEs  of \nclinical interest included rash or pruritus; thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, or \nhypophysitis; and asymptomatic pancreatitis.140 Based on the results of \nthis study, the FDA  granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab in \nMay 2017 for patients with unresectable or metastatic dMMR or MSI -H \nsolid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.\n141  \nMore recently, other phase II studies of pembrolizumab have included \npatients with previously treated SBA. The KEYNOTE -158 study enrolled \n233 patients with dMMR/MSI -H advanced non- CRC, including 19 patients \nwith SBA.142 For the whole study population, ORR was 34.3%, with a \nmedian PFS of 4.1 months and median OS of 23.5 months. For SBA specifically, ORR was 42.1%, including three complete responses, media n \nPFS was 9.2 months, and the median duration of response and OS  had \nnot been reached at the time of publication. The ZEBRA study evaluated \nthe efficacy of pembrolizumab in 40 patients with previously treated, \nadvanced SBA, regardless of MMR/MSI status .\n143 While pembrolizumab \ndid not achieve the goal ORR for this study, 50% of patients with MSI -H \ntumors  (n=4)  had a partial response to therapy and remained alive without \nprogression at the time of data collection.

On this study, 63% of patients had grade ≥ 3 AEs \nand 28% had AEs of grade 4 or 5.  \nAnother PD -1 inhibitor, nivolumab—alone or in combination with the \nCTLA -4 inhibitor, ipilimumab —has been studied in patients with dMMR \nmetastatic CRC in the phase II , multi -cohort  CheckMate -142 trial.144,145  \nOne cohort of this trial included 74 patients with dMMR CRC who were \ntreated with nivolumab. ORR for these patients was 31.1% (95% CI, 20.8–\n42.9) , with 69% of patients having disease control for at least 12 weeks. \nMedian duration of response had not yet been reached at the time of data collection. PFS and OS were 50% and 73%, respectively, at 1 year. Grade 3 or 4 drug- related AEs occurred in 20% of patients, with increased \namylase and increased lipase being the most common.\n144 Another cohort \nof the CheckMate- 142 trial included 119 patients with dMMR CRC who \nwere treated with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab. For this cohort, ORR was 55% (95% CI, 45.2– 63.8) and the disease control rate \nfor at least 12 weeks was 80%. PFS and OS were 71% and 85%, respectively, at 1 year. In addition, significant, cl inically meaningful \nimprovements were observed in patient -reported outcomes of functioning, \nsymptoms, and quality of life. Grade 3 to 4 treatment -related AEs occurred \nin 32% of patients, but were manageable.\n145 The phase II DART SWOG \nS1609 trial , which tested nivolumab plus ipilimumab in rare tumors , has \npublished an abstract reporting results for a cohort of patients with small \nbowel cancer (n = 25).146 For the 23 patients who received treatment on \nthis cohort, ORR was 8% (with 1 complete and 1 partial response). \nMedian PFS and OS was 2 and 6 months, respectively.  Furthermore, the \nsafety and efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy in previously treated solid tumors was evaluated in the KM -06 open- label, multicenter, single- arm, \nphase II trial for tumors harboring genetic alterations in DNA damage response and repair (DDR)  genes leading to MSI and TMB -H. The trial \nconsisted of 48 patients mostly with colorectal cancer (41.7%) and with an \nMSI score of > 2.5 in addition to a TMB of > 12 mutations/Mb.\n147 Partial response was achieved by 8 patients resulting in a 17.8% ORR, median \nprogression- free survival was 2.9 months, and a disease control rate of \n60%; however, most patients (91.7%) experienced a treatment related adverse event of ≥ 3.\n147 It is important to note that nivolumab monotherapy \nis not currently recommended in MSS/TMB -H setting.  \nA third humanized IgG4  PD-1 blocking antibody , dostarlimab -gxly, has \nbeen FDA -approved for the treatment of adult patients with dMMR \nrecurrent or advanced solid tumors that have progressed on or following \ntreatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.148  \nThe safety and efficacy of dostarlimab- gxly was evaluated in the ongoing \nphase I GARNET study of patients with advanced solid tumors who had \npreviously received systemic therapy for advanced disease.149,150  In the \nentire efficacy population for patients with dMMR and MSI -H or POLE \nmutated tumors (n  = 327).

Based on \nthese positive results for CRC, and the data showing benefit of \npembrolizumab in SBA, the NCCN Panel recommends pembrolizumab;  \nnivolumab, with or without ipilimumab ; or dostarlimab- gxly as subsequent -\nline treatment options for dMMR/MSI -H or POLE/POLD1  mutation positive \nadvanced SBA .  \nPembrolizumab for Tumor Mutational Burden ( TMB)-High (>10 mut/Mb ) \nPembrolizumab has also been FDA -approved as a treatment for \nunresectable or metastatic, TMB -H solid tumors that have progressed \nfollowing prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment \noptions.141 TMB -H is defined in the label as  ≥10 mutations/megabase by \nan FDA -approved test.  Multiple studies have demonstrated TMB -H in \napproximately 9% to 11% of SBA solid tumors  samples , which was \nsignificantly higher than CRC (4.3%)  suggesting treatment implications \nwith checkpoint inhibitors in the SBA population.35,155 The approval  of \npembrolizumab was based off results of the phase 2, KEYNOTE -158 \nstudy that enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors.156 Patients with \nTMB -H tumors who were treated with pembrolizumab had an ORR of 29% \ncompared to 6% of those with non– TMB -H tumors. However, of the 796 \npatients who were evaluated for efficacy in this study, none had small \nbowel or colorectal cancers.  Additionally, the ZEBRA study had one patient  achieve a PR  with low MSS and a high TMB .143 The phase II \nTAPUR basket study reported results for 27 patients with TMB -H \nadvanced CRC who were treated with pembrolizumab.157 One partial \nresponse and seven cases with stable disease for at least 16 weeks were \nreported, for a disease control rate of 28% and an ORR of 4%.  A \nretrospective, single -center study that included three patients with TMB -H \nsmall intestine or duodenal cancer reported that only one of these three \ncases demonstrated a partial response to pembrolizumab.158  \nFurthermore, in 2017 a prospective analysis performed by Schrock et al . \ncompared genomic profiles of SBA (n = 317) to CRC (n = 6353) and \ngastric carcinomas (GC) (n  = 889). Of the entire cohort,  9.5%  (n = 30) of \nSBA samples had a TMB of >20 mutations/Mb compared to 4.3% (n = \n276) of CRC samples  (P = .001)  and 5.6% (n = 50) of GC samples ( P = \n.03). Although, MSS was not specified in the TMB -H population;  of the \nentire cohort,  49% (n = 156) of SBA samples were MSS.35 Based on \nemerging data for SBA, the NCCN Panel believes TMB biomarker testing \nshould be considered for all patients with metastatic disease. \nPembrolizumab monotherapy  is an NCCN category 2B  recommended \ntreatment option for patients with TMB -H (>10 mut/Mb)  advanced SBA \nsolid tumors.  \nDabrafenib plus T rametinib (for BRAF V600E -positive tumors)  \nTreatment combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib blocks MAPK pathway signaling while inhibiting growth and survival of BRAF -V600E \nmutated cells, in addition to enforcing anti -tumor activity.\n159 Data suggests \nthe prevalence of BRAF  V600E mutated solid tumors in SBA  is consistent \nwith that of mCRC and is detected in 5% to 10% of patients.160 A \nprospective analysis by Schrock et al . reported BRAF  mutation in 9.1% (n \n= 29 of 317) and of those 29 patients 10.3% (n = 3 of 29) were BRAF  \nV600E mutation positive. 35 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:04:25 PM.

Of the 10 patients with SBA who were evaluable for efficacy, 2 showed a partial response to nab-\npaclitaxel  and an additional 3 had stable disease per RECIST criteria, \nyielding a disease control rate of 50%. Common grade 3 or 4 toxicities \nacross the entire study population included fatigue (12%), neutropenia \n(9%), febrile neutropenia (9%), dehydration (6%), and thrombocytopenia \n(6%).\n165 \nA single -center, retrospective review reported on 20 patients with \nadvanced SBA who were treated with taxane- based therapy (either as \nsingle therapy or in combination).166 Of these cases, 30% showed disease \nresponse, 35%  showed stable disease, and 35% showed progression. \nMedian time to progression was 3.8 months (95% CI, 2.9– 4.6) and media n \nOS was 10.7 months (95% CI, 3.1– 18.3). Based  on these data, taxane -\nbased chemotherapy is a recommended option for second-  or \nsubsequent -line therapy , although only nab- paclitaxel has prospective, \npublished data  to support its use for treatment of SBA . FOLFIRI  \nA retrospective, multicenter study evaluated the efficacy of FOLFIRI as second- line therapy for patients with advanced SBA who had received \nplatinum -based chemotherapy in the first -line setting.\n167 Of the 28 patients \nwho fit this treatment paradigm, the ORR was 20% and disease control rate was 52%. The median PFS and OS were 3.2 and 10.5 months. Grade 3–4 toxicity was reported in 48% of patients. Based on these data, \nFOLFIRI is recommended as a treatment option for second-  or \nsubsequent -line treatment of advanced SBA. While FOLFIRI has not been \nstudied as first -line treatment  for advanced SBA , it may be a reasonable \nfirst-line option for some  patients based on extrapolation of studies in CRC \nand the regimen’s differing toxicity profile compared to oxaliplatin-\ncontaining regimens.  \nLarotrectinib, Entrectinib , or Repotrectinib  (for NTRK gene fusion -positive \ntumors)   \nA pooled analysis of 3 studies (a phase 1 including adults, a phase 1/2 \ninvolving children, and a phase 2 involving adolescents and adults) \nstudied the safety and efficacy of larotrectinib in patients with NTRK  gene \nfusion-positive tumors, including 4 patients with colon cancer and 1 with \ncancer of the appendix .168 For the whole population, the ORR was 75% \n(95% CI, 61% –85%) by independent review and 80% (95% CI, 67% –90%) \nby investigator assessment. Larotrectinib was found to be well -tolerated as \nthe majority (93%) of AEs  were grades 1 or 2 and no treatment -related \nAEs of grades 3 or 4 occurred in > 5% of patients.168  \nAn integrated analysis of three global phase I/II studies (ALKA -372-001, \nSTARTRK- 1, and STARTRK -2) tested the efficacy and safety of \nentrectinib in 54 adult patients with advanced or metastatic NTRK  gene \nfusion- positive solid tumors.169 For the whole population, ORR was 57% \n(95% CI, 43.2% –70.8%), median PFS was 11 months (95% CI, 8.0– 14.9), \nand median OS was 21 months (95% CI, 14.9– not estimable) by \nindependent review.

Notably, a similar ORR (50% vs. \n60%) was observed among those with central nervous system metastasis, \nindicating that entrectinib has activity in this population. Entrectinib was \nfound to be well -tolerated as most treatment -related AEs were grade 1 or \n2 and managed with dose reduction, leading few (4%) patients to \ndiscontinue therapy due to treatment -related AEs.  \nThe phase I/II TRIDENT -1 trial tested repotrectinib in two cohorts of \npatients with NTRK gene fusion- positive advanced solid tumors;  40 \npatients in the NTRK TKI -naïve cohort, who received repotrectinib as  their \nfirst NTRK TKI treatment, and 48 patients in the NTRK TKI -pretreated \ncohort, who had already received larotrectinib or entrectinib.170 One patient  \non the NTRK TKI -naïve cohort had CRC and two had CRC in the NTRK  \nTKI-pretreated cohort. An abstract presented at ESMO Congress 2023 \nreported a confirmed ORR of 58%, 12- month DOR of 86%, and 12- month \nPFS of 56% for the TKI -naïve group and a confirmed ORR of 50%, 12-\nmonth DOR of 39%, and 12- month PFS of 22% for the TKI -pretreated \npopulation. Grade ≥3 treatment -emergent AEs occurred in 51% of patients  \n(29% were treatment -related), with dizziness being most common.  \nTreatment discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 7% of patients.  \nAlthough there were no SBA patients in the TRIDENT trial , treatment \nimplications are based on the data extrapolated from the patients with \nCRC. Based on these data, the FDA has approved larotrectinib,  \nentrectinib, and repotrectinib for metastatic solid tumors with NTRK  gene \nfusion and no satisfactory alternative treatment ,105 and the NCCN Panel \nrecommends these therapies as options for subsequent -line treatment of \nmetastatic SBA that is NTRK  gene fusion positive.  \nSelpercatinib (for RET gene fusion -positive tumors)  \nIn the ongoing phase 1/2  LIBRETTO -001 trial, the efficacy and safety of \nthe highly selective RET kinase inhibitor selpercatinib is being investigated in a diverse group of patients with RET  gene fusion- positive tumors, \nincluding 10 patients with colon cancer and 1 patient with small bowel \ncancer.171 Patients in this trial had received a median of 2 prior lines of \nsystemic therapy  and 31% of patients received 3 or more prior lines of \ntreatment . Of a total of 41 efficacy- evaluable patients, the ORR by \nindependent review was 43.9% (95% CI, 28.5% –60.3%). There were 2 \ncomplete responses (5%), including the one patient with small bowel \ncancer involved in the study. By independent review, the median duration of response for the patient  with small bowel cancer was 24.5 months. For \nthe entire cohort, median PFS was 13.2 months (95% CI, 7.4– 26.2) by \nindependent review , median OS was 18 months  (95% CI, 10.7– not \nevaluable) , and median duration of response was 24.5 months (95% CI, \n9.2–not evaluable). The most common grade 3 or higher treatment \nemergent  AEs were hypertension and transaminitis.  The most common \ntreatment -related serious AEs were drug- induced livery injury, fatigue, and \nhypersensitivity. One patient had to permanently discontinue selpercatinib \ndue to drug- induced liver injury.   \nBased on these data, the FDA has approved selpercatinib for locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a RET  gene fusion that have \nprogressed on or following prior systemic treatment or who have no \nsatisfactory alternative treatment options.\n172  \nPosttreatment Surveillance \nAfter  curative -intent surgery  and adjuvant chemotherapy, if administered, \npost-treatment surveillance of  patients with SBA  is performed to evaluate \nfor possible therapeutic complications, identify disease recurrence, and \ndiscover  new metachronous neoplasms at a preinvasive stage. A \nretrospective study of 146 patients with SBA who underwent cancer -\ndirected surgery found that 39% subsequently developed disease recurrence, with a median time to recurrence of 25 months.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nSmall Bowel Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-19 developed carcinomatosis, 7% recurred in the abdominal wall, and 17% \ndeveloped local recurrences.36 Due to the lack of data regarding optimal \nsurveillance following curative- intent treatment of SBA, a similar approach \nto CRC surveillance is recommended—including history and physical \nexamination; CEA and/or CA 19- 9 measurement; and CT of the chest, \nabdomen, and pelvis . For data supporting the recommended surveillance \napproach for CRC, see the Posttreatment Surveillance section in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer . \nPatients with SBA who were determined to have Crohn’s disease or \nfamilial syndromes ( ie, Lynch  syndrome, FAP, PJS) may require more \nintensive surveillance due to their elevated risk of developing further SBAs.\n12,13 Endoscopy may be a feasible method for SBA surveillance in \npatients with Crohn’s disease,13,173 although one prospective study found a \nlow (33%) sensitivity rate for SBA endoscopic screening.174 A number of \nstudies have supported the use of endoscopy/enteroscopy for small bowel surveillance in patients with Lynch syndrome, FAP, or PJS.\n175-182 For \nfurther detail s on endoscopic small bowel  evaluation, see the section on \nImaging and Endoscopy  under Clinical Presentation and Workup, above.  \nSurvivorship  \nBased on the rarity and poor prognosis of SBA , there is a dearth of data \nregarding survivorship for this disease. The Panel recommendations for \nsurvivorship are largely extrapolated from the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer , with some specific recommendations included for patients with \nceliac or Crohn’s disease who are at elevated risk of developing additional \nSBAs.\n12,13,183  This section will provide an overview of the Panel \nrecommendations for survivorship; for more detailed information, see the \nSurvivorship  section in the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer . \nThe Panel recommends that a prescription for survivorship and transfer of \ncare to the pr imary care physician be written.184 The oncologist and primary care provider should have defined roles in the surveillance period, with roles communicated to the patient.  Other recommendations include \nmonitoring for late or long- term sequelae of treatment, such as oxaliplatin-\ninduced peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, pain, sexual dysfunction, and \nemotional or social distress.\n185-189 Specific management interventions to \naddress these and other side ef fects are described in a review.190 Disease \npreventive measures, such as immunizations; early disease detection \nthrough periodic screening for second primary cancers (eg, breast, cervical, or prostate cancers); and routine good medical care and \nmonitoring are recommended. T he NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship  \nprovide screening, evaluation, and treatment recommendations for \ncommon consequences of cancer and cancer treatment to aid health care \nprofessionals who work with survivors of adult -onset cancer in the post -\ntreatment period, including those in specialty ca ncer survivor clinics and \nprimary care practices.  \nSummary  \nSBA is a rare malignancy, with a rising incidence in recent decades. \nCompared to CRC, SBA is more often diagnosed at advanced stages, \nsuggesting the difficulty of detecting these cancers and highlighting the \nlack of screening programs, even for high- risk individuals. The majority of \nSBAs arise in the duodenum and are associated with poorer prognosis, \nwith up to a third of resectable patients experiencing early relapse. To \ndate, the only curative therapy for SBA is surgery.  \nFor local disease, segmental resection of the small bowel is the mainstay \nof treatment, though duodenal tumors may require either \npancreaticoduodenectomy or segmental duodenal resection.  Database \nanalyses have reported significantly improved outcomes when 8 or more \nlymph nodes are resected. In addition,  the use of radiation therapy for \nretroperitoneal -based duodenal adenocarcinomas is a complex decision-\nmaking process.
