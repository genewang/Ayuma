Radiology 2014;270:248-260.\nPANC-A\n1 OF 8Continued• Decisions about diagnostic management and resectability should involve multidisciplinary consultation at a high-volume center with \nreference to appropriate high-quality imaging studies to evaluate the extent of disease. Resections should be done at institutions that \nperform a large number (at least 15–20) of pancreatic resections annually. \n• High-quality dedicated imaging of the pancreas should be performed at presentation (even if standard CT imaging is already available), \npreferably within 4 weeks of surgery, and following neoadjuvant treatment to provide adequate staging and assessment of resectability \nstatus. Imaging should be done prior to stenting, when possible. Imaging with contrast as appropriate for disease management (unless \ncontraindicated).\n• Imaging should include dedicated pancreatic CT of abdomen (preferred) or MRI with contrast. \n\u0017Multidetector CT (MDCT) angiography, performed by acquiring thin, preferably sub-millimeter, axial sections using a dual-phase pancreatic \nprotocol, with images obtained in the pancreatic and portal venous phase of contrast enhancement, is the preferred imaging tool for \ndedicated pancreatic imaging.a Scan coverage can be extended to cover the chest and pelvis for complete staging as per institutional \npreferences. Multiplanar reconstruction is preferred as it allows precise visualization of the relationship of the primary tumor to the \nmesenteric vasculature as well as detection of subcentimeter metastatic deposits. See MDCT Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Protocol, \nPANC-A (3 of 8).\n\u0017MRI is most commonly used as a problem-solving tool, particularly for characterization of CT-indeterminate liver lesions and when \nsuspected pancreatic tumors are not visible on CT or when contrast-enhanced CT cannot be obtained (as in cases with severe allergy \nto iodinated intravenous [IV] contrast material). This preference for using MDCT as the main imaging tool in many hospitals and imaging \ncenters is mainly due to the higher cost and lack of widespread availability of MRI compared to CT. See MRI Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma \nProtocol, PANC-A (4 of 8).\n• The decision regarding resectability status should be made by consensus at multidisciplinary meetings/discussions following the \nacquisition of dedicated pancreatic imaging including complete staging. Use of a radiology staging reporting template is preferred to ensure \ncomplete assessment and reporting of all imaging criteria essential for optimal staging, which will improve the decision-making process.a \nSee Pancreatic Cancer Radiology Reporting Template, PANC-A (5 of 8).PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

It is not a substitute for high-quality, contrast-enhanced CT.\n• For neoadjuvant therapy, consider PET/CT or PET/MRI scan before and after initiation to assess response to systemic therapy and for \nrestaging.\n• EUS is not recommended as a routine staging tool. In select cases, EUS may be complementary to CT for staging. \n• EUS-guided biopsy is preferable to a CT-guided biopsy in patients with non-metastatic disease because of better diagnostic yield, safety, \nand potentially lower risk of peritoneal seeding when compared with the percutaneous approach. Biopsy proof of malignancy is not required \nbefore surgical resection, and a non-diagnostic biopsy should not delay surgical resection when the clinical suspicion for pancreatic cancer \nis high.\n• Diagnostic staging laparoscopy to rule out metastases not detected on imaging (especially for body and tail lesions) is used in some \ninstitutions prior to surgery or neoadjuvant therapy, or selectively in patients with high-risk featuresb and indicators of disseminated \ndisease. Intraoperative ultrasound can be used as a diagnostic adjunct during staging laparoscopy.\n• Positive cytology from washings obtained at laparoscopy or laparotomy is equivalent to M1 disease. If resection has been done for such a \npatient, the patient should be treated for M1 disease.\n• For locally advanced/metastatic disease, the Panel recommends serial CT with contrast (routine single portal venous phase or dedicated \npancreatic protocol if surgery is still contemplated) or MRI with contrast of known sites of disease to determine therapeutic benefit. However, \nit is recognized that patients can demonstrate progressive disease clinically without objective radiologic evidence of disease progression.\n• Recent retrospective studies suggest that imaging characteristics may not be a reliable indicator of resectability in patients with borderline \nresectable or locally advanced disease who have received neoadjuvant therapy. Determinations of resectability and surgical therapy should \nbe made on an individualized basis in a multidisciplinary setting (see Discussion for references).\nb Indicators of patients with high risk features may include equivocal or indeterminate imaging findings, markedly elevated CA  19-9, large primary tumors, \nor large regional lymph nodes.\nPANC-A\n2 OF 8PRINCIPLES OF DIAGNOSIS, IMAGING, AND STAGING\nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

However, this decision is best made in a multidisciplinary \ndiscussion.\n• In obstructive jaundice, it is best practice to perform an EUS needle biopsy and ERCP for biliary drainage in the same anesthesia session.\n• Biliary drainage before surgery may be considered for:\n\u0017Symptoms of cholangitis/fever\n\u0017Severe symptomatic jaundice (intense pruritus)\n\u0017If surgery is being delayed for any reason, including neoadjuvant therapy\n• Biliary drainage is best accomplished with an endoscopically placed biliary stent.\n• If ERCP fails, reattempt at a high-volume center should be considered.\n• If endoscopic drainage is not possible, a percutaneous biliary drain (PBD) should be considered. Alternatively, EUS-guided biliary drainage \nmay be considered at a high-volume center.\n• SEMS are preferable to plastic stents.\n• If the tissue diagnosis is not certain, fully covered SEMS should be considered, since these stents can be removed or exchanged.\n• If EUS with biopsy is repeated, the fully covered SEMS may be removed for better EUS visualization of the lesion, and biopsy. The SEMS may \nbe replaced after biopsy.\n• Once tissue diagnosis is confirmed, a non-removable (partially covered or bare) SEMS may be used, as the migration rate is lower in this \ntype of SEMS.\n•  Biliary stents should be as short as feasible.\n• Stent placement in the pancreatic duct may be indicated in special circumstances where there is persistent pancreatitis secondary to \nobstruction of the pancreatic duct, which precludes other therapy.\n• Plastic biliary stents may be considered for palliation in patients with predicted short survival of less than 3 months.\nTissue Acquisition\n• EUS-guided needle biopsy is the preferred mode of obtaining tissue for diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). \n• Preferably, a latest generation (\"core\") EUS needle should be used.\n• Image-guided biopsy methods (CT, ultrasound) are preferred for liver lesions suspicious of metastasis.\n• The preferred biopsy target should be the lesion that will provide the highest stage (eg, metastatic lesions).\n• In metastatic PDAC, enough tissue should be obtained for next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis.\n• For all needle biopsies, if safe and feasible, two extra needle passes should be performed in addition to the routine diagnostic passes, and \nstored for future NGS analysis if needed.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

Surgery should be done efficiently , optimizing quality of life and cost. The surgical procedure \nrequired is based on the location of the primary tumor and relationship to blood vessels. Therefore, a pancreatic protocol CT is critical for \npreoperative planning.\nConsider frozen section analysis of the pancreatic neck and bile duct. To avoid cautery artifact that may confound the frozen section, assess \nthe pancreatic neck and bile duct at time of surgery by frozen section approximately 5 mm from the transection margin. If tumor is located \nwithin 5 mm of margins, consider further excision of the pancreas and bile duct to ensure at least 5 mm of clearance. \nFor adenocarcinomas of the pancreas head and uncinate, a pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) is done. For adenocarcinomas of \nthe pancreas body and tail, a distal pancreatectomy with en-bloc splenectomy is done.\nPancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple technique)\nThe goals of surgical extirpation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma focus on the achievement of an R0 resection, as a margin-positive specimen \nis associated with poor long-term survival.1,2 Achievement of a margin-negative dissection must focus on meticulous perivascular dissection \nof the lesion in resectional procedures, recognition of the need for vascular resection and/or reconstruction, and the potential need for extra-\npancreatic organ resection. Of course, the biology of the cancer might not allow for an R0 resection even with the most meticulous surgery .\n• Medial dissection of pancreatic head lesions is best achieved by complete mobilization of the PV and SMV from the uncinate process \n(assuming no evidence of tumor infiltration). Skeletalization of the lateral, posterior , and anterior borders of the SMA down to the level of the \nadventitia will maximize uncinate yield and radial margin.3,4\n• In the absence of frank venous occlusion noted on preoperative imaging, the need for lateral venorrhaphy or complete portal or SMV \nresection and reconstruction to achieve an R0 resection may be suggested but is often not known until division of the pancreatic neck has \noccurred. Tethering of the adenocarcinoma to the lateral wall of the PV is not uncommon and requires careful dissection to free the vein from \nthe pancreatic head if in fact it is possible to do so. Differentiation of tumor infiltration into the vein wall from tumor-related desmoplasia \nis frequently impossible to ascertain. Data support an aggressive approach to partial or complete vein excision if tumor infiltration is \nsuspected.\n• While further data with respect to arterial resection are clearly needed, judicious utilization of this technique would appear to be reasonable \nin very select populations.\nReferences on PANC-D 3 of 3ContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

A local recurrence is usually defined as being isolated to \nthe bed of the pancreatic margin, the pancreatic remnant, or the mesenteric root. \nThere is a potential benefit of re-resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma recurrences in selected patients. These patients should be \ncarefully evaluated in the multidisciplinary clinic where following a detailed restaging assessment, a multimodal therapy care plan consisting \nof neoadjuvant chemotherapy, possible RT, and possible surgical resection can be formulated.\n \nDistal Pancreatectomy with En-bloc Splenectomy\nThe goals of left-sided resection are similar to those of pancreatoduodenectomy , although they are often more difficult to achieve due to the \nadvanced stage at which most of these adenocarcinomas are discovered. Plane of dissection anterior to adrenal gland or en bloc resection of \nleft adrenal gland with plane of dissection posterior to Gerota’s fascia is recommended as clinically indicated. \n• An R0 distal pancreatectomy for adenocarcinoma mandates en bloc organ removal beyond that of the spleen alone in up to 40% of \npatients.7,8\n• Similar to the Whipple procedure, lateral venorrhaphy, vein excision and reconstruction, and dissection to the level of the CA and SMA \nadventitia should be performed if complete tumor clearance can be achieved.7,9\n• Spleen preservation is not indicated in adenocarcinoma. \n \nManagement of Neck Lesions\nPancreas neck adenocarcinomas are especially difficult to manage. Adenocarcinomas in the pancreas neck are located anterior to the \nsuperior mesenteric vessels and PV. Depending on the extent of involvement, a pancreaticoduodenectomy extending to the left of the SMV \n(extended pancreaticoduodenectomy), a distal pancreatectomy extending to the right of the SMV (extended distal pancreatectomy), or a total \npancreatectomy may be required to obtain an R0 resection.10 \nThe precise extent of involvement often cannot be determined prior to surgery; therefore, complex intraoperative decisions are required, and \nthe surgeon must anticipate this. Complexity of surgery for pancreas neck adenocarcinomas is compounded by the frequent involvement of \nthe SMV/PV.10,11 Surgeons who operate on pancreas neck adenocarcinomas must anticipate possible SMV/PV involvement and be prepared to \nmanage it.\nReferences on PANC-D 3 of 3PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

There should be either direct communication between the surgeon and pathologist \nfor proper orientation and margin identification, or the surgeon should identify the important margins with a clearly understood and \ndocumented method (eg, written on the pathology requisition); for example: the distal and proximal margins of the SMV and SMA and the \nbile duct margin should be marked.\n• Margins\n\u0017Definitions of the margins and uniformity of nomenclature are critical to accurate reporting.\n ◊SMA (retroperitoneal/uncinate) Margin: The most important margin is the soft tissue directly adjacent to the proximal 3–4 cm of the SMA. \nThis margin is often referred to as the “retroperitoneal margin” or “posterior margin,” but has also been referred to as the “uncinate \nmargin” or “mesenteric margin.” More recently, this margin has been referred to as the “SMA margin” to correlate with its location on \nthe specimen. Radial, rather than en face, sections of this margin will more clearly demonstrate how closely this margin is approached \nby tumor. The uncinate margin should be inked. Rather than being submitted en face, the uncinate margin tissue should be shaved/\namputated, then the portion of tissue should be sectioned perpendicular to the ink and submitted entirely for histologic examination.\n ◊PV Margins: If an en bloc partial or complete vein resection is added to the surgical specimen, it should be marked separately. En face \nproximal and distal end margins of the vein should be separately submitted as “Proximal Portal Vein Margin” and “Distal Portal Vein \nMargin.” A section documenting tumor invasion into the vein wall should also be submitted. If feasible, this section should encompass \nthe full thickness of the vein wall, demonstrating the depth of tumor invasion, as this has been shown to have prognostic value.2\n ◊Pancreatic Neck (transection) Margin: This is the en face section of the transected pancreatic neck. Care should be taken when placing \nthe section into the cassette to document the orientation of the section with respect to the true margin (eg, facing down so that the initial \nsection into the block represents the true margin, or facing up so that the initial section represents the surface opposite the true margin).\n ◊Bile Duct Margin: This is the en face section of the bile duct end. The section should be removed from the unopened duct and care \nshould be taken when placing the section into the cassette to document the orientation of the section with respect to the true margin \n(eg, facing down so that the initial section into the block represents the true margin, or facing up so that the initial section represents the \nsurface opposite the true margin).\n\u0017Other margins analyzed in Whipple specimens include the proximal (gastric or enteric) and distal enteric margins (en face sections).\n\u0017Collectively, these margins and pancreatic tissue surfaces constitute the circumferential surface of the specimen. Designating the various \nspecific margins and surfaces with different colored inks will allow recognition on microscopy . \nPANC-E\n1 OF 5PATHOLOGIC ANALYSIS: SPECIMEN ORIENTATION, HISTOLOGIC SECTIONS, AND REPORTING\nThe primary purpose of pathologic analysis of the pancreatic specimen is to determine the pathologic stage of the tumor by evaluating the \ntype, grade, size, and extent of the cancer.\nReferences on PANC-E 5 of 5ContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

Radial, rather than en face, sections of this surface will more \nclearly demonstrate whether it is involved by tumor. In some instances, this surface may already be included in sections of the SMA \nmargin.\n\u0017SMV Groove: Also referred to as the vascular groove surface (and in previous versions of the Guidelines as the Portal Vein Groove Margin), \nthis is the smooth-surfaced groove on the posterior-medial surface of the pancreatic head that rests over the SMV. Radial, rather than en \nface, sections of this surface will more clearly demonstrate whether it is involved by tumor, and also will provide the distance of the tumor \nfrom the surface. As is true for the posterior (non-SMA margin) surface, in some instances, this surface may be included in the same \nsections as the SMA margin.\n\u0017Anterior Surface: The anterior surface is not a true margin, but identification and reporting of this surface when positive may portend a \nrisk of local recurrence, and is therefore strongly recommended, but not currently required.3-6 In some cases where the anterior surface \nis adherent to other structures, from which it is surgically dissected or transected, it should be considered an additional circumferential \nmargin, for which the closest distance from tumor should be reported.\n• Histologic Sectioning\n\u0017The approach to histologic sectioning is determined by the unique characteristics of the tumor , but is also influenced by institutional \npreferences, expertise, and experience. Options include axial, bi- or multi-valve slicing, and perpendicular slicing. Some experts in the field \nbisect the pancreas along probes placed in the bile and pancreatic ducts and then serially section along each half of the pancreas.\n\u0017Axial slicing provides an overall assessment of the epicenter of the tumor relative to the ampulla, bile duct, duodenum, and pancreas, and \nall of the pancreatic circumferential tissue margins mentioned above. \n\u0017There is no one correct way to dissect a Whipple specimen.7 However, knowledge of the clinically suspected lesion is helpful in choosing \nthe best dissection method for examination and appropriate characterization of the lesion. The most important aspects of dissection are \nclear and accurate assessment of the margins, size of the tumor, and relationship to the relevant structures, such as pancreatic surfaces, \nmargins, bile duct, main pancreatic duct, and duodenum. \n\u0017Per the current CAP protocol, the presence of tumor at or within 1 mm of resection margin constitutes a positive margin,3,8 although this \nrecommendation is based primarily on extrapolation of data on rectal adenocarcinoma. There is currently a lack of definitive evidence for \nwhat constitutes an adequate margin in pancreatic carcinoma resection specimens. A standardized definition of this would allow for better \nstratification of patients into adjuvant regimens following surgical extirpation. For instance, if less than 1-mm clearance is associated with \nan unacceptably high incidence of local recurrence, then strong consideration for postoperative RT might be indicated if not received \npreoperatively. Tumor clearance should be reported with millimeter accuracy for all margins where tumor is close (within ≤1.0 cm of the \ntumor). This may be done using either mm (eg, 2 mm) or cm (eg, 0.2 cm). For margins distant from tumor (>1.0 cm from tumor), tumor \nclearance may be reported with centimeter accuracy. Attached organs resected with the specimen en bloc require serial sectioning to \nassess not only direct extension, but metastatic deposits as well. One section that demonstrates direct invasion of the organ and/or a \nseparate metastatic deposit is required.\nPANC-E\n2 OF 5PATHOLOGIC ANALYSIS: SPECIMEN ORIENTATION, HISTOLOGIC SECTIONS, AND REPORTING\nContinued\nReferences on PANC-E 5 of 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

Additionally, involvement of the \nsplenic vessels should be documented, along with invasion of the spleen. Additionally, the margins of the splenic vein and artery can be \nshaved and submitted for histologic examination. \n• Margin and Circumferential Surface Definitions\n\u0017Proximal Pancreatic (transection) Margin: A full en face section of the pancreatic body along the plane of transection, if the tumor is grossly \n>1.0 cm from this margin. Care should be taken when placing the section into the cassette to document the orientation of the section with \nrespect to the true margin (eg, facing down so that the initial section into the block represents the true surgical margin, or facing up so that \nthe initial section represents the surface opposite the true margin). More than one block may be needed. If the tumor is grossly close to \nthe margin (eg, within ≤1.0 cm), the entire margin should be submitted for pathologic evaluation in a manner that allows for millimeter-level \naccuracy in documenting the distance of tumor from this margin. For example, the margin can be inked and shaved/amputated, followed by \nperpendicular sectioning with respect to the ink and submission of the entire margin for histologic examination.\n\u0017Anterior (cephalad) Peripancreatic (peripheral) Surface: This surface demonstrates the relationship between the tumor and the anterior \nor cephalad peripancreatic soft tissue and can be representative, if grossly positive. Several such sections should be taken closest to the \ntumor to document absence of involvement; the exact number is dependent on the degree of ambiguity of gross involvement.\n\u0017Posterior (caudad) Peripancreatic (peripheral) Surface: This surface demonstrates the relationship between the tumor and the posterior or \ncaudad peripancreatic soft tissue and can be representative, if grossly positive.

This includes neoadjuvant therapy (resectable or borderline resectable), \nadjuvant therapy, and first-line or subsequent therapy for locally advanced, metastatic, and recurrent disease.\n• Goals of systemic therapy should be discussed with patients prior to initiation of therapy, and enrollment in a clinical trial is strongly \nencouraged.\n• Consider testing for potentially actionable somatic findings including, but not limited to: fusions ( ALK, NRG1, NTRK, ROS1, FGFR2 , and \nRET), mutations ( BRAF, BRCA1/2, KRAS , and PALB2), amplifications ( HER2), microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch repair deficiency \n(dMMR), or tumor mutational burden (TMB) using comprehensive genomic profiling via an FDA-approved and/or validated NGS-based assay , \nand HER2 overexpression via IHC ± FISH.\n• Close follow-up of patients undergoing chemotherapy is indicated.\n• For regimens where RT or chemoradiation is included, Principles of Radiation Therapy (PANC-G) has more details related to radiation \ndelivery, including recommended technique and dose.\n• To optimize the care of older adults, see NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology . \n• Squamous/adenosquamous carcinomas are treated the same as adenocarcinoma. There are no data supporting the efficacy of any of the \nrecommended regimens for squamous/adenosquamous carcinomas.\n• An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines.PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY\na FOLFIRINOX or modified FOLFIRINOX should be limited to those with ECOG 0–1.\nb Chemoradiation (PANC-F 11 of 13)Neoadjuvant Therapy (Resectable/Borderline Resectable Disease)\n• There is limited evidence to recommend specific neoadjuvant regimens off-study , and practices vary with regard to the use of \nchemotherapy and radiation. Subsequent chemoradiation is sometimes included. If neoadjuvant therapy is considered or recommended, \ntreatment at or coordinated through a high-volume center is preferred, when feasible. Participation in a clinical trial is encouraged.\nPreferred Regimens Other Recommended Regimens Useful in Certain Circumstances\n• Fluorouracil (5-FU) + leucovorin + irinotecan + oxaliplatin \n(FOLFIRINOX) or modified FOLFIRINOXa ± subsequent \nchemoradiationb\n• Gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel ± subsequent \nchemoradiationb • None • None\nOnly for known BRCA1/2  or PALB2 mutations:\n• FOLFIRINOX or modified FOLFIRINOXa ± subsequent \nchemoradiationb\n• Gemcitabine + cisplatin (≥2 to 6 cycles) ± subsequent \nchemoradiationb\nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

Adjuvant Therapy\n• The CONKO-001 trial demonstrated significant improvements in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) with use of \npostoperative gemcitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation in resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.1 \n• ESPAC-3 study results showed no significant difference in OS between 5-FU/leucovorin versus gemcitabine following surgery. When the \ngroups receiving adjuvant 5-FU/leucovorin and adjuvant gemcitabine were compared, median survival was 23.0 months and 23.6 months, \nrespectively.2 \n• Data from ESPAC-4 support the use of gemcitabine combined with capecitabine (1660 mg/m2/day days 1–21 every 4 weeks) with superiority \ndemonstrated compared to gemcitabine alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68, 0.98; P = .032).3\n• No significant differences were observed in the RTOG 97-04 study comparing pre- and post-chemoradiation 5-FU with pre- and post-\nchemoradiation gemcitabine for postoperative adjuvant treatment.4 \n• Recommended adjuvant therapy options apply to patients who did not receive prior neoadjuvant therapy. For those who received \nprior neoadjuvant therapy, the adjuvant therapy options are dependent on the response to neoadjuvant therapy and other clinical \nconsiderations.\nPreferred Regimens Other Recommended Regimens Useful in Certain Circumstances\n• Modified FOLFIRINOX \n(category 1)a\n• Gemcitabine + \ncapecitabine (category 1)• Bolus 5-FU + leucovorin (category 1)\n• Gemcitabine (category 1)\n• Continuous infusion 5-FU\n• Chemotherapy followed by chemoradiationb,c:\n\u0017Bolus 5-FU + leucovorin\n\u0017Continuous infusion 5-FU\n\u0017Gemcitabine\n• Chemotherapy followed by chemoradiationb,c with subsequent \nchemotherapy4: \n\u0017Bolus 5-FU + leucovorin followed by chemoradiationb,c with subsequent \nbolus 5-FU + leucovorin\n\u0017Continuous infusion 5-FU followed by chemoradiationb,c with subsequent \ncontinuous infusion 5-FU\n\u0017Gemcitabine followed by chemoradiationb,c with subsequent gemcitabine\n• Capecitabine (category 2B)• NonePRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY\nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

Radiation can also be used to palliate pain and bleeding or relieve obstructive symptoms in patients \nwho have progressed or recurred locally.

Placement of fiducial markers directly into the tumor and/or periphery under EUS is preferred. Stents can \nassist with targeting; however, they can shift and are therefore less reliable than fiducials.\n• Position patient supine with arms up in an immobilization device that will be custom-made for each patient. The simulation scan range \nshould include the target structures and OARs. \n• Unless there is a contraindication to IV contrast, CT simulation (2- to 3-mm slices) should be performed with IV contrast whenever feasible \n(assuming adequate kidney function). Multiphase IV contrast delivery is preferred whenever possible to facilitate disease delineation. MRI \nimaging may be complementary to CT in target delineation. Neutral oral contrast may also be utilized.\n• Simulation and treatment of patient with nothing by mouth (NPO) may facilitate setup reproducibility. If the patient receives oral contrast, \nconsider giving the same volume of water prior to treatment each day to mimic simulation anatomy.\nMotion Management3:\n• A motion management strategy should be considered. \n• Respiratory motion should be accounted for in determining the internal target volume (ITV). These strategies may include using a 4D-CT \nscan, respiratory gating, breath-hold, respiratory tracking, or abdominal compression.\nPlanning, Dose and Fractionation :\n• 3-D conformal RT (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), and SBRT can result in improved planning target volume (PTV) coverage with \ndecreased dose to OARs.4,5 IMRT is preferred over 3D-CRT for conventional or hypofractionated RT, particularly if dose escalation is being \nconsidered. The exact planning strategy used should be individualized to patient anatomy, clinical scenario, treatment goals, and dose \ngoals.\n• It is imperative to evaluate the dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the target structures and the critical OARs such as the duodenum, stomach, \nliver, kidneys, spinal cord, and bowel. See Table 1. Normal Tissue Dose Volume Recommendations for Chemoradiation Utilizing Conventional \nFractionation ( PANC-G 5 of 6). No definitive dose constraints for SBRT currently exist; however , they are emerging and are dependent on a \nvariety of factors including dose per fraction and total dose.\n• While these examples of limits are empirical they differ based on dose per fraction, total dose delivered, and disease status (adjuvant vs. \nunresectable). \nContinued\nReferences on PANC-G 6 of 6PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY\nRECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON TREATMENT SETTINGa\na It is not known whether one regimen is necessarily more effective than another in the five clinical scenarios mentioned above. Therefore, \nthe following recommendations are given as examples of commonly utilized regimens. However , other recommendations based on similar \nprinciples are acceptable. See Principles of Systemic Therapy (PANC-F) for details on chemotherapy regimens used for chemoradiation.\nb Adjuvant options listed apply only to patients who did not receive prior neoadjuvant therapy. For those who received prior neoadjuvant therapy, \nthe adjuvant therapy options are dependent on the response to neoadjuvant therapy and other clinical considerations.Continued\nReferences on \nPANC-G 6 of 6PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

Options may include:\n\u0017Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation or SBRT in select \npatients (locally advanced without systemic metastases)c,d,18-23\n\u0017Chemoradiation,17 SBRT,c,d or hypofractionated RT in selected patients \nwho are not candidates for combination chemotherapy \n• RT Dosing/Planning:\n\u0017For chemoradiation, RT dose generally consists of 45–56 Gy in 1.8–2.2 Gy \nfractions. \n\u0017There are limited data to support a specific RT dosing for SBRT24; \ntherefore, it should preferably be utilized as part of a clinical trial or at an \nexperienced, high-volume center. SBRT doses of 3 fractions (total dose \n30–45 Gy) or 5 fractions (total dose 25–50 Gy) have been reported.25 More \nprotracted courses delivering high doses through a hypofractionated \napproach (67.5 Gy in 15 fractions or 75 Gy in 25 fractions) are also \nacceptable.26 However, caution is warranted when utilizing higher doses \nand normal tissue constraints must be respected.22 This approach is \noptimally performed in the setting of a clinical trial.\nc SBRT should be delivered at an experienced, high-volume center with technology that allows for image-guided RT or in a clinical trial.24,25 \nFurthermore, since patients with locally advanced disease are less likely to undergo surgery, every effort should be made to limit dose to the \nduodenum and stomach in order to limit treatment-related toxicity.\nd SBRT should be avoided if direct invasion of the bowel or stomach is observed on CT, MRI, and/or endoscopy.Recurrent Pancreatic Cancer (pancreatic bed) :\n• Data are limited to support specific RT recommendations for \nlocally recurrent pancreatic cancer; the options for patients \nwith recurrent, unresectable disease may include:\n\u0017Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation or \nSBRT (if not previously performed) ( Principles of Systemic \nTherapy [PANC-F])\n\u0017Chemoradiation17 or SBRTc,d in selected patients who are \nnot candidates for induction chemotherapy\n• RT Dosing/Planning:\n\u0017For chemoradiation, RT dose generally consists of 45–56 Gy \nin 1.8–2.2 Gy fractions. \n\u0017There are limited data to support a specific RT dosing for \nSBRT; therefore, it should preferably be utilized as part of \na clinical trial or at an experienced, high-volume center. \nSBRT doses of 3 fractions (total dose 30–45 Gy) or 5 \nfractions (total dose 25–50 Gy) have been reported as having \nmore protracted courses delivering high doses through a \nhypofractionated approach. \n\u0017However, caution is warranted when utilizing higher doses \nand normal tissue constraints must be respected.22 This \napproach is optimally performed in the setting of a clinical \ntrial.\nContinued\nReferences on PANC-G 6 of 6PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

See Principles of Palliation and Supportive Care (PANC-H) .\n\u0017Non-Metastatic Disease: Palliative RT can be considered for patients who are older and/or not candidates for definitive therapy due to poor \nPS or comorbidities.\n\u0017Metastatic Disease:\n ◊Metastatic sites causing pain (ie, osseous) may be palliated with a short course of RT.\n ◊RT is reasonable for patients with metastatic disease who require local palliation for symptoms such as obstruction, pain refractory to \nanalgesic therapy, or bleeding.27\n• RT Dosing/Planning:\n\u0017Palliative RT is commonly used, although specific dose and fractionation recommendations should take into account burden of metastatic \ndisease, normal tissue tolerance, and expected survival. \ne Adapted from RTOG 1102 (IMRT, 2.2–54 Gy).\nf Adapted from RTOG 0848 (3D or IMRT).Table 1: Normal Tissue Dose Volume Recommendations for Chemoradiation Utilizing Conventional Fractionation\nOrgan at Risk \n(OAR)Neoadjuvant/Definitive/Palliative and \nRecurrent Recommendationse Adjuvant Recommendationsf\nKidney \n(right and left)Not more than 30% of the total volume \ncan receive ≥18 Gy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-2 Overview  \nIn 2023 , an estimated  64,050  people were  diagnosed with pancreatic \ncancer, and approximately  50,550  people died from the disease  in the \nUnited States .1 Pancreatic cancer  is the fourth leading  cause of \ncancer -related death  in the United States .1 In large population stud ies, \npancreatic cancer incidence increased at a greater rate in Black women \ncompared to any other group over almost two decades beginning in  1999 ; \nhowever, pancreatic cancer -related mortality remained unchanged .2,3  \nIn the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology ( NCCN Guideline s®) \nfor Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, the diagnosis and management  of \nadenocarcinomas of the exocrine pancreas are discussed; \nneuroendocrine tumors are not included (please see the NCCN Guidelines \nfor Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors, available at www.NCCN.org ). \nThese NCCN  Guidelines are intended to assist with clinical \ndecision -making,  but they cannot incorporate all possible clinical variations \nand are not intended to replace good clinical judgment or individualization \nof treatments. Exceptions to the rule were discussed among the Panel \nmembers during the process of developing  and updating  these guidelines. \nA 5% rule (omitting clinical scenarios that comprise <5% of all cases) was \nused as a cut -off to exclude  rare clinical occurrences or conditions from \nthese guidelines.   \nAs an overall guiding principle of these guidelines, the Panel believes that \ndecisions about diagnostic management and resectability of pancreatic \ncancer should involve multidisciplinary consultation at high -volume centers \nusing appropriate imaging studies. In addition, the Panel believes that \nincreasing participation in clinical trials is critical to making  progress in \ndisease  outcomes . Thus, the Panel unanimously endorses participation in \nclinical trial s over standard or accepted therapy.  Guidelines Update Methodology   \nComplete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines® are available at www.NCCN.org . \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic \nAdenocarcinoma , an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed  to obtain key literature in the field of pancreatic cancer using \nthe following search terms: “pancreatic cancer” OR “pancreatic ductal \nadenocarcinoma” OR “PDAC” OR “ampullary cancer” OR “ampullary \nadenocarcinoma .” The PubMed database was chosen because  it remains \nthe most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes  \npeer-reviewed biomed ical literature.4  \nThe search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types:  \nClinical Trial,  Phase I II; Clinical Trial , Phase IV;  Practice Guideline ; \nGuidelines; Randomized Controlled Trial ; Meta -Analysis ; Systematic \nReviews ; and Validation Studies.  \nData from key PubMed articles and additional sources deemed as \nrelevant to these guidelines by the Panel during the Guidelines update \nmeeting have been included in this Discussion section. \nRecommendations for which high -level evidence is lacking are based on \nthe Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.5 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person -first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and \ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  \nNCCN Guidelines incorporate non -gendered language, instead focusing \non organ -specific recommendations.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-3 and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organ izations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent , the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nongoing studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.   \nRisk Factors  \nSmoking  \nAlthough the increase in risk is small, pancreatic cancer is firmly linked to \ncigarette smoking .6-12 Exposure to chemicals  and heavy metals  such as \nbeta-naphthylamine , benzidine , pesticides, asbestos, benzene, and \nchlorinated hydrocarbons  is associated with increased risk  for pancreatic \ncancer,13 as is heavy alcohol consumption.6,8,14 -16 Periodontal disease is \nassociated with pancreatic cancer, even when controlling for other risk \nfactors such as gender, smoking, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, and \nalcohol consumption.17 \nBMI \nElevated  BMI is associated with an increased risk for pancreatic \ncancer,14,18 -20 with higher BMI during early adulthood associated with \nincreased pancreatic cancer mortality.21 A meta -analysis including 22 \ncohort studies of 8,091 patients with pancreatic cancer showed that those \nwho engage in low levels of physical activity have an higher risk for \npancreatic cancer, relative to those who engage in high levels of physical \nactivity (relative risk [RR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.88 –0.98).22 \nAdditionally , there is some evidence that increased consumption of red/processed meat and dairy products is associated with an elevat ed \npancreatic cancer risk,23,24 although other studies have not identif ied \ndietary risk factors  for the disease.10,25,26  \nVitamin D  \nStudies examining the association between vitamin D and risk for \npancreatic cancer show contradictory results. Some data suggest that low \nplasma 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels may increase the risk for pancreatic \ncancer.27 A pooled analysis of nine case -control studies, including 2963 \npatients with pancreatic cancer and 8 ,527 control subjects, showed a \npositive association between vitamin D intake and pancreatic cancer risk \n(odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07 –1.19; P < .001).28 This association \nmay be stronger in those with low retinol/vitamin A intake.  \nChronic Pancreatitis  \nChronic pancreatitis has been identified as a risk factor for pancreatic \ncancer ,29-32 with one study demonstrating a 7.2 -fold increased risk for \npancreatic cancer for patients with a history of pancreatitis.33 A \nmeta -analysis including two case -control studies and one cohort study \n(1,636 patients with pancreatic cancer) showed that hepatitis B infection is \nassociated with pancreatic cancer (OR,  1.50; 95% CI, 1.21 –1.87).34 \nPatients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be at an  increased \nrisk for pancreatic cancer . In a meta -analysis of 11 cohort studies, patients \nwith SLE were found to be an increased risk for developing pancreatic \ncancer (CI , 1.32–1.53; hazard ratio [ HR], 1.43).35 However , further \nepidemiologic studies involving careful evaluation of these possible risk \nfactors with adjustments for potential confounders are needed to clarify \ntheir impact on pancreatic cancer risk.  \nDiabetes  \nThe association between diabetes  mellitus and pancreatic cancer is \nparticularly complicated.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-4 diabetes found that approximately 1% of patients diagnosed with diabetes \nwho are aged <50 years  will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within 3 \nyears .36 Prediabetes may also be associated with increased risk for \npancreatic cancer.37 A systematic review and dose -response \nmeta -analysis including nine prospective studies ( N = 2,408) showed that \nevery 0.56 mmol/L increase in fasting blood glucose is associated with a \n14% increase in pancreatic cancer incidence.38 \nNumerous studies have shown an association between new -onset \nnon-insulin –dependent diabetes and the development of pancreatic \ncancer .36,39,40 Data from a meta -analysis of >38,000 patients show that \nthose with pancreatic cancer and diabetes have a significantly lower \noverall survival ( OS) than those without diabetes  (14.4 vs . 21.7 months; P \n< .001).40 A similar result was seen in a prospective study, in which the \nsurvival of 504 patients with and without diabetes who developed \npancreatic cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) \nCancer Screening Trial  was compared.41 After  multivariable  adjust ment, \nmortality was significantly higher in  participants with diabetes compared to \nthose without (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.14 –2.04; P < .01). In acute -onset \ncases of diabetes prior to pancreatic cancer diagnoses, diabetes is \nthought to be induced by the cancer .42 However, the physiologic basis for \nthis effect is not yet completely understood.   \nLong -term diabetes, on the other hand, appears to be a risk factor for \npancreatic cancer, as some studies have shown  an association of \npancreatic cancer with diabetes of 2 - to 8-year duration.43 However, \ncertain risk factors such as obesity, associated with both diabetes and \npancreatic cancer, may confound these analyses.44 A meta -analysis \nincluding 44 studies showed that the strength of the association between \ndiabetes and pancreatic cancer risk decreases with duration of diabetes, \npotentially due to the effects of long -term diabetes treatment.45 The use of diabetic medications such as insulin and sulfonylureas  is \nassociated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer.46-48 However, \nmetformin may be associated with a reduced risk for pancreatic and other \ncancers,46-51 though a retrospective cohort study ( N = 980) showed that \nmetformin did not significantly improve survival in diabetic patients \ndiagnosed with pancreatic cancer.52 Another retrospective , single -\ninstitution  study showed that in  302 patients with pancreatic cancer and \ndiabetes , metformin use was associated with increased survival at 2 years \n(30.1% vs. 15.4%; P = .004) and i ncreased OS (15.2 months vs. 11.1  \nmonths ; P = .009).53 The OS difference was significant only in patients \nwithout distant metastases and remained significant when insulin users \nwere excluded .  \nGenetic Predisposition  \nThe Panel recommends germline testing in any patient with confirmed \npancreatic cancer and in those in whom there is a clinical suspicion for \ninherited susceptibility  (see the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial \nHigh-Risk Assessment : Breast , Ovarian , and Pancreatic available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). Patients with pancreatic cancer for whom a hereditary \ncancer syndrome is suspect ed should be considered for genetic \ncounseling.54 The Panel emphasizes the importance of taking a thorough \nfamily history when seeing a new patient with pancreatic cancer. In \nparticular, a family history of pancreatitis, melanoma, and cancers of the \npancreas, colorectum, breast, and ovaries should be noted. The Panel \nrecommends using comprehensive gene panel s for hereditary cancer \nsyndromes to test for inherited mutations for any patient with confirmed \npancreatic cancer. A free online  pancreatic cancer risk prediction tool, \ncalled PancPRO , is available an d may help determine risk.55 Referral to \ngenetic counseling may be considered for patients diagnosed with \npancreatic cancer, especially those who have a family history of cancer or \nwho are young, as well as those of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-5 mutation ( ATM , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDKN2A , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , \nPMS2 , STK11 , and TP53 ) or for patients with a positive family history of \ncancer, especially pancreatic cancer, regardless of mutation status. The \nPanel currently does not identify a specific age to define early -onset \npancreatic cancer, though age 50 has been used in previous studies of \nfamilial pancreatic cancer.56 If a cancer syndrome is identified, relatives at \nrisk for disease should be offered genetic counseling. Individuals with a \nsuspicious family history should be advised on risk -reducing strategies \nincluding smoking cessation and weight loss , regardless of whether  they \nhave a known syndrome . In addition, the possibility of screening for \npancreatic and other cancers should be discussed.  For patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic disease who are candidates for anticancer \ntherapy, the NCCN Panel recommends testing for actionable somatic \nmutations, including but not limited to: fusions ( ALK, NRG1, NTRK, ROS1 , \nFGFR2, and RET), mutations ( BRAF, BRCA1/2, HER2, KRAS, and \nPALB2 ), amplifications ( HER2 ), microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch \nrepair deficiency (dMMR), or tumor mutational burden (TMB) . These \nshould be tested  via an FDA -approved and/or validated next -generation \nsequencing ( NGS) -based assay. RNA sequencing assays are preferred \nfor detecting  RNA fusions , because gene fusions are better detected by \nRNA -based NGS.  The Panel also recommends testing for HER2 \noverexpression via immunohistochemistry ( IHC). \nPremalignant Tumors of the Pancreas  \nMucinous cystic neoplasm s (MCNs) and intraductal papillary mucinous \nneoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are cystic lesions that can be small \nand asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally . MCNs have an \novarian -like stroma57,58 and IPMNs can occur in the main duct and/or in \nthe branch ducts. L esions involving the main duct have a higher malignant \npotential  than those in the branches, with the risk of malignancy being \naround 62%.59 The risk of malignancy in MCNs is <15%.59 An international group of experts has established guidelines for the \nmanagement of pancreatic IPMNs and MCNs,60 as has a European \ngroup.61 The international group strongly recommends resection in fit \npatients with main -duct IPMNs  ≥10 mm .59 For branch -duct IPMNs, \nsurveillance is considered an appropriate option in patients who are older \nor ineligible  for resection or for cysts lacking  high-risk stigmata . Branch -\nduct IPMNs  that have an enhancing mural nodule ≥5 mm , or are in the \nhead of the pancreas causing obstructive jaundice should be considered \nfor resection  in patients who can undergo surgery.59,60 Patients with \nresected IPMNs are followed with imaging st udies to identify \nrecurrences.  For MCNs, the international group recommends resection \nfor all patients  who can undergo surgery .59 The European group gives \nsimilar recommendations.61 For appropriate management, refer to the \nmost recent available guideline recommendations.  \nPancreatic Cancer Risk Assessment, Management, and \nScre ening  \nRefer to the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High -Risk \nAssessment : Breast , Ovarian , and Pancreatic , available at \nwww.NCCN.org . \nDiagnosis and Staging  \nDuctal adenocarcinoma and its variants account for >90% of pancreatic \nmalignancies. Symptoms can include weight loss, jaundice, floating stools, \npain, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally pancreatitis; however, \nno early warning signs of pancreatic cancer have been established. Given \nthe association with diabetes (discussed above),  a pancreatic ca ncer \ndiagnosis  should be considered in diabetic patients with unusual \nmanifestations, such as abdominal symptoms and continuous weight loss.  \nUnlike many other cancers, imaging is the primary means through which \npancreatic cancer stage is determined.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-6 resection with curative intent and those with unresectable disease. The \ncriteria for defining resectable disease favor specificity over sensitivity to \navoid denying surgery to patients with a potentially resectable tumor.62 All \npatients for whom there is clinical suspicion of pancreatic cancer or \nevidence of a dilated duct (stricture) should therefore undergo initial \nevaluation by CT  or MRI  performed according to a dedicated pancreas \nprotocol of the abdomen.63 The Panel also recommends imaging after \nneoadjuvant treatment to provide adequate staging and assessment of \nresectability status. Subsequent decisions regarding diagnostic \nmanagement and resectability should involve multidisciplinary consultation  \nand use appropriate studies to evaluate the extent of disease. The Panel \nrecommends that a multidisciplinary review ideally involves  expertise from \nsurgery, diagnostic imaging, interventional endoscopy, medical oncology, \nradiation oncology, pathology, geriatric medicine, genetic counseling, and \npalliative care.  \nThe AJCC has developed staging criteria for adenocarcinoma of the \npancreas that follow the tumor , node , metastasis (TNM) system.64,65 The \nTNM staging criteria for pancreatic cancer in the 7th edition of the AJCC \nCancer Staging Manual account ed for  CT or MRI imaging that determine d \nresectability status  of pancreatic tumors . These staging criteria also \ninclude d information determined only through postsurgical pathologic \nevaluation of resected tumor.65,66 In the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer \nStaging Manual, the definition of N category was revised; N1 was defined \nas 1–3 metastatic lymph nodes and N2 as >4 metastatic lymph nodes. \nAdditionally, the T category ha d a size -based definition and the T4 \ncategory no longer incorporate d resectability.67 Validation studies of \nchanges to the 8th edition of the AJCC T and N staging found that it better \nstratifies patients with resected tumors according to their lymph node \ninvolvement68 and retains prognostic accuracy,69 compared to the 7th \nedition. Refer to the most recent edition  of AJCC Cancer Staging Manual \nfor updated  staging information.  For clinical purposes, however , most NCCN Member Institutions  use a \nclinical classification system based mainly on results of presurgical \nimaging studies. For individuals with no evidence of metastatic disease, \nthe Panel recommends chest and pelvis CT (and endoscopic ultrasound \n[EUS], and/or MRI if clinically indicated for indeterminate liver lesions, \nand/or PET/ CT or MRI  for patients with high  risk to detect extra -pancreatic \nmetastases), or e ndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) \nto place a stent if jaundiced or undiagnosed on previous placement (or \npercutaneous transhepatic cholangiography [PTC]) in some cases), liver \nfunction tests and baseline CA 19 -9 in a decompressed patient, genetic \ncounseling , and germline testing . For patients with confirmed tumors  on \nimaging , disease  is classified as: 1) resectable ; 2) borderline resectable  \n(ie, tumors that are involved with nearby structures so as to be neither \nclearly resectable nor clearly unresectable with a high chance of a n R1 \nresection ); 3) locally advanced  (ie, tumors that are involved with nearby \nstructures to an extent that renders them unresectable despite the \nabsence of evidence of metastatic disease) ; 4) unresectable at surgery; or \n5) metastatic , and this classification  is used through out the guidelines.  For \npatients with evidence of metastatic disease,  the Panel recommends a \nbiopsy confirmation from preferably a metastatic site followed by genetic \ntesting for inherited mutations, molecular profiling of tumor tissues , and \ncomplete staging with chest and pelvis CT.  \nImaging Evaluations  \nPancreatic Protocol CT and MRI  \nMulti -detector CT  (MDCT)  angiography  is the preferred imaging tool for \ndedicated pancreatic imaging. Ideally, MDCT  angiography is performed by \nacquiring thin, preferably sub -millimeter, axial sections using a dual -phase \npancreatic protocol with images obtained in the pancreatic and portal \nvenous phase of contrast enhancement. Scan s can be extended to cover \nthe chest and pelvis for complete staging as per institutional preferences. \nMultiplanar reconstruction is preferred as it allows precise visualization of  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

Due to  the \naggressive  nature  of pancreatic cancer and its ability to rapid ly \nmetasta size, the accuracy of MDCT in determining resectability reduces \nover time .76 Therefore,  high-quality CT imaging should occur no more than \n4 weeks before surgery.76 \nThe difference in contrast enhancement between the parenchyma and \nadenocarcinoma is highest during the pancreatic phase, thereby providing \na clear distinction between a hypodense lesion in the pancreas and the \nrest of the organ. A multi -phasic pancreatic p rotocol also allows for \nenhanced visualization of important arterial (eg, celiac axis, superior \nmesenteric artery [SMA], hepatic artery) and venous structures (eg, \nsuperior mesenteric vein [SMV], splenic vein, portal vein [PV]), thereby \nproviding an assess ment of vascular invasion by the tumor. All this \ninformation can improve the prediction of resectability. Software allowing \nfor 3D reconstruction of imaging data can provide additional valuable \ninformation on the anatomic relationship between the pancreatic tumor \nand the surrounding blood vessels a nd organs. However, further \ndevelopment of this technology may be needed before it is routinely \nintegrated into clinical practice.74  \nPatients commonly present to the oncologist with a non -pancreas protocol \nCT already performed. The Panel recommends performing high -quality \ndedicated imaging of the pancreas even if standard CT imaging is already \navailable. Such reimaging change d the staging and management of \npatients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in 56% of cases at a single  \ninstitution.77 The Panel recommends imaging with contrast , unless \ncontraindicated,  for appropriate disease management. PET/CT scan to detect extra -pancreatic metastases may be considered after formal \npancreatic CT protocol in patients with high -risk. It is not a substitute for \nhigh-quality, contrast -enhanced CT. Pancreas protocol MRI with contrast \ncan be a helpful adjunct to CT in the staging of pancreatic cancer, \nparticularly for characterization of CT -indeterminate liver lesions and when \nsuspected pancreatic tumors are not visible on CT or in cases of contrast \nallergy.78,79  \nA multidisciplinary expert consensus group defined standardized language  \nto report  imaging results.63 Use of the radiology staging reporting template , \nas put together by the consensus group,  is recommended by the Panel. \nThe template includes morphologic, arterial, venous, and extrapancreatic \nevaluations.63 Morphologic evaluation includes documentation of tumor \nappearance, size, and location, as well as the presence of narrowing or \nabrupt cut -off of pancreatic duct or biliary tree. The arterial evaluation \nshould include celiac axis, SMA, and common hepatic artery  assessment . \nArterial variations such as vessel contact, solid soft  tissue contact, hazy \nattenuation or stranding contact, and focal vessel narrowing,  or contour \nirregularity  should also be noted . Venous evaluation should include an \nassessment of the main PV (MPV) and SMV. Appearance of thrombus \nwithin the vein and venous collaterals should also be documented . The \nextrapancreatic evaluation should include documentation of liver lesions, \nperitoneal or omental nodule s, ascites, suspicious lymph nodes, and other \npresent extrapancreatic disease sites.  Such templates  ensure complete \nassessment and reporting of all imaging criteria essential for optimal \nstaging, can help improve the accuracy and consistency of staging to \ndetermine optimal treatment strategies for individual patients , and allow \ncross -study and cross -institutional comparisons for research purposes.  \nEndoscopic Ultrasound  \nNCCN  Member  Institution practice s vary in the use of additional staging \ntechnologies, such as EUS .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-8 pancreatic cancer showed that EUS for T1 –2 staging has a sensitivity and \nspecificity of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively.80 Sensitivity and specificity for \nT3–4 staging is 0.90 and 0.72, respectively.81-84 EUS may be used  to \ndiscriminate between benign and malignant strictures or stenosis, because  \nsevere stenosis and marked proximal dilatation most often indicate \nmalignancy.85 EUS can also be used to evaluate periampullary masses , \nseparating invasive from noninvasive lesions.  EUS plays  a role in better \ncharacterizing cystic pancreatic lesions due to the ability to aspirate the \ncyst contents for cytologic, biochemical, and molecular analysis. On EUS, \nmalignant  cystic lesions may present as a hypoechoic cystic/solid mass or \nas a complex cyst  that are frequently associated with a dilated main \npancreatic duct.  Some therapeutic interventions (eg, celiac neurolysis , \nremoval of ascites ) can also be done with EUS. Because this procedure is  \noperator dependent, some divergence in use may occur because of \ndiffering technical capabilities and available expertise.  \nThe role of EUS in staging is complementary to  pancreas CT protocol  \n(which is considered the gold standard ). The primary role of EUS is to \nprocure tissue for cytologic diagnosis, but sometimes additional diagnostic \ninformation is identified. EUS provid es additional information for patients \nwhose initial  scans show no lesion or who se lesions  have questionable \ninvolvement of blood vessels or lymph nodes .81-84 Because variations in \nhepatic arterial anatomy occur in up to 45% of individuals, and EUS is \nhighly operator dependent, EUS is not recommended as a routine staging \ntool and should not be used to assess vascular involvement . \nEndoscopic R etrograde Cholangiopancreatography and Percutaneous \nTranshepatic Cholangiography  \nERCP  is a technique that combines endoscopic and fluoroscopic \nprocedures and is generally limited to therapeutic interventions.86 ERCP is \na preferred recommendation for p atient s who are jaundiced or diagnosed \non previous biopsy  and without evidence of metastatic disease  who \nrequire biliary decompression and who undergo additional imaging with EUS to help establish a diagnosis .87 Thus, from a therapeutic standpoint \nERCP allows for s tent placement and can be used to palliate biliary \nobstruction when surgery is not elected  or if surgery must be delayed. \nHowever, biliary decompression in those without symptomatic \nhyperbilirubinemia receiving upfront surgery may be avoided.88-90 There \nare occasional anatomic considerations that preclude ERCP stent \nplacement. In these cases, palliation of biliary obstruction can be achieved \nby placing a stent through the liver using PTC.91 \nPET/CT  \nThe utility of PET/CT for upstaging patients with pancreatic cancer has \nbeen evaluated. In a retrospective study, the use of PET/CT following  a \nstandard CT protocol showed  increased sensitivity for detection of \nmetastatic disease when compared with the standard CT protocol or \nPET/CT alone.92 The sensitivity of detecting metastatic disease for \nPET/CT alone, standard CT alone, and the combination of PET/CT and \nstandard CT were 61%, 57%, and 87%, respectively. In this study, the \nclinical management of 11% of patients with invasive pancreatic can cer \nchanged because of  PET/CT findings. Nevertheless, the role of PET/CT in \nthis setting is evolving and has not yet been established.93,94 PET/CT is \nnot a substitute for high -quality contrast -enhanced CT, although it can be \nconsidered as an adjunct to a formal pancreatic CT protocol in patients  \nwith high  risk. Indicators of high  risk for metastatic disease may include  \nequivocal or indeterminate imaging findings , markedly elevated CA 19 -9, \nlarge primary tumors, large regional lymph nodes , excessive weight loss, \nand extreme pain . In the neoadjuvant setting , PET/CT scan can be \nconsidered , before and after therapy initiation , to assess response to \nsystemic therapy and for restaging . \nLaparoscopy  \nLaparoscopy is another potentially valuable diagnostic tool for staging; it \ncan identify peritoneal , capsular, or serosal implants or studding of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-9 metastatic tumor on the liver  that may be missed  even with the use of  a \npancreatic CT protocol.95-97 The yield of laparoscopy is dependent on the \nquality of preoperative imaging and the lik elihood of metastatic disease. A \nkey goal is to avoid unnecessary laparotomy,  which can be accomplished \nin an estimated 23% of patients in whom curative intent surgery is \nplanned,96 although routine use of staging laparoscopy is controversial . \nThere is some concern that laparoscopy may promote trocar -site \nrecurrences and peritoneal disease progression, but these concerns are \nbased on clinical observation and experimental data from animal and in \nvitro studies, and one retrospective study ( N = 235) that found  no \nsignificant association between  staging laparoscopy  and poor outcomes.98 \nThe Panel does not consider staging laparoscopy to be a substitute for \npoor-quality preoperative imaging.  \nThere is s ome evidence for a selective approach to staging laparoscopy \n(ie, it is performed if occult metastatic disease is suggested by high -quality \nimaging or certain clinical indicators).99 For example, preoperative serum \nCA 19 -9 levels >100 U/mL or >215 U/mL are associated with a greater \nlikelihood of advanced disease and an increased probability of a positive \nfinding on staging laparoscopy.100,101 In a prospective review of 838 \npatients diagnosed with resectable pancreatic tumors via imaging \nevaluation between 1999 and 2005, 14% were found to have unresectable \ndisease (21% if only pancreatic adenocarcinoma was considered) \nfollowing subsequent laparoscopy.102 Characteristics associated with \nincreased laparoscopic yield of unresectable disease include the location \nof the tumor, tumor histology, the presence of weight loss and jaundice, \nand the facility conducting the imaging evaluation.  \nDiagnostic staging laparoscopy to rule out metastases not detected on \nimaging (especially for patients with body and tail lesions) is used routinely \nat some NCCN Member Institutions prior to surgery or chemoradiation, or \nselectively in patients who are at higher risk for disseminated disease (ie, equivocal or indeterminate imaging findings; markedly elevated CA 19 -9; \nlarge primary tumors; large regional lymph nodes ; highly symptomatic; \nexcessive weight loss  and extreme pain).  Thus, the Panel believes that \nstaging laparoscopy can be considered for patients staged with resectable \npancreatic cancer with an  increased risk for disseminated disease and for \npatients with borderline resectable disease prior  to and after  administration \nof neoadjuvant therapy.  Intraoperative ultrasound may be used as a \ndiagnostic adjunct during staging laparoscopy to further evaluate liver and \ntumor and vascular involvement. The Panel considers positive cytology \nfrom washings obtained at laparoscopy or laparotomy to be equivalent to \nM1 disease.103 \nBiopsy  \nAlthough a pathologic diagnosis is not required before surgery, it is \nnecessary before administration of neoadjuvant therapy  and for patients \nwith locally advanced pancreatic cancer , borderline resectable  disease , or \nmetastatic disease. A pathologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the \npancreas is often made using fine -needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy with \nEUS guidance  (preferred) . When EUS -guided biopsy is not feasible, a CT -\nguided biopsy can be performed . EUS-FNA is preferable to CT -guided \nFNA in patients wit h resectable disease because of better diagnostic yield, \nsafety, and potentially lower risk of peritoneal seeding .104-106 Additional \nrisks of CT -directed FNA biopsy include the potential for greater bleeding \nand infection because of the need to traverse vessels and bowel. \nEUS-FNA also gives the benefit of additional staging information at the \ntime of biopsy.  \nEUS-FNA is highly accurate and reliable for determining malignancy . A \nmeta -analysis including 20 studies and 2761 patients showed sensitivity \nand specificity values of 90.8% and 96.5%, respectively, for diagnosis of \nsolid pancreatic lesions.107 In rare cases when EUS -FNA cannot be \nobtained from a patient with borderline resectable or unresectable PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-10 disease, other acceptable methods of biopsy exist. For instance, \nintraductal biopsies can be obtained via endoscopic cholangioscopy.108 A \npercutaneous approach105 or a laparoscopic biopsy109 are other \nalternatives.  Pancreatic ductal brushings or biopsies can also be obtained \nat the time of ERCP, which often reveal malignant cytology consistent with \npancreatic adenocarcinoma.  \nIf a biopsy does not confirm malignancy, at least one repeat biopsy should \nbe performed;  EUS-guided FNA and a core needle biopsy at a \nhigh-volume center is preferred . New methods are being developed for \ndiagnosis of pancreatobiliary malignancies (eg, cholangiopancreatoscopy) \nwhen repeat biopsy is needed.110 When cancer is not confirmed after two \nor three biopsies in patients with borderline resectable disease , the Panel \nrecommends referral to a high -volume center for further evaluation. Core \nneedle biopsy is recommended, if possible, for all patients with locally \nadvanced  or metastatic or recurrent disease to obtain adequate tissue for \npotential ancillary studies, including tumor/somatic  molecular profiling . \nAlternative diagnoses including autoimmune pancreatitis should be \nconsidered. A positive biopsy is req uired before administration of \nchemotherapy. However, i t is important to reiterate that biopsy proof of \nmalignancy is not required before surgical resection  for clearly resectable \nor borderline resectable disease  and that a nondiagnostic biopsy should \nnot delay surgical resection when the clinical suspicion  for pancreatic \ncancer is high. The NCCN Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Panel  strongly \nrecommends that all diagnostic and surgical management decisions \ninvolve multidisciplinary consultation.  \nEvolving changes in molecular analyses of pancreatic cancer have led \nsome institutions to attempt to procure additional tumor -rich, \nformalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tissue to bank for future genomic \nstudies.  Several methods can be used to obtain such tissue samples, \nincluding core biopsy, but the Panel believes that core biopsies should not replace EUS -guided FNA, but rather can be performed  in addition to \nEUS-guided FNA.   \nBiomarkers  \nAssociation of m any tumor -associated antigens , including \ncarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), pancreatic anti -oncofetal antigen, \ntissue polypeptide antigen, CA 125, a nd CA 19 -9, with pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma have been investigated . The Panel recognizes the \nimportance of identifying biomarkers for early detection of  this difficult  \ndisease, and they emphasize the need for collection and sharing of \ntissue to help accelerate the discovery of prognostic biomarkers. For \nexample, a meta -analysis of eight studies found  that S100 \ncalcium -binding protein P (S100P) shows high sensitivity (0.87; 95% CI, \n0.83–0.90) and specificity (0.88; 95% CI, 0.82 –0.93) for pancreatic \ncancer  diagnosis .111 A biomarker panel consisting of the immunoassays \nTIMP1 and LRG1, along with CA 19 -9 improved the detection of \nearly -stage pancreatic cancer, relative to CA 19 -9 alone.112 \nCA 19-9 \nThe best-validated and most clinical ly useful biomarker  for early detection \nand surveillance of pancreatic cancer  is CA 19 -9, a sialylated Lewis A \nblood group antigen . CA 19 -9 is commonly expressed and shed in \npancreatic and hepatobiliary disease and other  malignancies; thus, it is not \ntumor -specific.  However, the degree of increase in CA 19 -9 levels may be \nuseful in differentiating adenocarcinoma from inflammatory conditions of \nthe pancreas .113 CA 19 -9 has potential uses in  diagnos is, screening , \nstaging, determining resectability , as a prognostic marker after  resection , \nand as a predictive marker for  response to chemotherapy .114 \nCA 19 -9 is a good diagnostic marker, with sensitivity of 79% to 81% and \nspecificity of 80% to 90% in symptomatic patients,115 but its low positive \npredictive value makes it a poor biomarker for screening.114 Preoperative PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-11 CA 19 -9 levels correlate with both AJCC staging and resectability and thus \ncan provide additional information for staging and determining \nresectability, along with information from imaging, laparoscopy, and \nbiopsy.116-118 \nCA 19 -9 also seems to have value as a prognostic and a predictive marker \nfor pancreatic cancer in various settings. In resectable disease, for \ninstance, low postoperative serum CA 19 -9 levels or a serial decrease in \nCA 19 -9 levels following surgery is prognostic for  survival in patients \nundergoing resection.114,116,118 -124 In a prospective study of patients \nundergoing surgery with curative intent, median survival for the group of \npatients with post-resection  CA 19 -9 levels of <180 U/mL was significantly \nhigher compared with the group with higher levels of CA 19 -9 following \nsurgery (HR, 3.53; P < .0001).120  \nAnalysis of 260 patients also support s the role of postoperative CA 19 -9 \nlevels  in predicting the benefit of adjuvant therapy  after resection .123 \nPatients with CA 19 -9 levels of <90 U/mL  who received  adjuvant therapy \n(mostly gemcitabine -based) had a longer disease -free survival (DFS) than \nthose who did not receive gemcitabine -based adjuvant therapy (26.0 \nmonths vs. 16.7 months; P = .011). In contrast, patients with CA 19 -9 \nlevels of >90 u/mL did not appear to significantly benefit from adjuvant \ntherapy, with DFS of 16.2 months and 9.0 months for those receiving \nversus not receiving adjuvant therapy, respectively ( P = .719). In this \nsame study, the 1 1 patients with post -adjuvant therapy CA 19 -9 levels <37 \nU/mL had the best outcome , while the 8 patients with > 37 U/mL CA 19 -9 \nlevels had a median DFS of 19.6 months.  \nIn the neoadjuvant/borderline resectable setting, a study of 141 patients \nfound that post -treatment CA 19 -9 level w as a good prognostic marker in \nthose receiving neoadjuvant therapy with or without subsequent \nresection.125 In this study , reduction  of CA 19 -9 to <40 U/mL was \nassociated with OS improvements in patients with non-resected (15 months vs. 11 months; P = .02) and resected ( 37.9 months vs. 26 months; \nP = .02) disease . \nThere are data to support the role of CA 19 -9 as a prognostic marker  in \nadvanced disease .119,126,127 In a prospective study of patients with \nadvanced pancreatic cancer, pretreatment CA 19 -9 serum levels were \nshown to be an independent prognostic factor for survival.126 In addition, \nchange in CA 19 -9 levels during chemotherapy in patients with advanced \ndisease can be useful for evaluating the benefit of treatment, although the \ndata are not entirely consistent .126-130 For example, a study that pooled \nindividual patient data from 6 prospective trials found that a decline in CA \n19-9 levels from baseline to after surgery and two rounds of adjuvant \ntherapy were associated with better outcome s.119 In fact, increases of <5% \nin CA 19 -9 were associated with improved OS compared to patients with a \n>5% increase  (10.3 months vs. 5.1 months; P = .002).  \nIt is important to note that CA 19 -9 may be undetectable in Lewis \nantigen -negative individuals.131 Furthermore, CA 19 -9 may be falsely \nelevated in cases of biliary infection (cholangitis), inflammation, or  biliary \nobstruction (regardless of etiology)  and does not  necessarily indicate \ncancer or advanced disease .132,133 Measurement of CA  19-9 levels  \n(category 3)  is therefore best performed after biliary decompressio n is \ncomplete,  and bilirubin is normal. If biliary decompression is not performed \nin a patient with jaundice, CA 19 -9 levels can be assessed (category 3), \nbut they do not represent an accurate baseline.   \nThe Panel recommends measur ing serum CA 19 -9 levels after \nneoadjuvant treatment, prior to surgery, following surgery immediately \nprior to administration of adjuvant therapy, and for surveillance (category \n2B). The Panel emphasizes the importance of obtaining a CA 19 -9 \nmeasurement immediately before therapeutic intervention to get an \naccurate baseline from which to follow response , for example , before and \nafter neoadjuvant therapy in patients with borderline resectable  tumors .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-12 The Panel recognizes that  different commercial methods are available for \nquantifying this tumor -associated antigen. Measurements of serum levels \nof CA 19 -9 using one testing method cannot be extrapolated to levels \nobtained using a different procedure.  \nDifferential  Diagnoses  \nChronic pancreatitis and other benign conditions are possible differential \ndiagnos es of patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer .134-138 \nAutoimmune  pancreatitis, a rare form of chronic pancreatitis  also known \nas lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis , is a heterogeneous disease \nthat can present with clinical and radiologic characteristics of pancreatic \ncancer, such as jaundice, weight loss, elevated CA 19 -9 level, and the \npresence of diffuse pancreatic enlargement, a pancreatic ductal stricture , \nor a focal pancreatic  mass.136,139,140 The classic appearance of the \npancreas on abdominal CT in patients with diffuse pancreatic involvement \nis a sausage -shaped enlargement of the organ with a capsule -like \nperipheral rim surrounding the pancreas, although focal enlargement of \nthe pancreas is observed in some cases.140 Cardinal histologic features of \nautoimmune pancreatitis include prominent lymphocytic infiltration of the \npancreatic parenchyma with associated fibrosis. Fine-needle aspirates can \nalso be misinterpreted as malignant or suspicious malignancies.141 As a \nbenign disease that can be effectively treated with corticosteroids, \nautoimmune pancreatitis must be distinguished from pancreatic cancer to \navoid unnecessary surgery and prevent delay in the initiation of \nappropriate treatment.141-143 \nIncreased serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels are supportive of a \ndiagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis, although elevated serum levels \nIgG4 are the most sensitive and specific laboratory indicator.144 IgG4 \nlevels of >1.0 g/L combined with CA 19 -9 levels of <74 U/mL distinguished \npatients with autoimmune pancreatitis from those with adenocarcinoma \nwith 94% sensitivity and 100% specificity .145 Autoimmune pancreatitis can, however, be negative for IgG4  when there is a large pancreatic mass , thus \nclosely mimicking pancreatic adenocarcinoma .   \nSystemic Therapy Approaches  for Locally Advanced or \nMetastatic Disease  \nData supporting the regimens recommended in the guidelines for treating \npatients with pancreatic cancer are described below.  \nFOLFIRINOX  and Modified FOLFIRINOX  \nA systematic review including 11 studies (N = 315) of patients with locally \nadvanced pancreatic cancer treated with fluorouracil ( 5-FU)/leucovorin \nplus oxaliplatin and irinotecan ( FOLFIRINOX ) showed a pooled median \nOS of 24.2 months (95% CI, 21.7 –26.8).146 An observational study of 101 \npatients with locally advanced unresectable disease who were treated with \nFOLFIRINOX as induction therapy showed that 29% of patients  (20% \nwithout administration of chemoradiation) had a reduction in tumor size of \n>30%, and half of the se patients underwent resection.147 Out of the \npatients who underwent resection, 55% achieved an R0 resection.  \nIn 2003, a French group reported the results from an open phase I study \nto assess the feasibility of FOLFIRINOX for the treatment of patients with \nmetastatic solid tumors.148 Their study included 6 patients with pancreatic \ncancer , of which two patients showed response (complete and partial) to \nFOLFIRINOX . A subsequent multicenter phase II trial specifically for \npatients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma  demonstrated \npromising response rates.149 This was followed by a randomized phase II \ntrial that showed a response rate of >30% to FOLFIRINOX in patients with \nmetastatic pancreatic cancer.150 The larger randomized phase III trial \nevaluating FOLFIRINOX versus  gemcitabine in patients with metastatic \npancreatic cancer and good performance status (PS) showed dramatic \nimprovements in both median  progression -free survival ( PFS) (6.4 months \nvs. 3.3 months; P < .001) and median OS (11.1 months vs. 6.8 months; P PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

It is listed as a category 2A \nrecommendation for patients with locally advanced disease by \nextrapolation. The Panel also recommends  this regimen as an acceptable \noption in the neoadjuvant/borderline resectable setting.   \nThere are some concerns about the toxicity of the FOLFIRINOX regimen . \nIn the phase III trial, some of the grade 3/4 toxicity rates , 45.7% for \nneutropenia, 12.7% for diarrhea, 9.1% for thrombocytopenia, and 9.0% for \nsensory neuropathy,  were significantly greater in the FOLFIRINOX group \nthan in the gemcitabine group.151 Despite this toxicity, fewer patients in the \nFOLFIRINOX group experienced a degradation in their quality of life  \n(QOL)  at 6 months compared to those in the gemcitabine group (31% vs. \n66%, P < .01).151 A more detailed analysis of patients in this trial was \npublished and showed that FOLFIRINOX maintained  and even improve d \nQOL  more  so than gemcitabine .154 No toxic ity-associated  deaths were  \nreported  with this regimen .149-151 \nThe Panel recognizes the various approaches to manage the toxicity  \nassociated with FOLFIRINOX. For example, first-line FOLFIRINOX at 80% \ndose intensity was associated with good activity and acceptable toxicity  \nwhen administered  with routine growth factor support  in carefully selected \npatients with metastatic or locally advanced disease.155 Median OS was \n12.5 months in the metastatic setting and 13.7 mo nths in patients with \nlocally advanced disease . Another phase II , single -arm, prospective trial (N = 75)  assessed the efficacy and toxicity of a n mFOLFIRINOX regimen \nin which the initial dosing of bolus 5 -FU and irinotecan were each reduced \nby 25%.156 In patients with metastatic disease, the efficacy of the modified \nregimen was comparable to that of the standard regimen (median OS = \n10.2 months). The median OS was 26.6 months  in patients with locally \nadvanced disease . Patients who received the modified regimen \nexperienced significantly less neutropenia, fatigue, and vomiting, relative \nto patients who received the standard FOLFIRINOX regimen  (as reported \nby previous study) . An overall response rate (ORR) of 27% was observed  \nin 22 patients with locally adv anced pancreatic cancer with  a median PFS \nof 11.7 months.157 Five patients (23%) were able to undergo R0 \nresections , although three  of these patients experienced distant \nrecurrence by 5 months.157 Based on these studies, the  Panel \nrecommends FOLFIRINOX or mFOLFIRINOX regimen  as preferred first-\nline treatment options  for patients with good PS and locally \nadvanced/metastatic disease . \nGemcitabine -Based Therapy  \nThe NCCN Panel  acknowledge s that, historically, combination \nchemotherapy does  not appear to be superior to monotherapy in the era of \n5-FU–based therapy. However, because gemcitabine is superior to bolus \n5-FU in the advanced setting  when efficacy endpoints of survival and relief \nfrom symptoms are used, it is often combined with other chemotherapeutic \nagents for patients with good  and intermediate  PS. Gemcitabine has been \ninvestigated in combination with potentially synergistic agents (such as \ncisplatin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, 5 -FU, and irinotecan) or in a multidrug \ncombination ( eg, cisplatin, epirubicin, gemcitabine, 5 -FU).158-170 Two \nmeta -analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the advanced \nsetting found that gemcitabine combinations give a marginal benefit in OS \nover gemcitabine monotherapy with a significant increase in toxicity.171,172 \nOf note, results from several studies have indicated that the benefit of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

In addition, gemcitabine  plus sorafenib  is not recommended. \nThe multi center , double -blind , placebo -controlled, randomized phase III \nBAYPAN trial compar ing gemcitabine  plus either sorafenib or placebo  in \nchemotherapy -naïve patients with advanced or metastatic disease did not \nmeet its primary endpoint of PFS in its 104 patients ( 5.7 months  vs. 3.8 \nmonths; P = .90).175 Gemcitabine -based therapies recommended in the \nguidelines are described below.  \nGemcitabine Plus Albumin -Bound  Paclitaxel  \nAlbumin -bound  paclitaxel is a nanoparticle form of paclitaxel. In a phase \nI/II trial, 67 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer received gemcitabine \nplus albumin -bound  paclitaxel. At the maximum tolerated dose, the partial \nresponse rate was 48%  and 20% of patients demonstrat ed stable disease. \nThe median OS at this dose was 12.2 months.176 \nBased on these results, a large, open -label, international, randomized \nphase III trial was initiated in 861 patients with metastatic pancreatic \ncancer and no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy.177 Participants were \nrandomized to receive gemcitabine plus albumin -bound  paclitaxel or \ngemcitabine alone. The primary endpoint for the trial was OS (8.5 months \nfor gemcitabine plus albumin -bound paclitaxel vs. 6. 7 months  for \ngemcitabine alone ; P < .001; HR, 0.72).177 The addition of albumin -bound  \npaclitaxel also improved other endpoints, including 1 - and 2-year survival, \nresponse rate, and PFS. In a subsequent analysis, early decrease in CA  \n19-9 level in both treatment arms was associated with OS improvement .178 \nThe most common grade 3 or higher adverse events attributable to \nalbumin -bound  paclitaxel were neutropenia, fatigue, and neuropathy. \nDevelopment of peripheral neuropathy was associated with longer treatment duration and improved survival .179 The MPACT trial show ed that \nat least 3% of patients who received the gemcitabine plus albumin -bound \npaclitaxel  arm were alive at 42 months  compared to no patients who \nreceived gemcitabine alone .180 Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS) score \nand absence of liver metastases  were independent prognostic factors for \nOS and PFS.181 \nBased on these results, g emcitabine plus albumin -bound  paclitaxel is a \ncategory 1, preferred recommendation option for the treatment of patients \nwith metastatic disease. The clinical trial s used KPS ≥70 as an eligibility \ncriterion  for gemcitabine plus albumin -bound paclitaxel .177,180,182,183 By \nextrapolation of these data, the Panel recommends this combination in the \nlocally advanced setting for patients with ECOG 0 –2 (category 2A). The \nPanel notes that this combination with or without subsequent \nchemoradiation is an acceptable option in the neoadjuvant  setting for \nresectable /borderline resectable setting.  Additionally, gemcitabine plus \nalbumin -bound paclitaxel is an option (other recommended regimens) for \nsubsequent therapy for locally advanced/metastatic disease and therapy \nfor recurrent dis ease  in patients with ECOG 0 –2. \nGemcitabine Plus Cisplatin  \nData  regarding the impact of combining gemcitabine with a platinum agent  \non survival are conflicting, and results of RCTs  have not provide d support \nfor use of gemcitabine plus cisplatin in the treatment of patients with \nadvanced pancreatic cancer. Phase III trials evaluating the combination of \ngemcitabine with cisplatin versus  gemcitabine alone in patients with \nadvanced pancreatic cancer did not  show a significant survival benefit for \nthe combination over the single agent .159,160,164  \nNevertheless, gemcitabine plus cisplatin has shown benefit in selected \npatients with breast and ovarian cancers who are carriers of a BRCA  \nmutation .184-186 A retrospective  study of patients with metastatic pancreatic \ncancer and a family history of breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancers PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

The Panel recommends gemcitabine plus \ncisplatin for patients with  metastatic or locally advanced disease  or as a \nsubsequent therapy option for patients with ECOG 0 –1 and known \nBRCA1/2  or PALB2  mutations. FOLFIRINOX and modified FOLFIRINOX \nare also possible treatment options for patients with BRCA1/2  and PALB2  \nmutations.  \nGemcitabine Plus Erlotinib and Other Targeted Therapeutics  \nPhase III studies of gemcitabine combinations with other biologic agent s \nshow  that only the combination of gemcitabine plus erlotinib is associated \nwith a statistically significant increase in survival compared to gemcitabine \nalone.189-193 In the  phase III , double -blind, placebo -controlled  NCIC CTG \nPA.3  trial of 569 patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer  \nrandomly assigned to receive  erlotinib (an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine \nkinase) plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone, data showed \nstatistically significant improvements in OS in patients in the erlotinib arm \n(HR, 0.82; P = .038) and PFS (HR, 0.77; P = .004) compared to patients \nreceiving gemcitabine alone.189 Median survival was 6. 24 mon ths and \n1-year survival was 23 %, compared with 5.91 months and 1 7% in the \ncontrol arm . Adverse events, such as rash and diarrhea, were higher in \nthe group receiving erlotinib, but most were grade 1 or 2.189 This and other \ntrials  along with community experience show that occurrence of grade 2 or higher skin rash is associated with better response and OS in patients \nreceiving erlotinib.189,194,195 \nThe NCCN Panel  recommends  the gemcitabine -erlotinib combination \ntherapy as a treatment  option , under other recommended regimens,  for \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic disease  and good  PS. This \ncombination is a category 1 recommendation for patients with metastatic \ndisease  in the first-line setting . The Panel notes that although this \ncombination significantly improved survival, the actual benefit was small, \nsuggesting that only a small subset of patients benefit.  \nGemcitabine Plus Capecitabine  \nA number of randomized trials have investigated the combination of \ngemcitabine with capecitabine, a fluoropyrimidine, in patients with \nadvanced pancreatic cancer. A  randomized study in 533 patients with \nadvanced disease  found that PFS and objective response rates were \nsignificantly improved in patients receiving gemcitabine plus capecitabine \ncompared with gemcitabine alone . Although a trend toward an \nimprovement in OS for the combination arm did not reach statistical \nsignificance , the authors performed a me ta-analysis that included two \nother studies that showed significant survival benefit .161 A smaller phase III \ntrial also did not demonstrate an OS advantage for the overall study \npopulation  receiving the combination of gemcitabine with capecitabine, \nalthough a post -hoc analysis showed significantly increased OS in the \nsubgroup of patients with good PS.166 Despite greater ORR  (43.7% vs. \n17.6%, respectively; P = .001), r esults from a randomized phase III trial \nalso showed that gemcitabine with capecitabine did not significantly \nimprove OS  compared with gemcitabine alone.196 In a meta -analysis of 8 \nRCTs , OS was better in patients receiving gemcitabine plus capecitabine \nthan in patients receiving gemcitabine alone (HR, 0.87; P = .03).197 \nAlthough there are concerns about dosing and toxicity of capecitabine in \nthe U.S population, a biweekly regimen of fixed -dose gemcitabine in PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

In a \nreport of 35 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with this \nregimen, the authors reported an ORR  in 29% of patients and 31% of \npatients exhibit ed a minor response or stable disease.163 The median \nsurvival was 11.2 months  for all patients. This regimen was associated \nwith significant toxicities, however, with 14% of patients having g rade 3 /4 \nleukopenia , 14% having grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia , and 9% having \ngrade 3/4 anemia . A retrospective case -review study found similar results \nwith a median OS of 11.6 months and grade 3 or higher  hematologic and \nnon-hematologic toxicity rates of 41% and 9%, respectively.199 \nGemcitabine combined with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOXEL) was \nassessed in the metastatic setting  in a randomized phase II trial ( N = \n67).200 Disease control rate ( P = .004), PFS ( P < .001), and OS ( P < .001) \nwere all superior in patients randomized to receive the GEMOXEL \nregimen, compared to patients randomized to receive gemcitabine alone.  \nThe NCCN Panel considers gemcitabine -based combination therapy with \ncapecitabine  to be a reasonable first-line option  (category 2A)  for patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic disease and a good PS who are \ninterested in pursuing more aggressive th erapy outside of a clinical trial.  \nGemcitabine + Albumin -Bound Paclitaxel + Cisplatin  \nIn a single -arm phase Ib/II trial of 25 pa tients with untreated advanced \npancreatic cancer, the addition of cisplatin to gemcitabine and albumin -\nbound paclitaxel resulted in an  ORR  of 71% .201 A phase II trial in an \nintention -to-treat (ITT) population of 60 patients with advanced biliary \ntract cancer resulted in a median PFS of 11.8 months and median OS of 19.2 months .202 Based on the se small trials , the Panel recommend this \ncombination as a category 2A (other recommended regimens) , first-line \ntherapy for metastatic disease and extrapolat ing its use as a category 2B \noption for first -line therapy for locally advanced and subsequent therapy . \nGemcitabine and Other Fluoropyrimidine -Based Therapies  \nGemcitabine in combination with other fluoropyrimidine -based therapies  \nhas also been examined . A meta -analysis of eight  RCTs , including more \nthan 2000 patients , found that OS was significantly improved when a \nfluoropyrimidine was added to gemcitabine.197 In a phase II randomized \ntrial, the effects of the FIRGEM regimen (irinotecan delivered before and \nafter infusion of 5 -FU/leucovorin [FOLFIRI.3 ], alternating with fixed -dose -\nrate [FDR] gemcitabine ) were assessed in 98 patients with metastatic \npancreatic cancer.203 Patients were randomized to receive the FIRGEM \nregimen or FDR gemcitabine monotherapy. The primary objective of a \n45% PFS rate at 6 months was reached, and PFS was a median of 5.0 \nmonths in those randomized to receive the FIRGEM regimen, while those \nrando mized to receive only gemcitabine had a median PFS of 3.4 months \n(HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38 –0.90). Rates of hematologic toxicity were higher \nin those who received the FIRGEM regimen, relative to those who \nreceived gemcitabine only. Study investigators deemed FIRGEM to be \neffective and feasible in the metastatic setting.  \nThe ECOG E2297 trial showed  no statistically significant survival \ndifferences between gemcitabine monotherapy and the combination of \ngemcitabine and bolus 5 -FU/leucovorin  in patients with advanced \npancreatic cancer .158 Although results are inconsistent, r andomized trials \nin Asia show ed that gemcitabine  in combination with the oral \nfluoropyrimidine S -1 may improve response and survival in patients with \nlocally advanced pancreatic cancer  compared with gemcitabine \nmonotherapy .204-206 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-17 Gemcitabine Monotherapy  \nFor patients  with newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic disease, \ngemcitabine provid ed a clinical benefit and a modest survival advantage \nover treatment with bo lus 5-FU.207 The Panel recommends  gemcitabine \nmonotherapy as one option for front-line therapy for patients with locally \nadvanced (category 2A) or metastatic disease ( category 1 ) and good PS. \nBecause the approved indications for gemcitabine inclu de relief of \nsymptoms, the Panel also  recommends  gemcitabine  monotherapy as a \nreasonable first-line and second -line option for symptomatic patients  with \nlocally advanced or metastatic disease with intermediate PS.  \nGemcitabine monotherapy is also recommended as a category 1 option in \nthe adjuvant setting. In the large phase III CONKO -001 trial, 368 patients \nwithout prior chemotherapy or RT were randomly assigned to adjuvant \ngemcitabine versus observation following macroscopically complete \nresection . An ITT analysis of the data showed that the study met the \nprimary endpoint of increased DFS (13.4 months vs. 6.9 months; P < .001, \nlog rank).208 Final results from this study showed median OS improved \nsignificantly for patients in the gemcitabine arm compared to the \nobservation arm (22.8 months vs. 20.2 months; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61 –\n0.95; P = .01).209 An absolute survival difference of 10.3% was observed \nbetween the two groups at 5 years (20.7% vs. 10.4%).209 \nGemcitabine Response: hENT1  \nhENT1 is a nucleoside transporter that has been studied as a predictor for \nresponse to gemcitabine.210 Preliminary clinical data  showed that hENT1 \nexpression may in fact predict response to gemcitabine.211-215 \nhENT1 was validated  as a predictive biomarker for benefit from \ngemcitabine in the adjuvant setting. A meta -analysis including 7 studies \nwith 770 patients with resected pancreatic cancer showed that hENT1 \nexpression was associated with DFS (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42 –0.79) and \nOS (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.38 –0.72) in patients who received adjuvant gemcitabine, but not in patients who received adjuvant \nfluoropyrimidine -based therapy.216 Two retrospective analyses from \nESPAC -3 and RTOG -9704 found the same results, although the adjuvant \nCONKO -001 and the AIO-PK0104 trials were unable to confirm these \nresults using a different antibody for IHC analysis (SP120).217,218 \nUnfortunately, these results could not be validated in the metastatic setting \nin the LEAP trial , which also used the SP120  assay to determine hENT1 \nexpression. Further studies based on hENT1 expression using the \n10D7G2 assay are limited  since  a commercial source of the antibody and \nCLIA -approved testing are not available.  \nFixed -Dose -Rate Gemcitabine  \nStudies have suggested that the infusion rate of gemcitabine may  be \nimportant for its efficacy. Clinical studies have shown that administering \ngemcitabine at a n FDR maximizes intracellular concentrations of the \nphosphorylated forms of gemcitabine .219 In a randomized phase II trial  of \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer , the \ninfusion of gemcitabine at a n FDR led to better survival compared with \ngemcitabine delivered at a higher dose, over 30 minutes .220 In the phase \nIII randomized ECOG -6201 trial of patients with advanced pancreatic \ncancer, median survival was higher  in the group receiving FDR \ngemcitabine v ersus standard gemcitabine (6.2 months vs. 4.9 months; P = \n.04), although this outcome did not satisfy the protocol -specified criteria for \nsuperiority .168 When gemcitabine is considered for the treatment of \nadvanced pancreatic cancer, the NCCN Panel views FDR gemcitabine (10 \nmg/m2/min) as a reasonable alternative to the standard infusion of \ngemcitabine over 30 minutes (category 2B)  only in patients with poor PS . \nFDR gemcitabine is incorporated into some commonly used \ngemcitabine -based regimens ( eg, GEMOX [gemcitabine  and oxaliplatin] ; \nGTX.162,163 The combination of FDR gemcitabine and capecitabine  has \nalso been found to be active and well -tolerated.198  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-18 A systematic review of clinical trials assess ing the efficacy of subsequent \ntherapy after gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer concluded that, while data \nare very limited, evidence suggests an advantage of additional \nchemotherapy over best supportive care.221 For patients with advanced \ndisease who have received prior gemcitabine -based therapy, \nfluoropyrimidine -based chemotherapy regimens are acceptable  \nsubsequent options  and vice  versa .222-225  \nNALIRIFOX  \nAn initial phase I/II trial evaluat ing the safety and efficacy of NALIRIFOX \nin the first -line setting for advanced pancreatic cancer  showed that th is \nregimen was manageable and tolerated with a median OS of 12.6 \nmonths .226 The follow -up phase III trial showed that first-line NALIRIFOX \ntreatment resulted in  a statistically significant improvement in OS and \nPFS compared with gemcitabine and albumin -bound paclitaxel \ncombination in those patients with out prior treatment and  metastatic \ndisease.227 Based on these results and the inclusion of <1% of patients \nwith ECOG ≥2, the Panel recommends NALIRIFOX as first -line therapy \nfor metastatic disease (category 1) and extrapolat ing its use in locally \nadvanced disease ( category 2A). The Panel recognizes that there is \nhigh-level evidence supporting NALIRIFOX use over gemcitabine and \nalbumin -bound paclitaxel ; however,  compared to FOLFIRINOX  this \nregimen does not appear to have an advantage and adds considerably \nmore expense .  \nCapecitabine -Based Regimens  \nThe Panel lists capecitabine monotherapy as first -line and second -line \ntreatment options for patients with locally advanced disease and \nmetastatic disease ( depending on PS ). Capecitabine is  also \nrecommended as an option in the adjuvant settings (category 2B).  The \ncapecitabine recommendation is supported by a randomized phase III \ncrossover trial from the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie (AIO) group in which OS was similar in patients with advanced pancreatic \ncancer receiving capecitabine plus erlotinib followed by gemcitabine \nmonotherapy or gemcitabine plus erlotinib followed by capecitabine \nmonotherapy. 228 Note that the capecitabine dose r ecommended by the \nPanel (1 000 mg/m2 PO twice daily) is less than the dose described by \nCartwright and colleagues, because the higher dose has been associated \nwith increased toxicity (eg, diarrhea, hand and foot syndrome).229 \nCapecitabine Plus Oxaliplatin  \nThe combination of capecitabine with oxaliplatin is listed as a possible \nfirst-line treatment for locally advanced/metastatic disease (category 2B) \ndepending on the PS and as a subsequent therapy option for patients with \ngood PS. The se recommendations are based on a phase II study  224 that \nonly enrolled patients who had received one prior chemotherapy regimen, \nbut the Panel feels the extrapolation to first -line therapy is appropriate \n(category 2B).   \n5-FU–Based Regimens  \nContinuous Infusion 5 -FU \nContinuous infusion 5 -FU is a first-line and second -line treatment option \nfor patients with locally advanced disease (category 2B), and for patients \nwith poor PS and metastatic disease (category 2B). It is also \nrecommended as an option  in the adjuvant setting (category 2A for \ncontinuous infusion 5 -FU). 228 \nFOLFOX  \nResults from the open -label phase III PANCREOX trial show that the \naddition of oxaliplatin to 5 -FU/leucovorin (OFF) in subsequent treatment \nmay be detrimental.230 In this trial, 108 patients with advanced pancreatic \ncancer who progressed on gemcitabine -based treatment were randomized \nto receive second -line mFOLFOX6 or infusional 5 -FU/ leucovorin. No \ndifference was seen in median PFS (3.1 vs. 2.9 months; P = .99), but \nmedian OS was worse  in those in the FOLFOX arm (6.1 vs . 9.9 mo nths; P PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

Furthermore, the addition of oxaliplatin resulted in increased \ntoxicity, with rates of grade 3/4 adverse events of  63% in the FOLFOX arm  \nand of 11% in the  5-FU/ leucovorin  arm. However, this trial was limited by \nimbalances in PS 2 proportion between the study arms and possible \ncrossover in treatment following progression.231 The randomized phase II \nSWOG S1115 trial showed that patients with metastatic disease that did \nnot respond to gemcitabine -based therapy ( n = 62) and who received \nmFOLFOX ( 5-FU and oxaliplatin) had a median OS of 6.7 months, which \nis comparable to the median OS rates found in the CONKO -003 and \nPANCREOX trials.232 The Panel therefore recommends FOLFOX as an \noption for patients with metastatic disease (PS 2) who cannot be \nadministered FOLFIRINOX because of their PS. FOLFOX is also a \nrecommended subsequent therapy option for patients with good P S.  \nOFF \nThe Panel bases 5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (OFF)  as a treatment option \nbased  on the randomized phase III CONKO  study that originally  tried to \ncompare  OFF to best supportive care.223 The initial trial was terminated \ndue to insufficient accrual (due to lack of acceptance of best supportive \ncare). The final results of the p hase III CONKO -003 trial comparing OFF \nto 5-FU/folinic acid  in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and \ndisease progression on first -line gemcitabine therapy  showed a median \nOS in the OFF arm of 5.9 months  (95% CI, 4.1 –7.4) versus 3.3 months  \n(95% CI, 2.7 –4.0) in the 5 -FU/leucovorin arm . This translated into a  \nsignificant improvement in the HR  (0.66; 95% CI, 0. 48–0.91; P = .01).233 \nTherefore, the  Panel recommends OFF as a category 2A option for \nsubsequent therapy (good PS) and by extrapolation as a category 2B \nfirst-line therapy option for both locally advanced and metastatic \npancreatic cancer for patients with good PS.  \nFOLFIRI  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends 5-FU + leucovorin + irinotecan ( FOLFIRI ) \nas an option for first-line therapy for patients with metastatic disease who cannot tolerate FOLFIRINOX  (intermediate PS -2) and for subsequent \ntherapy (good PS) . Toxicity and efficacy studies in small patient cohorts \nshowed that FOLFIRI was tolerable as first -line and subsequent therapies \nin patients with pancreatic cancer.234,235 A phase II trial found comparable \nefficacy and safety  for patients treated with mFOLFOX (n = 30 , OS: 14.9 \nweeks ) and modified FOLFIRI -3 (n = 31, OS: 16.6 weeks ) regimens \nwhose disease had previous ly not responded to gemcitabine treatment.236 \nAnother phase II trial investigated FOLFIRI in 63 patients with metastatic \ndisease treated with one to three lines of gemcitabine - and platinum -based \nchemotherapies  (in two different schedules reported together; FOLFIRI -1 \nand -3).235 The median OS was 6.6 months (95% CI, 5.3 –8.1 months). \nPatients who had grade 3 –4 toxicities (23.8%) experienced mainly \nhematologic or digestive toxicities. A GISCAD multicenter phase II study of \nlocally advanced or metastatic disease evaluated the FOLFIRI -2 regimen \nin patients previously treated with gemcitabine with or without \nplatinum-based therapies.237 OS was 5 months and toxicity such as grade \n3–4 neutropenia (20%) and diarrhea (12%) were manageable.  \n5-FU/Leucovorin/ Liposomal Irinotecan  \nIn the NAPOLI -1 phase III randomized trial, effects of nanoliposomal \nirinotecan were examined in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer \nwho previously received gemcitabine -based therapy.238 Patients were \nrandomized to receive nanoliposomal irinotecan monotherapy, \n5-FU/leucovorin, or both ( N = 417). Median PFS (3.1 months vs. 1.5 \nmonths; HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41 –0.75; P < .001) was significantly higher in \npatients who received nanoliposomal irinotecan with 5 -FU/leucovorin \ncompared to patients who did not receive irinotecan. Updated analyses \nshowed that median OS (6.2 months vs. 4.2 months; HR, 0.75; P = .042) \nwas significantly greater for patients who received nanoliposomal \nirinotecan with 5 -FU/leucovorin compared to patients who received \n5-FU/leucovorin without irinotecan.

The Panel recommends this \nregimen as a subsequent treatment option for patients with \ngood /intermediate  PS who received prior gemcitabine -based therapy  \n(category 1). It is a category 2A recommendation for patients who received \nprior fluoropyrimidine -based therapy and for those who did not receive \nirinotecan.  \nTargeted Therapy  \nLarotrectinib , Entrectinib , and Repotrectinib  \nNTRK  gene fusions, although rare, have been implicated in the \noncogenesis of pancreatic cancer. The efficacy and safety of \nlarotrectinib, an NTRK inhibitor, was investigated i n three multicenter, \nopen -label, single -arm trials (a phase I study in adults, a phase I/II study \nin children, and a phase II study in adolescents and adults).239,240 The \nprimary endpoint was set to be ORR and the secondary endpoints were \ndetermined to be PFS, duration of response  (DOR) , and safety. Among \n12 tumor types, the ORR during independent review was 75% (95% CI , \n61%–85%). After 9.4 months, 86% of participants had either under gone  \ncurative surgery or were continuing treatment. At 1 year, 55% of patients \nwere free of disease progression and the toxicity profile of the agent was \nminimal.239 Based on these data, larotrectinib was approved by the FDA \nin 2018 for the treatment of NTRK  gene fusion -positive solid tumors in \nadult and pediatric patients with known acquired resistance , with either \nmetastatic disease or in whom  surgical resection is likely to result in \nsevere morbidity, and who have no satisfactory alternative treatments or \nwhose cancer has progressed following treatment .240 Updated data \npublished in 2020 reported that 79% of patients had an objective \nresponse (95% CI , 72%–85%) with 16% showing a complete \nresponse.241 Similarly, entrectinib , another NTRK inhibitor , was approved \nin 2019 by the FDA for adult and pediatric patients ( aged ≥12 years) with \nadvanced, morbid, or unresectable NTRK  gene fusion -positive solid tumors with acquired resistance to standard treatment.242 Data from \nthree phase I–II trials (ALKA -372-001, STARTRK -1, and STARTRK -2) \nrevealed that entrectinib was associated with an ORR of 75% and a \nmedian DOR of 12.9 months. Like its predecessor, it had a tolerable \nsafety profile.243,244 Thus , the NCCN Panel recommends larotrectinib and \nentrectinib as first -line and subsequent treatment options for patients \nwith NTRK  gene fusion -positive locally advanced or metastatic \npancreatic adenocarcinoma  and for recurrent disease . The only setting in \nwhich these NTRK inhibitors are not recommended by the Panel is as \nfirst-line therapy for patients with locally advanced disease and poor P S. \nThe FDA issued  accelerated approval for repotrectinib , another NTRK -\nbased regimen, for  adult and pediatric patie nts 12 years and older with \nsolid tumors that have a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) \ngene fusion, are locally advanced or metastatic or where surgical \nresection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and that have progressed \nfollowing treatm ent or have no satisfactory alternative therapy.245 A small \nnumber of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were evaluated in \nthe TRIDENT trial,246 resulting in a category 2A recommendation as first -\nline therapy for patients with locally advanced (PS 0 -2) or metastatic \ndisease (PS 0 -2), and subsequent therapy or therapy for recurrent \ndisease for patients ( PS 0-1). Repotrectinib is a category 2B \nrecommendation as first -line for patients with metastatic disease (PS  3) \nand subsequent therapy or therapy for recurrent disease for patients with \nintermediate/poor PS (PS 2 -3). \nAdagrasib and Sotorasib  \nCodeBreak 100 (NCT03600883) was a phase I/II international, \nmulticenter, open -label, single -arm trial examining sotorasib in patients \nwith advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS G12C  mutation  and with at \nleast one prior therapy .247 In a subgroup analysis of patients with non-\nsmall cell lung cancer  (NSCLC ) (19/129 patients), 32.2% of the group \nhad confirmed objective responses and 88.1% of patients had disease \ncontrol (objective response or stable disease).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-21 FDA provided accelerated approval for sotorasib in KRAS  G12C -mutated \nlocally advanced or metastatic  NSCLC . This study also included a \nconfirmed partial response in one patient with advanced pancreatic \ncancer. In 2022, the efficacy of sotorasib was studied in a single -arm \nphase I/II trial in KRAS G12C -mutated advanced pancreatic cancer  (n = \n38).248 Eight patients had confirmed objective response , whereas six \npatients had grade 3 adverse events  that confirm ed some antitumor \nactivity and an acceptable safety profile of sotorasib in patients with \nadvanced pancreatic cancer. Sotorasib is recommended as a \nsubsequent therapy option as useful under certain circumstances for \npatients whose tumors have KRAS G12C  mutations.  \nAround a similar time, adagrasib received accelerated approval for adult \npatients with KRAS G12C -mutated locally advanced or metastatic \nNSCLC with at least one prior therapy . A multicohort phase I/II study \nevaluating adagrasib  showed partial responses in 50% of patients with \nadvanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma who received prior therapy.249 \nBased on these data  and nearly all pancreatic tumors having KRAS  \nmutations ,250 both adagrasib and sotorasib are recommended as \nsubsequent therapy options for patients with any PS (category 2B for \npoor PS).  \nDabrafenib/ Trametinib  \nA subprotocol of the NCI -MATCH platform trial and the ROAR basket \ntrial studied the efficacy of BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination of \ndabrafenib/trametinib  in solid tumors with BRAF V600E  mutations  and \nbiliary tract cancer, respectively .251,252 Both of these trials showed \nefficacy and acceptable toxicity profiles.  In 2022, the FDA provided \naccelerated approval for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients ≥6 \nyears of age with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF \nV600E  mutation with progress ion on prior treatment and no satisfactory \nalternat e treatments . In lieu of this, the Panel recommends \ndabrafenib/trametinib for first -line metastatic disease (category 2B) and as subsequent line options (category 2A) for patients with good/poor PS \nand with tumors that have BRAF V600E  mutations.  \n \nSelpercatinib  \nSelpercatinib , a kinase inhibitor , received  accelerated approval  from the \nFDA based on treatment of RET fusion -positive non -small cell lung , \nmedullary thyroid , and thyroid cancer s. The trial included 11 patients with \npancreatic adenocarcinoma, at least 50% of whom had objective \nresponse rates.253 Based on these observations, selpercatinib is a \nrecommended first-line therapy for patients with locally \nadvanced/metastatic disease (PS 0 –2) and as an subsequent therapy \noption for those with good PS  (0–1). \n \nFam-trastuzumab Deruxtecan -nxki \nIn 2024, the FDA granted accelerated approval to fam -trastuzumab \nderuxtecan -nxki for adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -\npositive (IHC3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options . The \nDESTINY -PanTumor2 trial included a total of 25 patients (all good PS) \nwith advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, with <20% of patients \nhaving tumors that expressed IHC 3+ HER2.254 Based on this the Panel \nrecommends fam -trastuzumab as a subsequent therapy option only for \npatients with good PS and HER2 IHC 3+ expression.  \n \nImmunotherapy  \nPembrolizumab  \nAdvances in research have revealed that h uman immune  checkpoint  \ninhibitor antibodies that prevent  the interactions between immune cells \nand antigen -presenting cells may also have a similar role  in tumor cells.255 \nThere is evidence that programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1) blockade \nwith pembrolizumab may be effective in tumors with dMMR.256 \nPembrolizumab is an anti -PD-1 receptor antibody and blocks its \ninteraction with programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) and PD -L2, releasing PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-22 PD-1–mediated inhibition of the immune response and improv ing \nantitumor immunity. The results of a phase II study in patients with 12 \ndifferent dMMR advanced cancers, including pancreas  (N = 6), found that \ntreatment with pembrolizumab resulted in durable responses (ORR in 53% \nof patients, with 21% complete response).257 Sixty -two percent  of patients \nhad an ORR , with two patients showing complete response and three \npatients showing progressive disease. Adverse events were experienced \nby 74% of all patients receiving pembrolizumab; most were low grade \n(20% experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events, such as diarrhea/colitis, \npancreatitis/hyperamylasemia, fatigue, arthritis/arthralgias, o r anemia).257 \nAdverse events for immune checkpoint inhibitors can be significant; please \nrefer to the NCCN Guidelines for the Management of \nImmunotherapy -Related Toxicities, available at www.NCCN.org . \nBased on these data, pembrolizumab was granted accelerated FDA \napproval in 2017  followed by full approval  for patients with unresectable \nor metastatic  MSI-high (MSI-H) or dMMR solid tumors that have \nprogressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory \nalternative treatment options. Similar results were reported from the \nphase II KEYNOTE -158 study. Among 27 noncolorectal tumor types, \nincluding pancreatic can cer, with a median follow -up of 13.4 months ; the \nORR was reported to be 34.3% (95% CI , 28.3%–40.8%), the median \nPFS was 4.1 months (95% CI , 2.4–4.9 months), and the median OS was \n23.5 months.258,259 Results from KEYNOTE -164 and 051 showed similar \ndurable antitumor activity, prolonged OS, and manageable safety in \ncertain pediatric tumors and in patients with previously treated MSI -\nH/dMMR colorectal cancer .260,261 These results led the FDA to grant  full \napproval for the use of pembrolizumab for patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic MSI -H or dMMR solid tumors that have progressed on prior \ntreatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. \nPembrolizumab is a recommended option by the NCCN Panel for the \nadvanced disease setting for first-line and subsequent treatment  (if no \nprior immunotherapy) . Dostarlimab -gxly \nDostarlimab -gxly was active across multiple tumor types , with an ORR of \n44.1% overall and 41.7% f or 11 patients with pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma.262 The safety profile of dostarlimab -gxly across \ndifferent tumor types was acceptable with manageable toxicities . \nDostarlimab -gxly received an  accelerated approval for the treatment of \nadult patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced solid tumors  that have \nprogressed on or following prior treatment with no satisfactory alternative \ntreatment s. The Panel consensus was to include dostarlimab -gxly as a \nsubsequent treatment option  (if no prior immunotherapy)  for patients with \nMSI-H or dMMR locally advanced, metastat ic, or recurrent pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma and any PS .  \nNivolumab/ Ipilimumab  \nCheckmate 848 , a randomized, open -label, phase II study , was \nconducted in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors of  TMB -\nhigh (TMB -H) and who were immunotherapy naïve .263 ORR and survival \noutcomes with the combination  improved in patients with TMB -H and \nwho had manageable safety profiles. With limited data on pancreatic \ncancer, the Panel consensus resulted in  nivolumab/ipilimumab being \nrated a category 2B, subsequent therapy option for patients  with good or \nintermediate PS and those who did not receive prior immunotherapy .  \nMaintenance Therapy in Advanced Disease  \nWith the success of more effective regimens in patients with advanced \ndisease, questions have been raised about how best to manage the \ntreatment -free interval prior to disease progression. Options include \ncontinuing systemic therapy, stopping treatment, dropping the most toxic \nagents, and using different agents for maintenance therapy.  \nBRCA  genes encode for proteins involved in homologous recombination \nrepair  and cells with BRCA  mutations are sensitive to PARP inhibitors ; the \nefficacy of olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was investigated.

A total of 154 patients were randomized to receive either olaparib \nor placebo. In the olaparib arm, median PFS was 7.4 months compared to \n3.8 months in the placebo arm  (95% CI , 0.35–0.82, P = .004). At the \ninterim  analysis , however,  there was no difference in OS between olaparib \nand placebo groups (18.9 months vs. 16.1 months, 95% CI , 0.56–1.46; P \n= .68). Adverse events, such as grade 3 or higher, were found to be higher \nin the olaparib arm than in the placebo arm (40% vs. 23%).265 Based on  \nthese  data, the Panel recommends olaparib as a preferred targeted \nmaintenance therapy for patients with germline BRCA -mutated metastatic \ndisease and no disease progression after 4  to 6 months of first -line \nplatinum -based therapy. Other maintenance therapy options for patients \ninclude clinical trial enrollment ; gemcitabine -based therapy for patients \nwho received previous first -line gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel; or \ncapecitabine, 5 -FU with or without irinotecan, or FOLFOX for patients who \nreceived previous FOLFIRINOX. The Panel included 5 -FU with or without \nirinotecan for patients who exhibited oxaliplatin -related progressive \nneuropathy or allergy. Finally, if irinotecan -related gastroin testinal ( GI) \ntoxicity is of concern, then FOLFOX may be a suitable maintenance \ntherapy.  \nFuture Clinical Trials : Recommendations for Design  \nIn 2007 , a meeting was convened by the National Cancer Institute’s \nGastrointestinal Cancer Steering Committee in recognition of several  \nphase III trials failing to show clinically significant benefit for patients with \npancreatic cancer  and to address the importance of integrating basic and clinical knowledge in the design of clinical trials in pancreatic cancer. \nMeeting participants included representatives from industry, government , \nand the community, as well as academic researchers and patient \nadvocates. Several important themes emerging from this meeting are \nsummarized below , and the recommendations put forward by the \ncommittee are endorsed by the NCCN Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma \nPanel .266 \n• With the emergence of new agents to treat pancreatic cancer, \nparticularly biologics, clinical trial strategies incorporating \nprinciples of molecular biology and new imaging methods as well \nas results from preclinical studies are important . \n• For patients enrolled in clinical trials, banking of tumor tissue \nsamples should be required along with paired blood and serum \nsamples . \n• Biomarkers that serve as surrogate markers of the anticancer \neffects of investigational agents should be sought, and assays to \nmeasure such biomarkers should be well validated . \n• Clinical trials should enroll homogeneous patient populations with \nrespect to disease stage ( ie, separate trials for patients with \nlocally advanced disease and metastatic disease) and patient PS. \nCriteria for selecting study populations should take into account \nthe putative differential efficacy of the agent ( ie, vaccines in \npatients with early -stage disease) . \n• Phase III trials should not be initiated in the absence of clinically \nmeaningful efficacy an d safety signals in the phase II  setting.  \n• Phase II and III clinical trials should have OS as a primary \nendpoint . \n• Quality control standards for preoperative imaging interpretation, \npathologic assessment of tumor specimens, and surgical \nselection criteria are critical when evaluating adjuvant therapies . \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-24 A 2011 consensus report from a group of European experts came to \nmany of the same conclusions.267 Additionally, the group states that \nFOLFIRINOX can be considered as a new standard treatment option in \nselected patients  in future clinical trials ; however , gemcitabine should \nremain the standard for most patients. An international expert panel also \nmet to discuss current and future pancreatic cancer research and came \nto similar conclusions.268 In addition, the Intergroup Pancreatic Cancer \nTask Force’s Tissue Acquisition Working Group has made \nrecommendations regarding the prospective collection and sharing of \ntissue to accelerate the discovery of predictive and prognostic \nbiomarkers.269 These recommendations include centralization of \nbiorepositories and mandatory collection of tissue (when there is \nsufficient material), blood, serum, and plasma in all phase III trials.  \nASCO convened a working group to discuss designs for pancreatic \ncancer clinical trials that would accomplish meaningful clinical \nimprovements.270 This group concluded OS should be the primary \nendpoint of first -line, metastatic pancreatic cancer trials. They also \nconcluded that trials should aspire to a 3 - to 4-month improvement in OS \nin gemcitabine -eligible and gemcitabine/ albumin -bound paclitaxel -eligibl e \npatients  and a 4 - to 5-month improvement in OS for \nFOLFIRINOX -eligible patients  to have endpoints with true clinical impact.  \nA systematic review including 32 phase III trials showed that the \nfollowing benchmarks for phase II trials were most predictive of a \nclinically meaningful phase III trial: 50% improvement in OS, 90% \nincrease in 1 -year survival, or 80% to 100% increase in PFS.271 \nFurthermore, a n algorithm , based on an analysis of a database of \ncooperative group trials , has been developed to calculate historic \nbenchmarks for OS and PFS  for single -arm phase II trials based on \ngemcitabine .272 Radiation and Chemoradiation Approaches  \nRadiation is usually given concurrently with gemcitabine - or \nfluoropyrimidine -based chemotherapy  in patients with pancreatic cancer . \nAlthough the mechanism of radiosensitization i s unclear, it is postulated \nthat gemcitabine and fluoropyrimidines decrease the number of tumor \ncells in S phase of the cell cycle  during which cells are resistant to \nradiation damage.273 \nRadiation and c hemoradiation are sometimes used for pancreatic cancer \nin the resectable and adjuvant setting s, because these treatment methods  \ncould potentially decrease local recurrence .274 A major goal of radiation \ntherapy (RT) in these settings is to sterilize vessel margins and increase \nthe likelihood of margin‐negative resection.  It may also be used to \nenhance local control and prevent disease progression, while minimizing \nthe risk of RT exposure to surrounding organs at risk . Chemoradiation is \noften incorporated into neoadjuvant regimens, although randomized trials \ndemonstrating the role of chemoradiation in this setting have not been \nperformed . The Panel notes that practices vary with r egard to \nchemoradiation  in the neoadjuvant setting , and when feasible should be \ncoordinated through a high -volume center when neoadjuvant therapy is  \nbeing  considered or recommended. Chemoradiation can also be given as \nsecond -line therapy in patients with locally advanced disease  following \ninduction chemotherapy  if the primary site is the sole site of progression  or \nin patients who are not candidates for induction chemotherapy . Finally , \nradiation  without chemotherapy  is used in the metastatic or non -metastatic \nsettin g as a palliative measure .  \nStereotactic body RT (SBRT) , another technique aimed at increasing dose \nto the gross tumor while sparing radiation to nearby healthy tissue , has \nbeen studied in various stages of pancreatic cancer .275-279 Retrospective \nanalyses from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) including patients \nwith locally advanced pancreatic cancer ( N = 988 , propensity matched PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-25 groups ) showed that patients treated with SBRT had better median OS \n(13.9 vs. 11.6 months, respectively; P < .001) and 2 -year OS (21.7% vs. \n16.5%, respectively; P = .001), compared to patients treated with \nconventionally fractionated RT.280 Analyses of patient -reported outcomes \nfrom a phase II trial in which patients with locally advanced pancreatic \ncancer received SBRT either upfront or following gemcitabine showed that \nSBRT did not significantly impact global QOL  and improved pancreatic \npain ( P = .001) and body image ( P = .007), based on assessment at 4 to 6 \nweeks following treatment.281 However, 4 months after treatment, role \nfunctioning was negatively impacted ( P = .002). Results from a \nprospective trial showed that SBRT was associated with less severe \nradiation -induced lymphopenia 1 month after beginning treatment, relative \nto conventional chemoradiation (13.8% vs. 71.7%, respectively; P < \n.001).282 SBRT should not be used if direct invasion of the bowel or \nstomach is observed on imaging, and care should be taken to limit dose to \nthese areas to reduce treatment -related toxicity. SBRT delivered in 3 to 5 \nfractions may reduce toxicity, though longer fo llow-up may then be \nneeded.283 Since the data regarding appropriate use of SBRT are \nevolving, the Panel recommends that SBRT should preferably be used in \nthe context of a clinical trial and at an experienced high -volume center.  \nAdjuvant Chemoradiation  \nIn the 1980s, the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) initially \nreported that the median survival of patients undergoing \npancreatoduodenectomy could be prolonged (almost 2-fold) by \npostoperative chemoradiation .284,285 In this study, patients were randomly \nassigned to either observation or RT combined with an intermittent bolus \nof 5-FU after resection. A standard split course of 4,000 cGy was used.  \n5-FU, 500 mg/m2 daily for 3 days, was given concurrently with each \n2,000 -cGy segment of RT. The 5 -FU regimen was then continued weekly \nfor a full 2 years. In addition to prolonged median survival, chemoradiation also resulted in a 2-year actuarial survival of 42%, compared with 15% in \nthe control group .284 \nOther studies have also shown an advantage to adjuvant chemoradiation \nover observation after resection. EORTC conducted a phase III trial \n(40891) in patients with  adenocarcinoma , in the  pancreatic head and \nperiampullary regions , assessing adjuvant RT and 5 -FU versus \nobservation alone after surgery. They found that the benefit of therapy was \nsmall in a subset of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and was not \nstatistically significant .286 At a median follow -up of 11.7 years, no \nstatistically significant differences  were observed  in PFS or OS in the \ndifferent study arms.287 \nMore contemporary studies have compared different regimens \nincorporating chemoradiation. The phase III Radiation Therapy Oncology \nGroup study , RTOG 9704 , evaluated the addition of gemcitabine to \nadjuvant  5-FU-based chemoradiation  in patients with resected pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma .288 Results of this study showed that, for patients with \ntumors of the pancrea tic head ( n = 388), there was a non -statistically \nsignificant increase in OS in the gemcitabine arm compared with the 5 -FU \narm ( 20.5 vs. 16.9 months median survival ; P = .09 ). This benefit became \nmore pronounced on multivariate analysis (HR, 0.80; 95% CI , 0.63 –1.00; \nP = .05). The 5 -year analysis of RTOG 9704 showed that there was in fact \nno OS difference between the two groups, although multivariate analysis \nshowed that patients with  tumors in the head of the pancreas trend ed \ntoward s improved OS with gemcitabine ( P = .08).289 \nThe Role of Radiation in  Adjuvant Regimens  \nThe majority of data comparing chemotherapy to chemoradiation in the \nadjuvant setting does  not generally show an advantage to the addition of \nradiation . Results of ESPAC -1 suggested  that addition of radiation to \nadjuvant 5 -FU chemotherapy may be  unnecessary and perhaps even \nharmful  (OS, 13.9, 21.6, and 19.9 months for chemoradiation, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

In addition, \nthe multicenter, open -label, randomized phase III CapRI trial found that \nadjuvant chemoradiation  with 5 -FU, cisplatin, and interferon alfa -2b \nfollowed by 5 -FU chemotherapy result ed in no better outcomes than \nadjuvant treatment with 5 -FU alone.295 \nA meta -analysis of 15 prospective, randomized trials found that adjuvant \nchemoradiation did not improve DFS, 2 -year survival, or OS (OR, 0.99; P \n= .93) compared to surgery alone, while adjuvant chemotherapy improved \nDFS, 2 -and 5 -year survival, and OS  (OR for OS, 1.98; P < .001).296 \nAnother  meta -analysis of 9 trials found similar results, with HRs of 0.62 for \n5-FU (95% CI, 0.42–0.88), 0 .68 for gemcitabine  (95% CI, 0.44–1.07), 0. 91 \nfor chemoradiation ( 95% CI, 0.55–1.46), 0 .54 for chemoradiation plus \n5-FU (95% CI, 0.15–1.80), and  0.44 for chemoradiation plus gemcitabine  \n(95% CI, 0.10–1.81) compared to no adjuvant treatment .297 \nHowever, a population -based assessment of patient outcomes in the \nNCDB  for those undergoing pancreatic cancer resect ions between 1998 to \n2002 found the opposite result: chemoradiation was associated with  better \nOS than chemotherapy in a performance -status –matched comparison to \nno adjuvant treatment (HR, 0.70; 95 % CI, 0.61–0.80 vs. HR, 1.04; 95 % CI, \n0.93–1.18) .298 A multi-institutional pooled analysis  of 955 consecutive \npatients  with pancreatic cancer who had R0 -1 resections also showed  that \nadjuvant chemoradiation improved survival compared to chemotherapy \nalone (OS, 39.9 months vs. 27.8 months; P < .001).299 To definitively clarify the role of chemoradiation following gemcitabine \nmonotherapy in the adjuvant  setting , RTOG is conducting trial 0848 \n(NCT01013649) . In step 1 of this protocol  (the chemotherapy comparison \narm), patients were randomized to adjuvant gemcitabine versus the \ncombination of gemcitabine and erlotinib ; however , there was no  OS \ndifferences between the two groups .300 Similarly, a djuvant SBRT did not \nprovide survival benefit or improved local disease control for resected \nstage II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) in a single -center \nrandomized control trial .301  \nBenefit of Adjuvant Chemoradiation in Patient Subsets  \nStudies that have looked at subsets of patients with R0 or R1 resections \nhave found mixed results. For instance, patients treated in the ESPAC -1 \ntrial did not derive a benefit from the addition of radiation to adjuvant \nchemotherapy, irrespective of margin status.302 In contrast, results from a \nprospective database with 616 patients who had resected pancreatic \ncancer found that adjuvant chemoradiation benefited both the R0 and R1 \nsubsets compared to observation alone.303 A retrospective review of \npatients who had R0 resections for pancreatic adenocarcinoma  found an \nOS benefit in those receiving adjuvant chemoradiation over observation.304 \nIn addition, a retrospective review of >1200 resected patients who \nreceived adjuvant 5 -FU–based chemoradiation or were observed following \nresection found that chemoradiation improved outcomes regardless of \nmargin status (R0: RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47 –0.77; P < .001; R1: RR, 0.52; \n95% CI, 0.36 –0.74; P < .001).305 A meta -analysis of four RCTs found \nevidence of increased survival benefit with adjuvant chemoradiation in the \nR1 subset (HR for death, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.47 –1.10) over the R0 subset \n(HR for death, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.95 –1.49).306  \nFewer analyses have looked at the role of chemoradiation in resected \npatients with positive lymph nodes.

An initial study by GITSG showed that the \ncombination of bolus 5 -FU and split -course radiation (total dose, 4000 \ncGy) resulted in a  nearly 2-fold increase in median survival (42.2 vs . 22.9 \nweeks)  compared with radiation alone .285 Subsequent studies have sought \nto optimize the use of 5 -FU, and most contemporary studies no longer use \nsplit-course radiation.  Multiple studies studied the utility of gemcitabine as \npart of chemoradiation .309-313 Some e vidence even suggest s that \nconcurrent gemcitabine and radiation can yield similar or better outcomes \nwhen compared with 5-FU–based chemoradiation  in the setting of locally \nadvanced disease.311,314 -316 Capecitabine was also assessed in a small \nnumber of patients .317 Health -related QOL  scores (ie, cognitive \nfunctioning, fatigue, bloating, dry mouth, body image, future health \nconcerns) of this trial favor ed capecitabine -based chemoradiation, \ncompared to gemcitabine -based chemoradiation.318 Therefore, the Panel \nlists 5 -FU- and capecitabine -based chemoradiation as preferred regimen s \nand gemcitabine as an other recommended chemoradiation -based \nregimen . \nUpfront Chemoradiation or SBRT in Locally Advanced Disease  \nResults of two early randomized trials comparing upfront chemoradiation \nto chemotherapy in locally advanced disease showed contradictory results and were not able to  confirm superiority of upfront chemoradiation .319,320 \nAdditional phase II trials assessed the upfront chemoradiation approach in \nlocally advanced PDAC , with median survival rates ranging from 8.2 to 9 \nmonths.309,321 -323 Results from small, single -arm trials of induction \nchemotherapy followed by chemoradiation in locally advanced disease  \nshow median survival between 12 to 19 months .324 \nThe phase III randomized ECOG -4201 trial that assessed the addition of \nradiation to gemcitabine chemotherapy compared with gemcitabine alone \nin patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer was closed early due \nto poor accrual . However, an ITT analysis of data for the 74 patients \nenrolled in this study showed that median OS was significantly longer in \nthe chemoradiation therapy arm of the study (11.1 months vs. 9.2 months; \none-sided P = .017 by stratified log -rank test ).313 However, the poor \naccrual rate decreased its statistical power  resulting in no difference in \nPFS and the CIs for OS overlapped between the two groups of patients325 \nThe benefit of chemotherapy  versus chemoradiation was also addressed \nin the phase III FFCD -SFRO study  from France  that showed gemcitabine \nalone was associated with a significantly increased OS rate at 1 year \ncompared with chemoradiation (53% vs. 32%; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31 –\n0.96; P = .006)  in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.326 This \nstudy was stopped before the planned accrual , because an interim \nanalysis revealed that patients in the chemoradiation arm had a lower \nsurvival rate. Patients in the chemoradiation arm also experienced severe  \ntoxicity  and were more likely to receive a shorter course of maintenance \ntherapy with gemcitabine, suggesting that the observed differences in \nsurvival were most likely attributable to toxicity associated with the  \nchemoradiation regimen.  \nUpfront SBRT may be used in patients with locally advanced disease who \nare not candidates for combination systemic treatment.

If patients present with poorly \ncontrolled pain or local invasion with bleeding , then starting with upfront \nchemoradiation therapy or SBRT is an option.309,313 \nChemoradiation or SBRT Following Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced \nDisease  \nBased on certain study results, s tarting with 2 to 6 cycles of systemic \nchemotherapy followed by chemoradiation  or SBRT is an option under \nuseful in certain circumstances for selected p atients with locally advanced \ndisease and good /intermediate  PS who have not developed systemic \nmetastatic disease.329-331 SBRT or chemoradiation may delay time to \ndisease progression.  Employing an initial course of chemotherapy may \nimprove systemic disease control. In addition, the natural history of the \ndisease can become apparent during initial chemotherapy  allowing for \nselection of patients most likely to benefit from subsequent \nchemoradiation. For  example, a retrospective analysis of outcomes from \nthe GERCOR studies indicate that first -line treatment with chemotherapy \nmay be a useful strategy for selecting patients , with locally advanced \ndisease and no rapid progression , who are more likely to benefit from \nsubsequent chemoradiation therapy.329  \nIn the randomized phase II SCALOP trial, patients with locally advanced \npancreatic cancer received gemcitabine and capecitabine combination \nchemotherapy, followed by either gemcitabine - or capecitabine -based chemoradiation ( n = 74).317,332 Though OS and PFS did not significantly \ndiffer between the two treatment arms, results favored capecitabine -based \nchemoradiation, with a median OS of 17.6  vs. 14.6 months and a median \nPFS of 12  vs. 10.5 months  compared to gemcitabine -based \nchemoradiation .332 \nIn the international phase III LAP -07 RCT, patients with locally advanced \npancreatic cancer ( n = 269  after second randomization ) received \nchemoradiation with capecitabine following 4 months of induction \nchemotherapy with either gemcitabine monotherapy or gemcitabine and \nerlotinib.333 Chemoradiation in this setting provided no survival benefit, \ncompared to chemotherapy only ( HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.79–1.34; P = .83) . \nSBRT following gemcitabine monotherapy was associated with low toxicity \nand favorable freedom from local disease progression in patients with \nlocally advanced pancreatic cancer has also been examined in phase II \ntrials.334,335  \nAdvanced Radiation Techniques  \nIntensity -modulated RT ( IMRT ) is increasingly being applied for therapy of \nlocally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma and in the adjuvant setting \nwith the aim of increasing radiation dose to the gross tumor while \nminimizing toxicity to surrounding tissues.336-340 A retrospective treatment \nplanning study that evaluated whether dose escalation might have been \npossible in 15 patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma if IMRT had been used instead of 3D conformal planning  \nconcluded that IMRT would have allowed for a significant increase in \ntarget dose volume .340 However , there is no clear consensus on the \nappropriate maximum dose of radiation when IMRT is used. A systematic \nreview including 13 IMRT studies showed that IMRT does not improve \nsurvival outcomes, compared to 3D  conformal RT ( CRT).341 However, \ntoxicities grade 3 or greater , mainly GI, specifically nausea/vomiting and \ndiarrhea, were more numerous in 3D -CRT, relative to IMRT ( P = .017).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-29 IMRT resulted in reduced grade 3/4 toxicities when the authors made a \ncross -study comparison of toxicities in patients who received  a similar \n5-FU–based regimen with  3D-CRT in the RTOG 9704 trial .288,342 \nComparing the two trials, rates of grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting were 0% \nvs. 11% ( P = .024) , and rates of grade 3/4 diarrhea were 3% vs. 18% ( P = \n.017),342 suggesting that IMRT may be well -tolerated and allow for higher \nradiation doses to the tumor.342  \nManagement of Metastatic Disease  \nThe primary goals of treatment for metastatic  pancreatic cancer are \npalliation and lengthened survival. Survival benefits are usually limited to \npatients with adequate PS (ECOG 0 -1, with good  biliary drainage , and \nadequate nutritional intake). Systemic therapy is therefore recommended \nfor patients with metastatic disease and good PS, as described in \nSystemic Therapy Approaches for Locally Advanced or Metastatic \nDisease , above, and in the algorithm.  \nPatients who present with poor PS may benefit from single -agent \nchemotherapy  (gemcitabine , standard infusion, is a category 1 \nrecommendation) . Alternative option s for patients with poor PS include  \ntargeted therapy based on molecular profiling and as clinically indicated, \npalliative RT, and palliative an d best supportive care.  Patients with \nmetastatic disease are generally not candidates for RT. However, \npalliative RT may be administered to patients who present with poor PS \n(ie, patients who are older and/or not candidates for definitive treatment), \ninstead of single -agent chemotherapy. A short course of RT may be \nadministered to metastatic sites that cause pain (eg, osseous pain).343 For \npatients with metastatic disease who do well on initial therapy, a \nchemotherapy holiday is appropriate, or maintenance therapy can be \nconsidered. In case of disease progression, subsequent therapy can be \nconsidered . But comfort -directed measures are always paramount ( see Palliative and Supportive Care , below, and the various NCCN  Guidelines \nfor Supportive Ca re, available at www.NCCN.org ). \nBefore initiating therapy, an open dialogue regarding the goals  and side \neffects  of treatment should take place  and, if needed, adjunctive strategies \ncan be used. Of note, patients with advanced disease may have abrupt \nchanges in clinical status. Therefore, if treatment is initiated , it should \nproceed with close monitoring and follow -up. Patients may experience \nsudden onset of bleeding or thromboembolism, rapidly escalating pain, \nbiliary stent occlusion, cholangitis, or other infections. Moreover, clinicall y \nmeaningful tumor s may develop quickly, and new tumor -related symptoms \nmay be inappropriately attributed to chemotherapy or other causes. For \ninstance, patients who complain of intractable nausea and vomiting may \nhave gastric outlet obstruction rather than chemotherapy -induced emesis. \nPeritoneal carcinomatosis may manifest as ascites or in its more subtle \nform, as abdominal bloating, as decreased oral intake, and /or as \nconstipation.  \nManagement of Locally Advanced Disease  \nAs in the metastatic setting, the primary goals of treatment of patients with \nlocoregional ly advanced  pancreatic cancer are palliation and lengthened \nsurvival.  Patients with locally advanced disease are treated with systemic \ntherapy based on their PS. Palliative and best supportive care  and \nsingle -agent chemotherapy  or palliative RT  are options for patients with \npoor PS, whereas patients with good PS can be treated  with more \nintensive therapy , as described in Systemic Therapy Approaches  for \nLocally Advanced  or Metastatic Disease , above, and in the algorithm . \nHistorically, most studies in the locally advanced setting use gemcitabine \nmonotherapy.

If \ndisease progression occurs in patients with locally advanced disease, \nclinical trial (preferred) or systemic therapy or chemoradiation or SBRT are \ntreatment options . However, chemoradiation or SBRT i s only \nrecommended for those who maintain good PS, if chemoradiation or \nSBRT were not previously given, and the primary site is the sole site of \nprogression.  \nIrreversible electroporation (IRE) is an ablative technique in which electric \npulses are used to create nanopores to induce cell death. This technique \nhas been used in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer and \nmay be safe  and feasible and improve survival .350-352 However, due to \nconcerns about complications and technical expertise,353 the Panel does \nnot currently recommend IRE for treatment of locally advanced pancreatic \ncancer.  \nManagement of Resectable and Borderline Resectable \nDisease  \nSurgic al Management  \nThe goals of surgery for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas include an \noncologic resection of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. \nSurgical resection is the only potentially curative technique for managing \npancreatic cancer.  However, >80% of patients present with disease that is \nnot resect able.354 Surgery should be done efficiently, optimizing QOL and cost. E arly concerns about high mortality associated with various \npancreatic resection procedures355 were  lessened by studies \ndemonstrating an acceptably low (<5%) mortality in experienced \ncenters .356 Even under the most optimal clinical trial  conditions, the \nmedian survival of resected patients following adjuvant therapy  ranges \nfrom 20.1 to 28.0 months.208,288,290,357,358 Negative margin status (ie, R0 \nresection), t umor DNA content, small tumor size, and absence of lymph \nnode metastases are the strongest prognostic indicators for long -term \npatient survival .359-361  \nCriteria for Resection  \nThe Panel recommends that decisions about diagnostic management and \nresectability always involve multidisciplinary consultation  at high -volume \ncenters with use of  appropriate high-quality imaging studies . Although it is \nclear that patients with visceral, peritoneal, or pleural metastases  or with \nmetastases to nodes beyond the field of resection  derive no benefit from \nresection, institutions differ in their approaches to patients with \nlocoregional disease involvement  (pancreas and peripancreatic lymph \nnode s). \nCareful intraoperative staging should rule out peritoneal, liver, and distant \nlymph node metastases, and resection of the primary tumor should only \nbe done in the absence of distant disease. The surgical procedure \nrequired is based on the location of prima ry tumor and relationship to \nblood vessels. Therefore, a pancreas CT protocol is critical for \npreoperative planning.  \nThe Panel recommends considering frozen section analysis of the \npancreatic neck and bile duct at the time of surgery. Frozen sections \nshould be taken approximately 5 mm from the transection margin, with the \nclean -cut side facing down, to avoid cautery artifact that may confound \nanalysis and result in false negatives.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-31 at least 5 mm of clearance.  A review of four studies with 2580 patients \nshowed that additional resection to achieve a negative surgical margin \nwas not associated with improved survival.362 For cancers involving head \nand uncinate  of the pancreas , a pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple \nprocedure) is performed . For cancers involving body and tail  of the \npancreas , a distal pancreatectomy with en -bloc splenectomy is performed . \nBased on their clinical experience with the primary management of \npancreatic tumors , an expert consensus and other groups developed \ncriteria to define tumor resectability to improve patient selection for surgery \nand increase the likelihood of an R0 resection.62,363 -365 A more restrictive \ndefinition of borderline resectable pancreatic tumors has also been \ndescribed.366 This definition uses degrees of contact (eg, interface \nbetween tumor and SMA measuring ≤180° of vessel wall circumference) \nand contour deformity/narrowing (eg, tear drop deformity in the MPV or \nSMV) to ascribe likelihood of vascular invasion rather than subjective \nterms such as abutment and impingement. The Panel endorses this \ndefinition for use in clinical trials.  Degree of contact and deformity are \nmuch more objective and are more easily communicated. Deformity , in \nparticular , is extremely accurate in predicting vascular invasion and the \nneed for resection/reconstruction.  Using a combination of  these sets of \ncriteria, tumors are classified as resectable , borderline resectable, locally \nadvanced, or metastatic disease.  \nThe Panel has adapted the criteria put forth by other groups and lists its \nrecommended criteria for defining resectability status in the guidelines. \nThe consensus of the Panel is that patients should be selected for surgery \non the basis of curative intent as determined by the probability of obtaining \nnegative (R0) resection margins . The likelihood of attaining negative \nmargins is the key criterion for consideration when determining whether a \npatient is a potential candidate for resection.365,367 Therefore , a borderline \nresectable lesion can be defined as one in which there is a higher probability  of an incomplete resection. Patients at high  risk for positive \nsurgical margins are not considered to be good candidates for upfront \nresection but may be potentially down staged  and safely resected \nfollowing neoadjuvant therapy. The Panel recommends that patient factors \nbe considered when deciding whether a patient is a surgical candidate  and \ndecisions about resectability status be made in consensus in \nmultidisciplinary meetings/discussions . Comorbidities, PS, and frailty are \nall things to be discussed  during the multidisciplinary review. Please refer \nto the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology (available at \nwww.NCCN.org ) for further discussion of the treatment of older patients.  \nPrimary Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer   \nThe nature and extent of surgery for resectable tumors depend on the \nlocation and size of the tumor. Because tumors of the pancreatic body and \ntail cause symptoms late in their development, they are usually advanced \nat diagnosis and are rarely  resectable. When tumors in the pancreatic tail \nare resectable, distal pancreatectomy, in which the surgeon removes the \ntail and body of the pancreas, as well as the spleen, is commonly \nperformed. If the cancer diffusely involves the pancreas or is present at \nmultiple sites within the pancreas, a total pancreatectomy may be required \nwhere the surgeon removes the entire pancreas, part of the small \nintestine, a portion of the stomach, the common bile duct, gallbladder, \nspleen, and nearby lymph nodes.  Patients with tumors in the head of the \npancreas, who usually present because of jaundice, are treated with open \nor minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (ie, the Whipple \nprocedure).368,369 \nIn patients with suspected borderline resectable disease for whom cancer \nis not confirmed following repeated biopsy with EUS -FNA, referral to a \nhigh-volume center for further evaluation is recommended. If biopsy is \npositive, the Panel recommends considering ERCP with stent placement \nfollowed by neoadjuvant therapy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-32 during surgery, the Panel recommends biopsy confirmation of \nadenocarcinoma and genetic testing for inherited mutations , if not \npreviously performed. If a patient with jaundice is found to be unresectable \nat surgery, then the Panel recommends surgical biliary bypass at that \ntime, unless biliary bypass was performed at the time of laparoscopy or \nlaparotomy . If a stent has been previously placed, then surgical biliary \nbypass could be considered. In addition , gastrojejunostomy can be \nconsidered if appropriate regardless of jaundice . Celiac plexus neurolysis \ncan also be performed, especially when indicated by pain in a patient with \njaundice (category 2B if no pain).  \nPancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple Procedure)  \nAchiev ing a margin -negative  dissection requires focusing  on meticulous \nperivascular dissection of the lesion, recogni zing the need for vascular \nresection and/or reconstruction, and the potential need for \nextra -pancreatic organ resection. However , the biology of the cancer might \nnot allow for an R0 resection even with the most meticulous surgery.  \nMedial dissection of pancreatic head lesions is best achieved by complete \nmobilization of the PV and SMV from the uncinate process (assuming \nthere is no evidence of tumor infiltration). Further, skeletonization of the \nlateral, posterior, and anterior borders of the SMA down to the level of the \nadventitia will maximize uncinate yield and radial margin (see Figure \n1).370,371 Optimal dissection and skeletonization of the SMA can be \nachieved using ultrasonic or thermal dissectors. Division of the \nretroperitoneal tissues between the uncinate process and SMA with a \nstapler or a clamp and cut technique may leave up to 43% of the s oft \ntissue in situ and result in suboptimal clearance and increase the risk of an \nR1 resection.372,373  \nIn the absence of frank venous occlusion noted on preoperative imaging, \nthe need for lateral venorrhaphy or complete PV /SMV resection and \nreconstruction to achieve an R0 resection may be suggested, but it is often not known until division of the pancreatic neck has occurred. \nTethering of carcinoma to the lateral wall of the PV is not uncommon and , \nif at all possible,  requires careful dissection to free the vein from the \npancreatic head. It is frequently impossible to d ifferentiat e tumor infiltration \ninto the vein wall from tumor -related desmoplasia. Liberal use of partial or \ncomplete vein resection when vein infiltration is suspected during Whipple \nprocedures has been studied.374-376 On evaluation of excised vein \nspecimens, only 60% to 70% had histologic evidence of frank tumor \ninvolvement, and R0 resections were still not obtainable in 10% to 30% of \npatients despite increasing the magnitude of operative procedure. \nHowever, if an R0 r esection is obtained with vein excision, longevity \nappears similar to those with R0 resections without venous involvement, \nwith no significant increase in morbidity and mortality. These data support \nan aggressive approach to partial or complete vein excisi on if tumor \ninfiltration is suspected.  \nAlthough numbers are more limited, similar findings have been noted in \ncases of  hepatic arterial resection and reconstruction.376,377 A \npopulation -based study of 10,206 patients from the Nationwide Inpatient \nSample from years 2000 through 2009 found that although no differences \nin mortality w ere observed, vascular reconstruction (about 90% venous \nand 10% arterial) is associated with a higher risk of intraoperative and \npostoperative complications.378 Others have noted poor short - and \nlong-term outcomes with arterial resection.378,379 While further data with \nrespect to arterial resection are clearly needed, judicious utilization of this \ntechnique would appear to be reasonable in very select populations.  \nDistal Pancreatect omy with En -bloc Splenectomy  \nThe goals of left -sided resection are similar  to those of \npancreatoduodenectomy, although they are often more difficult to achieve \nbecause of the advanced stage at which most of these cancers are \ndiscovered.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-33 resection of left adrenal gland with plane of dissection posterior to \nGerota’s fascia as clinically indicated is recommended. Spleen \npreservation is not indicated in distal pancreatectomy for adenocarcinoma, \nand an R0 distal pancreatectomy for adenocarcinoma mandates en bloc \norgan removal beyond that of the spleen alone in ≤40% of patients.380,381 \nSimilar to the Whipple procedure, lateral venorrhaphy, vein excision and \nreconstruction, and dissection to the level of the celiac axis and SMA \nadventitia should be performed if complete tumor clearance can be \nachieved.381,382 Utilization of these radical resections is associated with an \nincrease in blood loss, transfusion requirements, operating time, length of \nstay, and morbidity, but mortality remains rare.380-382 Encouragingly, tumor \nclearance (R0 resection) has been reported in up to 72% to 91% of \npatients, with long -term survival equivalent to those having standard \nresection for more localized disease.381,382 Local recurrence, however, \nremains problematic even with pathologically negative margins.382  \nThere is an increasing role for laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. A \nmeta -analysis including 29 observational studies with 3701 patients \nshowed that laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy may decrease \nintraoperative blood loss ( P < .01), time to first oral intake ( P < .01), and \nlength of hospital stay ( P < .01), as compared to open distal \npancreatectomy.383 Similarly, o ther stud ies found s ignificant benefits in \npatients  (N = 172) who had laparoscopic versus open distal \npancreatectomy  with reductions in blood loss, need for blood transfusions, \nand length of hospital or intensive care unit stay s without any difference in \noncologic outcomes .384,385 386 \nManagement of Neck Lesions  \nPancreas neck adenocarcinomas  are especially difficult to manage  since \nthese tumors are located anterior to the superior mesenteric vessels and \nPV. The precise extent of involvement often cannot be determined prior to \nsurgery; therefore, complex intraoperative decisions are required, and  the surgeon must anticipate this. Complexity of surgery for pancreas neck \ncancers is compounded by the frequent involvement of the SMV/ PV.387,388 \nSurgeons who operate on pancreas neck cancers must anticipate possible \nSMV/PV involvement and be prepared to manage it.  Depending on the \nextent of involvement, a pancreaticoduodenectomy extending to the left of \nthe SMV  (extended pancreaticoduodenectomy), a distal pancreatectomy \nextending to the right of the SMV  (extended distal pancreatectomy), or a \ntotal pancreatectomy may be required to obtain an R0 resection.388  \nPortal Vein R esection  \nVascular invasion has been a conventional contraindication to pancreatic \nresection.  Early attempts at resection and reconstruction of the SMA and \nSMV in the 1970s were associated with poor results in a few patients who \nunderwent “regional” pancreatectomy.389 Both autologous and synthetic \ngrafts were used for arterial and venous reconstructions. As morbidity from \npancreatoduodenectomy decreased, a subset of patients in need of \nresection of the SMV wall to achieve nega tive margins during removal of \ntheir tumors  were identified . Thus, in the 1990s, there  was renewed \ninterest in vein resection for complete resection . A single -institut ion \nexperience  has demonstrat ed that vein resection and reconstruction can \nallow for complete resection and is not associated with i ncreased \nmorbidity or mortality in comparison to cases where vein resection  was not \nrequired .390 Furthermore, long -term outcome is not significantly worse for \npatients undergoing  venous resection during pancreatoduodenectomy \ncompared to patients who receive standard pancreatoduodenectomy.391 \nAlthough compelling, this approach has not been universally accepted. \nDuring the 1990s, several studies reported operative mortality of 0% to \n16.5%, 3 -year Kaplan -Meier survival of 12% to 23%, and median survival \nof 5 to 14 months in patients receiving vei n resection.392-395 One study \nfound that properly selected patients with adenocarcinoma of the \npancreatic head who required vein resection (n = 141) had a median PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-34 survival of approximately 2 years that  statistically  did not differ from those \nhaving standard pancreatoduodenectomy and was superior to historical \ncontrols in which patients believed to have locally advanced disease did \nnot receive surgical treatment.376 A meta -analysis of 22 retrospective \nstudies ( N = 2890 ) found that , although R0 resection rates were lower, \nvein resection resulted in perioperative morbidity and mortality  equal to \nthat of standard resection.396 In a multi -institutional database analysis of \n492 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy , R0 resection rates \nwere no different between th ose who had vein resection compared to \nthose without venous involvement (66% vs. 75%; P = NS ).397 \nNevertheless, a few groups have recommended caution and use vein \nresection only for selected patients.  \nPylorus Preservation  \nStomach r econstruction options after pancreatoduodenectomy center on \npreservation of the pylorus.  Traverso and Longmire398 reported on the \nmodern use of pylorus preservation in 1978 . The hypothesis was that \npreservation would improve emptying and provide nutritional benefit, but \nthe advantages  have been inconsistent to date.  A systematic review \n(including eight  RCTs with 512 patients) showed no significant differences \nfor mortality, morbidity, and survival, but some perioperative measures (ie, \noperating time, intraoperative blood loss, red blood cell transfusion) were \nbetter in patients who received pylorus -preserving \npancreaticoduodenectomy, relative to those who received a classic \nWhipple  procedure .399 Though more data from high -quality RCTs are \nneeded,  pylorus -preserving pancreatoduodenectomy is an  acceptable \nalternative to classic pancreatoduodenectomy performed with antrectomy.  \nPancreatic Anastomosis  \nEfforts have focused on preventing pancreatic leaks and fistulas, which \nare morbid and potential lethal complications of pancreatoduodenectomy. \nPancreaticojejunostomy has traditionally been the standard reconstruction  method  and is the major focus of morbidity and mortality after \npancreatoduodenectomy  because of leaks, abscess formation, and \nfistulas from this anastomosis.  A randomized study found no difference in \nfistula rates after pancreaticojejunostomy and pancreaticogastrostomy .400 \nHowever, a multicent er, randomized superiority trial  (N = 329) showed a \nsignificant difference in postoperative fistulas, which occurred in 19.8% of \npatients in the pancreaticojejunostomy group vs. 8.0% of patients in the \npancreaticogastrostomy group (OR, 2.86; 95% CI , 1.38–6.17; P = .002) .401 \nAn increase in grade ≥3a  postoperative complications was seen, however, \nin the pancreaticogastrostomy  group ( 39 vs. 35 patients ). Although a \nmeta -analysis of four RCTs (676 patients) concluded that \npancreaticogastrostomy  is associated with a lower risk of fistula formation \nthan pancreaticojejunostomy  (RR, 0.41; 95% CI , 0.21–0.62),402 the optim al \napproach  to anastomosis remains based on the surgeons  experience , \npreference, and adherence to principles including good exposure and \nvisualization .403 \nSurgeons have also examined various other options , including end-to-end, \nend-to-side, duct -to-mucosa, and invaginating techniques , for \npancreaticojejunal anastomosis , which have all proven to be safe and \neffective .404,405 Results of a prospective trial show that pancreatic fistula \ncan be almost entirely avoided by combin ing placement/tying of sutures \nunder magnification with meticulous attention to blood supply .406 Stents \nused in the 1930s /1940s continue to be used today  with data suggest ing \nthat they do not decrease leak rates .407  \nTechnical modifications , such as  octreotide , have been examined for their \nability to decrease postoperative pancreaticojejunal leaks in patients \nundergoing pancreatic resections.  However, octreotide did not decrease \nfistula rates when assessed in two prospective, randomized, double -blind, \nplacebo -controlled studies .408,409 The use of fibrin glue sealant also does \nnot appear to decrease the rate of pancreatic fistulas.410 Pasireotide, in PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-35 contrast, significantly decreased the rate of grade ≥3 fistula, leak, or \nabscess in a single -center, double -blind RCT of 300 patients (9% in \npasireotide group vs. 21% in placebo group; RR, 0. 24; 95% CI, 0.24 –0.78; \nP = .006).411  \nExtended Lymphadenectomy   \nThe role of lymph node dissection as a component of \npancreatoduodenectomy has been explored . In the 1970s and 1980s, \npathology and autopsy studies demonstrated a high incidence of nodal \nmetastasis (sometimes as high as 80%), leading some groups to propose \na more aggressive lymphadenectomy  in an attempt to regionally control \ndisease .412,413 An extended lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing \npancreatoduodenectomy  entails removal of nodes at the duodenum and \npancreas , on the right side of the hepatoduodenal ligament  and SMA , and  \nthe a nterior and posterior pancreat oduodenal lymph  nodes .414 An \nextended lymphadenectomy  is most commonly performed in the United \nStates by removing not only the nodes  removed in the standard \nprocedure , but also soft tissue in the retroperitoneum from hilum of the \nright kidney to the left lateral border of the aorta on the right side , and from \nPV to origin of the inferior mesenteric  artery on the left.415 \nSeveral  prospective, randomized trials have address ed the role of \nlymphadenectomy in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy . The \nItalian Multicenter Lymphadenectomy Group report ed on a series of 81 \npatients randomly assigned to pancreatoduodenectomy with or without \nextended lymph node resection  (with low statistical power ) and did not \nsupport the concept that an extended lymphadenectomy was a good \nprognostic factor .416 A larger , randomized , prospective , single-institution \ntrial was performed  from 1996  to 2001  to evaluate the role of extended \nlymph node dissections .417 The group of patients who received regional \nlymphadenectomy in addition to pancreatoduodenectomy had longer \noperation times, but overall median survival did not differ between the two groups at 1, 3, and 5  years .417-419 A randomized multicenter trial in Japan \ncame to similar conclusions.420 Furthermore, multiple systematic literature \nreviews and meta -analyses of  RCTs comparing pancreatoduodenectomy \nwith standard versus extended lymphadenectomy support the conclusion \nthat the extended procedure does not have any impact on survival.421-423 In \nfact, a review of four prospective randomized trials and a meta -analysis \ninferred that  patients undergoing extended lymphadenectomy may have \nincreased rates of postoperative diarrhea compared to patients \nundergoing the standard resection.424 \nNo survival advantage has been found when performing a regional \nlymphadenectomy in addition to the standard pancreatoduodenectomy.425 \nData suggest that nodal metastases is a marker of systemic disease and \nthat their removal is unlikely to alter OS. One exception might be in the \nsituation of an otherwise R0 resection with clinically positive adenopathy \noutside the standard field of dissection. Overall, outside of a clinical trial , a \nregional lymphadenectomy should not be considered as a routine part of \nthe Whipple procedure , although consideration can be given to sampling \nof the aortocaval and common hepatic artery nodes, as those with po sitive \nnodes in these sites have inferior prognoses.426,427  \nPreoperative Biliary Drainage  \nThe main goals of preoperative biliary drainage are to alleviate the \nsymptoms of pruritus and cholangitis and potentially make surgery less \nmorbid by improving liver function preoperatively.  Although controversial, \nseveral studies suggest that pancreatoduodenectomy is associated with \nhigher perioperative mortality when performed  in the setting of \nhyperbilirubinemia .428-430 Stenting of the biliary system can improve \nsymptoms and liver function, but it is not clear whether these changes can \ndecrease the mortality rate associated with  the Whipple procedure. \nSeveral prospective and retrospective studies have not shown  decreased \nmortality in patients with preoperative biliary drainage .431-437 A PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-36 retrospective analysis of 593 patients treated with \npancreatoduodenectomy found that self-expandable metal stents did not \naffect  postoperative complications, 30 -day mortality, length of stay, \nanastomotic leak, margin  status , or determination of unresectability during \nresection, although  more wound infections and longer operative times  \nwere observed in this group.438 In contrast, a multicenter, randomized trial \nin 202 patients with cancer of the pancreatic head characterized by \nobstructive jaundice and comparing preoperative biliary drainage with \nsurgery alone , showed a nearly 2 -fold increase in the rate of serious \ncomplications in the stented group (74% vs. 39%; RR in the surgery alone \ngroup, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 –0.71; P < .001). However, no significant \ndifferences in surgery -related complications, length of hospital stay, or \nmortality were observed.90 \nBased on these reports, most groups who perform resection without \nneoadjuvant treatment advocate selective use of decompression only in \npatients who are symptomatic , septic , coagulopathic, have renal \ninsufficiency,  or in whom surgical resection is significantly delayed.  The \nPanel includes in this group p atients who present with jaundice and \npotentially resectable disease  if symptoms of cholangitis or fever are \npresent , or if they have significant pruritus with an expected delay to \nsurgery of >1 week.  \nFor patients with jaundice undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, biliary \ndecompression is necessary before  initiat ion of  therapy and appears to be \nwell-tolerated with minimal increase in perioperat ive morbidity. A single -\ninstitute experience  with more than 300 patients , 57% of whom had \npreoperative biliary drainage as part of a neoadjuvant chemoradiation \nprogram , found that wound complications were significantly increased in \nthe drainage group; however, no other association was found for sepsis, \nfistulae, or death.439 Stent p lacement is thus required  prior to \nadministration of neoadjuvant therapy for patients with jaundice.440-443 The Panel notes  that sten ts are an evolving technology. The choice of \nstents includes plastic and self-expanding metal (fully covered, partially \ncovered, or uncovered ). While any stent can become occluded, several \ngroups have reported better patency with metal stents .441,442 Since c overed \nmetal stents prevent tumor ingrowth,  they may give more durable patency  \nhowever migration may be an issue with these stents.444,445 However,  \nthere are no obvious  differences between covered and uncovered \nstents .444,445 This issue  has led to the introduction of partially covered \nstents , but these stents may still migrate in a substantial number of \npatients.446,447 Most metal stents used today are self -expanding. Their \nsmall initial diameter s make them easy to place and their placement  rarely \nrequire s dilation.448 Several institutions use plastic stents in patients with \nshort life expectancies  (<3 months) .449 In the absence of level  1 data, t he \nPanel consensus is that short, self -expanding metal stents (SEMS) are \npreferred because they are easy to place without dilation, unlikely to \ninterfere with the subsequent resection, and have a significantly longer \npatency rate than plastic stents. The Panel recommends that a fully \ncovered self -expandable metal stent be placed if tissue diagnosis has not \nbeen confirmed, as fully covered metal stents can be removed or \nexchanged .   \nEffect of Clinical Volume  \nThe fundamental premise of several studies that examined the effect of \ninstitutional volume on patient outcomes was that the decreasing morbidity \nand mortality seen in the 1980s and 1990s were the direct result of large , \nsingle -institution experiences. Moreover, the concern was that if surgeons \nperformed pancreatoduodenectomy less frequently , patients might have \nincreased morbidity and mortality.  A 1995 study  that includ ed a cohort of \nalmost 2000  patients  showed that  two high-volume centers in New York \nState had significantly less perioperative mortality than low -volume centers  \n(4% vs. 12.3%) .450 High volume , defined as >81 cases per year, correlated \nto perioperative mortality in a regression analysis.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-37 cases in New York State were performed in low -/minimal -volume centers.  \nSeveral other studies that assessed  regional outcomes with \npancreatoduodenectomy from U.S. and international hospitals  have \nreported decreased mortality, hospital length of s tay, and overall cost at \nhigh-volume centers  (or with surgeons who perform the resections \nfrequently)  when compared with low -volume centers.  451-458 \nThe definitions of high and low volume varied among all these  studies. \nHowever, a striking difference was seen when the mortality rates from \npancreatoduodenectomy in very-low-volume (0 –1 procedure/year ) and \nlow-volume (1 –2 procedures/year ) hospitals were  compared with rates in \nhigh-volume hospitals (>5 procedures/year ).459 The association  of hospital \nvolume and improv ed survival after pancreatic cancer surgery is even \nmore marked when pancreatoduodenectomy is compared to other major \nsurgeries . In a retrospective analysis of data from the national Medicare \nclaims database and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, hospitals \nperforming 6 to 16 and >16 pancreatic resections per year were classified \nas “high” and “very -high” volume centers.460 In this study, ≥6 pancreatic \nresections were performed at only 6.3% of hospitals. The largest \ndifference in operative mortality between very -low-volume ( 16.3%) and \nhigh-volume (3.8%) centers was specifically observed for pancreatic \nresections. These results  further reinforc ed the magnitude of effect that \nhigh-volume centers can specifically have on outcomes in patients with \npancreatic cancer .  \nA study involving 301,033 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma \nincluded in the NCDB that evaluated the treatment patterns of 1667 \nhospitals over a 19 -year period  showed that patients were more likely to \nreceive multimodality therapy at high-volume centers .461 In addition, a \nsystematic review showed that margin status correlates with hospital \nvolume, with negative margin rates ranging from 55% in low -volume \ncenters to 75.7% for very -high-volume centers ( P = .008).462 This review also found that 5 -year survival rates were superior  in high -volume centers. \nIn contrast, hospital readmission after pancreatoduodenectomy  appears to \nbe more of a function of patient characteristics than hospital or surgeon \nvolume.463 The Panel recommend s that pancreatic resections should be \nconducted at institutions that perform a large number (at least 15 –20) of \npancreatic resections annually.  \nPathology  \nMaking p rogress in pancreatic adenocarcinoma treatments is encumbered \ndue to variations , such as pathologic analysis and reporting,  among \ndifferent members involved in diagnosing and treating this disease .464 A \nstandardized approach could maximize the likelihood of more complete \nand consistent report s among pathologists in the same institution and \namong institutions around the world. Ultimately, a more consistent \napproach to patient assessment, surgical technique, and pathologic \nevaluation of the resected pancreatic specimen from gross examination to \nthe patholog y report will provide better communication among the various \nmembers of the patient  care team , including physicians . It will also provide \na clear and s pecific understanding of the individual  tumor characteristics , \nincluding critical margin status , allow ing for a more accurate assessment  \nof the existing and evolving treatment regimens for this lethal disease.  \nSpecimen Or ientation, Sectioning, Pathologic Analysis, and Reporting  \nThe primary purpose of pathologic analysis of the pancreatic specimen is \nto determine the pathologic stage of the tumor by evaluating the type, \ngrade, size , and extent of the cancer.  Pathology synoptic reports are \nuseful for reporting results from examinations of surgical specimens  and \nassist pathologists in providing clinically useful and relevant information. In \n2004, the Commission on Cancer ( CoC) of the American College of \nSurgeons mandated the use of specific checklist elements of the protocols \nas part  of its Cancer Program Standards for Approved Cancer Programs.  \nThe pathology synoptic reports from the College of American Pathologists PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-38 (CAP) comply with the CoC requirements, and are updated and revised \nregularly .465 The Panel currently supports the CAP pathology synoptic \nreports  and include s in the guidelines an abbreviated  minimum  analysis of \npancreatic cancer specimens from the CAP recommendations. Attached \norgans resected with the specimen en bloc require serial sectioning to \nassess not only direct extension, but metastatic deposits as well. In \naddition to the standard TNM staging, other variables are included, all of \nwhich have prognostic implications in disease evolution.466,467  \nLymph Node Counts and Lymph Node Ratio  \nA systematic review showed that the n umber of positive lymph nodes and \nlymph node ratio are associated with OS in patients with pancreatic \ncancer.468 The CAP recommendations include a count of the number of \nlymph nodes recovered and the number of involved nodes.465 \nRetrospective analyses show that patients with N0 disease have a better \nprognosis with an increasing number of examined lymph nodes.469-471 \nThese results suggest that a significant portion of patients with N0 disease \nmight be under staged . Based on these data, groups have recommended \nthe minimum number of lymph nodes examined to be from 11 to 17 to \nprovide optimal staging and to serve as a quality indicator.469,471,472 For \npatients with N1 disease, lymph node ratio (positive node/nodes \nexamined) appears to be related to prognosis .469-476 For instance, in one \nanalysis, patients with <15% of examined positive nodes had a 5 -year \nsurvival rate of 21.7%, while those with >15% positive nodes had a 5.2% \n5-year survival rate ( P = .0017).474 The Panel believes that e very effort \nshould be made to identify all regional lymph nodes within the \npancreatectomy specimen . \nWhipple Specimen  \nSpecimen orientation and inking involves both a pathologist and surgeon, \nas this will help to ensure accurate assessment of size and extent of the \ntumor. There should be either direct communication between the surgeon and pathologist for proper orientation and margin identification, or the \nsurgeon should identify the important margins with a clearly understood \nand documented method (ie, written on the pathology requisition). For \nexample, the distal and proximal margins of SMV and SMA, as well as the \nbile du ct margin, should be marked.  \nOne of the impediments to comparison of data across institutions is the \nvariability in the names given to various margins. Definitions of the \nmargins and uniformity of nomenclature are critical to accurate reporting. \nThe Panel’s recommended definitions are included in the Pathologic \nAnalysis: Specimen Orientation, Histologic Sections , and Reporting  \nsection of the algorithm. Margins defined include the SMA \n(retroperitoneal/uncinate) margin , posterior surface , SMA  groove margin , \ngastric/enteric  margins , pancreatic neck (transection) margin , and the b ile \nduct margin  (see Figure 2).  Other margins analyzed in Whipple specimens \ninclude the proximal and distal enteric margins (en face sections) and the \nanterior surface (closest represe ntative). The anterior surface is not a true \nmargin, but identification and reporting of this surface when positive may \nportend a risk of local recurrence, and is therefore strongly recommended \nbut not required to be reported in all cases.464,477 -479 Collectively, these \npancreatic tissue surfaces constitute the circumferential transection \nmargin. Designating the various specific margins with different colored \ninks will allow recognition on microscopy . \nThe approach to histologic sectioning  of a Whipple specimen  is \ndetermined by the unique characteristics of the tumor, but also influenced \nby institutional prefere nces, expertise, and experience. There is no one \ncorrect way to dissect a Whipple specimen. Options include axial, bi - or \nmulti -valve slicing , and perpendicular slic ing (see Figure 3) . Some experts \nin the field bisect the pancreas along probes placed in the bile and \npancreatic ducts and then serially section along each half of the pancreas. \nAxial s licing provides an overall assessment of  the epicenter of tumor PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-39 relative to the  ampulla, bile duct, duodenum and pancreas, and all of the \npancreatic circumferential tissue margins (see Figure 4).  \nThe most important aspects of dissection are clear and accurate \nassessment of the margins. It is currently unknown what constitutes an \nadequate margin in pancreatic carcinoma resection specimens. A \nstandardized definition would allow better stratification of patients into \nadjuvant regimens following surgical extirpation. For instance, if <1-mm \nclearance is associated with an unacceptably high incidence of local \nrecurrence, then strong consideration for postoperative RT , if not received \npreoperatively, might  be indicated. The Panel strongly recommends \nreporting tumor clearance in mm for all margins ( within 1.0 cm of tumor ) to \nallow prospective accumulation of these important data for future analysis.  \nA retrospective review found that  patients with R0 resections of close \nmargins (within 1 mm) had an improvement in OS (35 months vs. 16 \nmonths; P < .001 ) compared with  patients with wider margins (>1 mm ).480 \nIn fact, patients with close -margin R0 resections had a median survival \ntime similar to that of the R1 population (16 months vs. 14 months; P = .6). \nConsistent with these results, another retrospective review of 285 patients \nfound that those with R1 resections, defined as tumor ≤1 mm from the \nmargin, had a significantly worse local recurrence -free survival than those \nwith R0 resections (HR, 4.27; 95% CI, 2.07 –8.81).481 Additionally , a study \nusing a standardized pathologic protocol that involved multicolor inking \nand careful evaluation of multiple margins distances found that patients \nwith at least one positive inked margin  had a median survival of 17.7 \nmonths  versus  a median survival of 32.9 months in patients with R0 \nresections (P = .10).482 Together, these results suggest that an appropriate \ndefinition of a negative margin may be >1 mm.  \nDistal Pancreatectomy Specimen  \nIn left -sided resections , the peripancreatic soft tissue margins and the \npancreatic neck are assessed (see Figure 5). Additionally, involvement of the splenic vessels should be documented because  direct tumor invasion \nof the spleen constitutes a pT3 pathologic stage. Frozen section analysis \nof the pancreatic neck is a recommended  option . Definitions of  the \nproximal pancreatic (transection) margin , anterior (cephalad) \nperipancreatic (peripheral) surface , and p osterior (caudad) peripancreatic \n(peripheral) margin  are included in the guide lines.  \nPerioperative Therapy  \nEven with R0 resections, recurrence rates are very high in this disease. \nTherefore, additional therapy is required for all patients with resected \npancreatic adenocarcinoma.  \nPostoperative (Adjuvant) Therapy  \nResults of many trials have shown that adjuvant therapy improves \noutcomes over observation following resection. Results of RTOG 9704 \ncannot be directly compared with the results of the CONKO -001, \nESPAC -1, or ESPAC -3 trials because of differences in treatment design, \ntiming of imaging, and patient characteristics . For example,  patients \nenrolled in CONKO -001 were more likely to have negative lymph node s \nand positive resection margins than those in RTOG 9704 , whereas  \nCONKO -001 excluded patients with high posto perative CA 19 -9 or CEA \nlevels .208,289 Despite these differences, the  median OS for patients in the \ngemcitabine arm of CONKO -001 (22.8 months), the \ngemcitabine -containing arm of RTOG 9704 (20.5 months), the bolus \n5-FU/leucovorin arm of ESPAC -1 (20.1 months), and the gemcitabine and \n5-FU/leucovorin arms of the ESPAC -3 study (23.6 and 23.0 months) are \nremarkably similar.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-40 administered with erlotinib did not significantly improve OS or DFS  \ncompared to gemcitabine administered alone in the adjuvant setting.483 A \nphase II prospective trial with 22 patients with resected pancreatic cancer \nshowed that gemcitabine/cisplatin is feasible, with a median OS of 35.5 \nmonths and median recurrence -free survival of 16.7 months.484 \nBased on the data discussed above , no definite standard has been \nestablished in the adjuvant treatment of pancreatic cancer  at this time . The \nPanel-recommended adjuvant options  (for patients who did not receive \nprior neoadjuvant therapy ) for chemotherapy alone includ e \ngemcitabine/capecitabine (category 1, preferred), modified FOLFIRINOX \n(category 1 , preferred ), gemcitabine (category 1 , other recommended ), \n5-FU/leucovorin  (category 1 , other recommended ), or continuous infusion \n5-FU (other recommended) . Capecitabine monotherapy is also a \ntreatment option for the adjuvant setting (category 2B). G emcitabine , bolus \n5-FU/leucovorin , or continuous infusion 5 -FU before gemcitabine - or \nfluoropyrimidine -based chemoradiation with subsequent chemotherapy  \nare also recommended as adjuvant treatment  options . To date, no studies \nhave demonstrated superiority of giving chemoradiation before versus \nafter chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting.  For those who received prior \nneoadjuvant therapy, the optio ns for adjuvant therapy depend on the \nresponse to neoadjuvant therapy and other clinical factors.  Regardless of \nthe therapy being considered it is important to evaluate the patient for \nextent of disease prior to therapy , because some patients have early \nrecurrence within the first few weeks following surgery. In  addition, the \nPanel recommends restaging a patient with imaging following systemic \nchemotherapy if chemoradiation is planned.  \nA retrospective analysis of data from patients in the ESPAC -3 trial found \nthat completion , but no t the time to initiate treatment,  of the six-course \nchemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor  for survival.485 These \nresults suggest that delaying chemotherapy until patients fully recover  after surgery  could possibly allow for completion of the full chemotherapy \ncourse and improve outcomes. The Panel therefore recommends that \nadjuvant treatment should ideally be initiated within 12 weeks,  to allow for  \nadequate recovery from surgery.  \nResults of the phase III RCT JASPAC -01 trial ( N = 385), in which S -1, an \noral chemotherapy drug used in Japan , used in the adjuvant setting \nshowed greater median OS (46.5 months; 95% CI, 37.8 –63.7) compared \nto gemcitabine (25.5 months; 95% CI, 22.5 –29.6).486 Three - and 5 -year \nsurvival rates were 59.7% and 44.1%, respectively, for S -1, and 38.8% \nand 24.4%, respectively, for gemcitabine. S -1 was generally well -tolerated,  \nand patients were less likely to discontinue treatment compared to patients \nrandomized to receive gemcitabine ( P = .005). Grade 3 or 4 adverse \nevents that were more likely to be reported in patients receiving \ngemcitabine include d leucopenia, neutropenia, aspartate \naminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase, while stomatitis and \ndiarrhea were  more common in patients receiving S -1. \nResults of the PRODIGE 24/CCTG PA.6 phase III trial (n = 493) \ncomparing adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine versus \nmFOLFIRINOX to treat resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma in patients \nwith good PS have been published .487 The median follow -up was 69.7 \nmonths (95% CI, 67.0–73.9). The 5-year DFS rate was greater for \nmFOLFIRINOX (2 6.1% ; 95%  CI, 20.5–32.1) compared to gemcitabine \n(19.0% ; 95% CI, 14.3–24.3). The median OS ( 53.5 vs. 35.5 months, \nrespectively) and metastasis -free survival ( 29.4 months vs . 17.7 months, \nrespectively) were also greater for mFOLFIRINOX compared to \ngemcitabine.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-41 In the Event of Leucovorin Shortage  \nThere  is no specific data to guide management under these \ncircumstances, and all proposed strategies are empiric. The Panel \nrecommends several possible options to help alleviate the problems \nassociated with this shortage. One is the use of levoleucovorin, which is \ncommonly used in Europe. A dose of 200 mg/m2 of levoleucovorin is \nequivalent to 400 mg/m2 of standard leucovorin. Another option is for \npractices or institutions to use lower doses of leucovorin for all doses in all \npatients, since the Panel feels , based on several studies, that lower doses \nare likely to be as efficacious as higher doses. The QUASAR study , in \npatients with colorectal cancer,  found that 175 mg leucovorin gave similar \nsurvival and 3 -year recurrence rates as 25 mg leucovorin when given with \nbolus 5 -FU to patients as adjuvant therapy following R0 resections for \ncolorectal cancer.488 Another study in patients with metastatic colorectal \ncancer showed no difference in response rate or survival between those \nwho receiv ed bolus 5 -FU with either high -dose (500 mg/m2) or low -dose \n(20 mg/m2) leucovorin.489 Although 5 -FU doses were different in the two \narms, a  study in the 1980s  determined that there was no therapeutic \ndifference between the use of high - (200 mg/m2) or low - (20 mg/m2) dose \nleucovorin with bolus 5 -FU in the treatment of advanced colorectal \ncancer.490 Finally, if none of the above options is available, treatment \nwithout leucovorin would be reasonable. For patients who tolerate this \nwithout grade II or higher toxicity, a modest increase in 5 -FU dose (in the \nrange of 10%) may be considered.  \nPreoperative (Neoadjuvant)  Therapy  \nThe standard approach to therapy in patients with resectable disease has \nbeen postoperative treatment, with median survivals in the range of 20.1 \nto 23.6 months  under the most optimal clinical trial  conditions .208,288,290,357 \nHowever, it is becoming increasingly apparent that patients with borderline \nresectable disease, at a higher risk for R1 resections, potentially need a \ndifferent management approach. C ontemporary approaches to perioperative  treatment  have focus ed on neoadjuvant  therapy for patients \nwith borderline resectable disease with the goal of improving OS.348 \nNeoadjuvant therapy is also sometimes used in patients with resectable \ndisease, especially in those with high -risk features. The putative benefits \nof neoadjuvant therapy include : 1) increasing the likelihood that a higher \nproportion of patients with resectable disease  will receive chemotherapy \nand/or radiation ; 2) increas ing the likelihood of a margin -free resection by \ndown staging tumors ( ie, conversion to resectable  status ); 3) select ing \npatients with disease that is more stable or responsive to therapy  for \nsurgery ; and 4) treat ing micrometastases at an earlier stage .365,491 -493 \nMoreover, surgery following neoadjuvant treatment appears to be \nsafe.494,495 \nRetrospective analyses showed that relative to neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemoradiation is associated with better local \ncontrol, with no significant differences in survival.496 Chemoradiation \nfollowing chemotherapy is sometimes included in the neoadjuvant setting. \nDoses for neoadjuvant chemoradiation that have been reported include 36 \nGy in 2.4 Gy/fraction, or 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy/fraction.493,497 The \nrole of chemoradiation  with more active chemotherapy regimens needs to \nbe tested.  Practices vary with regard to neoadjuvan t chemotherapy and \nchemoradiation , and w hen feasible, treatment should be performed at or \ncoordinated through a high -volume center. The Panel strongly encourages \nparticipation in clinical trials . \nPancreatic protocol CT or MRI of the abdomen , and chest /pelvi s CT \nshould be  repeated following neoadjuvant therapy.  Retrospective studies \nsuggest that imaging characteristics may not be a reliable indicator of \nresectability in borderline resectable and locally advanced patients who \nhave received neoadjuvant therapy.498,499 Determinations of resectability \nand surgical therapy should be made on an individualized basis in a \nmultidisciplinary setting .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-42 there is a high likelihood of achieving an R0 resection. Surgery is ideally \nperformed 4 to 8 weeks after therapy.  Surgery can be performed more \nthan 8 weeks following therapy, but radiation -induced fibrosis may \npotentially make surgery more difficult. Importantly, results from \nretrospective studies suggest that radiographic response does not \ncorrelate with pathologic response  in patients with borderline resectable \ndisease .500,501 Therefore, if no apparent tumor shrinkage is observed after \nneoadjuvant treatment and no extrapancreatic progressive disease is \nevident , surgery should still be attempted.  \nNeoadjuvant Therapy in Borderline Resectable Disease  \nPatients with borderline resectable disease and no metastatic disease \nshould be considered for neoadjuvant therapy  followed by restaging and \nresection in patients without disease progression that preclud es surgery.  \nUse of neoadjuvant therapy in the setting of borderline resectable disease \nhas been a highly debated topic. Although there is no high -level evidence \nsupporting its use, most  NCCN  Member Institutions now prefer an initial \napproach involving neoadjuvant therapy, as opposed to immediate \nsurgery, for  patients with borderline resectable disease. Upfront resection \nin patients with borderline resectable disease is no longer recommended.  \nSeveral trials have shown that preoperative treatment of borderline \nresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma can be effective and \nwell-tolerated.502-507 Most of these were phase II trials and showed that \nneoadjuvant therapy in a small percentage of patients with borderline \nresectable disease allowed for tumor resection  and in one study R0 \nresection .503-505 In two retrospective studies , 31% to 35% of patients with \nborderline resectable disease who completed neoadjuvant therapy had R0 \nresections.508,509 A systematic review and meta -analysis of 19 cohort \nstudies found that patients with unresectable disease (including both \nborderline resectable and unresectable) undergoing neoadjuvant \nchemoradiation therapy had similar 1 -year survival outcomes as patients  who were initially deemed resectable , although there was an increased \nrisk of perioperative death .510  \nIt is important to note that no randomized phase III trials have compared \nneoadjuvant therapy in borderline resectable disease versus surgery \nwithout initial therapy . Although not  yet published, the results of \nNCT00557492 , studying neoadjuvant chemoradiation, are posted on \nclinical trials.gov . In addition, the Alliance A021101 trial ( NCT01821612 ), a \nsingle -arm pilot study , evaluat ed the safety and efficacy of FOLFIRINOX \nbefore capecitabine -based chemoradiation and surgery.  507 Preliminary \nresults including 22 patients , with borderline resectable disease,  from \nmultiple centers showed that median OS was 21.7 months, and 68% of \npatients underwent resection.507 Out of the 15 patients who underwent \nresection, all but one had microscopically negative margins, and two had a \ncomplete response. However, the number of grade 3 or higher adverse \nevents was considerable, with 64% of patients experiencing one of these \nevents. Other results with small patient cohorts  suggest that FOLFIRINOX , \nas a neoadjuvant regimen,  is a promising approach in patients with \nborderline resectable disease.511-513 Chemotherapy followed by SBRT may \nalso be safe and feasible in the neoadjuvant setting, and improve the \npotential for resection in patients with borderline resectable or locally \nadvanced disease.283,514 However, further studies are needed before \nSBRT is recommended as a treatment option for patients with borderline \nresectable disease.  \nNeoadjuvant Therapy in Resectable Disease  \nA retrospective study showed that patients who received neoadjuvant \ntherapy followed by resect ion had better OS than those with the same \npropensity score and received upfront resection (median survival 26 \nmonths vs. 21 months, respectively; HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68 –0.78; P < \n.01).515 A number of studies , trials , and retrospective analyses  have \nevaluated the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-43 resectable disease .516-524 A retrospective review of the coll ective single -\ninstitution experience  suggested  that preoperative chemoradiation therapy \nin patients with resectable disease provides an survival advantage .517 The \nauthors suggest that preoperative therapy gives a selection advantage \nbecause approximately 25% of patients who are restaged after therapy \nare found to have progressive disease and are therefore spared the \nmorbidity of a surgical procedure that would not benefit them.517 In this \nanalysis of 1 32 consecutive patients, the authors  reported that combined \npreoperative chemoradiation and pancreatoduodenectomy yielded a \nmedian survival of 21 months, and 31% of patients were alive without  \nevidence of disease  at a median follow -up of 14 months.517  \nOther potential advantages of the neoadjuvant approach in patients with \nresectable disease have also been described, including sterilization of the \nfield before resection potentially reducing spread during surgery , \nincreased rates of R0 resections , decreased incidence of pancreatic \nfistulas , prevention of delays or reductions of adjuvant therapy after \nsurgery , and improved delivery of chemotherapy and radiosensitizing \noxygenation.495,525 \nAlthough most  studies investigating the neoadjuvant experience in \npatients with resectable pancreatic cancer are retrospective, several small \nphase II studies have been published.495,526,527 A randomized phase II trial  \nevaluating the safety and efficacy of gemcitabine -based neoadjuvant \ntherapy for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer  found that  more \npatients receiving gemcitabine with cisplatin were able to undergo \nresection compared with those who received  gemcitabine  only.522  \nIn a prospective trial, preoperative radiation with concurrent gemcitabine \nwas administered to 86 patients with resectable disease, and patients \nwere restaged and evaluated for surgery 4 to 6 weeks following \ncompletion of neoadjuvant treatment.519 Although all patients were able to \ncomplete neoadjuvant therapy, only 73 (85%) patients were able to undergo surgery  at the time of restaging ; the majority of the remaining \npatients were precluded from undergoing a pancreatoduodenectomy due \nto disease  progression . Similar results were observed in another phase II \ntrial with 90 enrolled patients  (n = 79 who completed chemo -\nchemoradiation) ; 52 out of 79 patients were able to complete neoadjuvant  \ngemcitabine/cisplatin followed by gemcitabine -based chemoradiat ion \ntherapy underwent surgery.442 Most p atients precluded from surgery had \nadvanced disease at restaging. These results provide support for \nrestaging patients with abdominal (pancreas protocol), pelvi s, and chest \nimaging ; measuring CA 19 -9 levels ; and staging laparoscopy , if not done \npreviously,  before committing them to laparotomy after neoadjuvant \ntherapy.  \nAlthough evidence suggests that there may be a better chance of \nmargin -negative resection with preoperative therapy,528 randomized trials \ntesting this association are needed.  A randomized phase II trial, \nterminated early because of slow accrual, compared gemcitabine/cisplatin \nneoadjuvant chemoradiation  followed by surgery  with upfront surgery; both \narms received adjuvant chemotherapy.529 With only 66 patients eligible for \nanalysis, no significant differences were seen in R0 resection rate (52% \nvs. 48% , P = 0.81 ), (y)pN0 rate (39% vs. 30% , P = 0.44 ), or OS (25.0 \nmonths vs. 18.9 months , P = 0.79 ). All comparisons  favored the \nneoadjuvant arm, and no safety issues were noted. The phase III NEOPA \ntrial, with OS as the primary endpoint, was set to study  patients  with \nresectable pancreatic cancer and compared neoadjuvant gemcitabine \nchemoradiation therapy to upfront surgery in this population and was \nterminated early due to lack of recruitment.530,531 A randomized phase II \nstudy comparing mFOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel as \nneoadjuvant regimens following surgery showed that 76% completed \nperioperative therapy and of these 33% had a complete or major \npathologic response  following surgery .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-44 received any neoadjuvant therapy was not significantly different from \nhistorical data of patients with resectable disease receiving adjuvant \ntherapy .532,533 The GEMCAD 10 -03 trial enrolled a small number of \npatients and showed promising results in those  who received neoadjuvant \ngemcitabine and erlotinib followed by chemoradiation and then surgery.534 \nThere is limited evidence to recommend specific neoadjuvant regimens \nthat are not investigated as part of a clinical trial , and practices vary \namong the Panel with regard to the use of chemotherapy and \nchemoradiation.  \nAdjuvant Treatment After Neoadjuvant Therapy  \nFor patients who received neoadjuvant treatment , data supporting \nadditional therapy after surgery are  lacking. The consensus of the Panel is \nthat patients who have received neoadjuvant chemoradiation or \nchemotherapy may be candidates for additional chemotherapy following \nsurgery and multidisciplinary review. When chemotherapy is given, the \nchoice of regimen may be based on response seen  to neoadjuvant \ntherapy and other clinical considerations, such as PS and patient \ntolerability.  \nAdjuvant  chemo therapy or adjuvant chemoradiation , ideally initiated  within \n12 weeks,  should only be considered for  patients who have adequately \nrecovered from surgery  and have no evidence of recurrence or metastatic \ndisease. It is recommended that the patient undergo a pretreatment \nbaseline assessment  following surgery, including pancreas protocol CT \nscan (abdomen) and chest/pelvi s CT with contrast, CA 19 -9 level, and \ngenetic testing if not previously performed, to evaluate for the presence of \nmetastatic disease before adjuvant chemoradiation is initiated. Further, the \nPanel recommends restaging a patient with imaging after each treatment \nmodality , if it will precede ch emoradiation.  Neoadjuvant Clinical Trials  \nFor neoadjuvant trials, study populations should be well -defined and \nstandardized. The Panel endorses use of a restrictive definition of \nborderline resectable disease in clinical trials, such as that defined in an \nIntergroup trial.366 Endpoints should also be standardized by including \nresection rates, R0 resection rates, local recurrence rates, pathologic \nresponse rates, DFS, and OS.535 \nSurveillance  of Patients with Resected Disease  \nAlthough data on the role of surveillance in patients with resected \npancreatic adenocarcinoma  are very limited ,536,537 recommendations are \nbased on the consensus that  earlier identification of disease may allow  \npatient s to enroll  in investigational studies  or other forms of treatment. T he \nPanel recommends  history and physical examination for symptom \nassessment and chest CT and CT or MRI of abdomen and pelvis with \ncontrast (unless contraindicated) as appropriate . An analysis of the \nSEER -Medicare database showed no significant survival benefit  for \npatients who received regular surveillance CT scans.538 CA 19 -9 \ndetermination  is a category 2B recommendation because there are no \ndata on early treatment of recurrences  due to increased tumor marker \nlevels lead ing to better patient outcomes.   \nManagement of Recurrent Disease  After Resection  \nAs cross -sectional body imaging has improved, small -volume metastatic \ndisease or local recurrence s are being detected in patients with resected \npancreatic cancer who otherwise maintain good functional status. These \npatients  will, however,  ultimately progress .  \nFor patients experiencing a recurrence of disease following resection, the \nPanel recommends consideration of confirmatory biopsy (category 2B) , \ngenetic testing for hereditary mutations (if not previously done), or \nmolecular profiling of tumor tissues .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-45 in cases of pancreas only,  clinical trial is an option; p alliative an d best \nsupportive care without additional therapy is also an option, especially for \npatients with metastatic disease and poor PS. In a pooled analysis of 55 \npatients  (from 19 studies)  who underwent pancreatectomy for recurrent \npancreatic cancer, 1 -, 3-, and 5 -year survival rates were 82.2%, 49.2%, \nand 40.6%, respectively.539 Therefore, for patients with local disease \nrecurrence, surgical resection may be considered in select cases (ie,  \nlocation of recurrence is in the pancreas only). Chemoradiation can be \nconsidered in patients with local disease recurrence in the pancreatic bed, \nif radiation has not been previously administered, or a systemic \nchemotherapy regimen can be given. However, there are limited data to \nsupport specific RT recommendations for recurrent disease. For patients \nfor whom there is evidence of metastatic dis ease (with or without a local \nrecurrence), systemic therapy options are influenced by the length of time \nfrom completion of adjuvant therapy to the detection of metastases. If \nadjuvant therapy was completed <6 months prior to development of \nmetastatic disease, the Panel recommends that an alternative \nchemotherapy option be administered (eg, switching to a \ngemcitabine -based regimen if fluoropyrimidine -based therapy was \npreviously used, or vice versa). When  this period is ≥6 months, repeating \nsystemic therapy  as previously administered or switching to any other \nsystemic regimen are recommended  options .  \nManagement of Isolated Pulmonary Metastases  \nSome patients have isolated lung metastases after resection of localized \npancreatic adenocarcinoma. A growing body of evidence in this population \nsuggests that the lung is the most common site of recurrence in patients \nwho are followed 5 years after their first diagnosis .540 Preliminary \nretrospective data suggest that resections of isolated pulmonary \nmetastasis may be advantageous in this population.541 More data are \nneeded before recommendations can be made regarding the management \nof pulmonary metastases of pancreatic cancers.  Palliative and Supportive Care  \nA significant subset of patient s with pancreatic cancer will require  \nsubstantial palliative interventions that are, in many respects, unique to the \ndisease. The multidisciplinary management of symptoms due to biliary \nobstruction, gastric outlet obstruction, and cancer -related pain is of \nprimary importance. The main objectiv e of palliative care is to prevent and \nameliorate suffering while ensuring optimal QOL . Palliative surgical \nprocedures are best reserved for patients with longer life expectancies.  \nBiliary Obstruction  \nApproximately 65% to 75% o f patients with pancreatic cancer develop \nsymptomatic biliary obstruction.542 For patients diagnosed with \nunresectable disease and biliary obstruction upon initial evaluation, the \nbest palliation is provided by an endoscopic biliary stent, especially when \nanticipated survival is limited. In most cases, a permanent SEMS is \nrecommend ed unless biliary bypass was performed  at the time of \nlaparoscopy or laparotomy . Stent occlusion that causes recurrent \ncholangitis is a well -known complication of plastic (temporary) biliary \nstents and typically occurs within 3 months of insertion. Metal s tents are \nwider in diameter than plastic stents (ie, less likelihood of blockage) and \nbecome embedded in the bile duct, whereas plastic stents are more likely \nto become occluded but can be replaced. Results of an RCT of 100 \npatients at a single center rand omly assigned to receive either a plastic \nstent or a covered SEMS inserted endoscopically indicated that median \npatency times were 1.8 and 3.6 months ( P = .002), respectively.543 A \nmeta -analysis comparing metal and plastic biliary stents placed \nendoscopically in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma characterized \nby biliary obstruction showed similar results.544 This study suggested that \nthe risk of recurrent biliary obstruction was lower for the metal  stents (RR , \n0.52; 95% CI , 0.39–0.69) ; however , no significant differences in \ntechnical /therapeutic success, complications , or 30 -day mortality were \nfound .

An alternative is to sequentially dilate the duodenum \nendoscopically, place a metallic biliary stent, and then place an enteral \nstent , which has been shown to be safe and effective in the long term .546 \nDurable palliation of biliary obstruction can often be achieved with an \nexpandable metallic biliary endoprosthesis ( eg, Wallstent, Boston \nScientific)  in this situation.546  \nFor patients with jaundice and potentially resectable disease who are \nfound to have unresectable tumors following laparotomy, an open \nbiliary -enteric bypass provides durable palliation of biliary obstruction , \nwhich can be combined with procedures that palliate symptoms resulting \nfrom gastric outlet obstruction and cancer -related pain. The Panel \nrecommends stenting or an open biliary -enteric bypass with or without \ngastrojejunostomy (category 2B for prophylactic gastrojejunostomy547,548) \nand with or without celiac plexus neurolysis 549-551 (category 2B in patients \nwithout pain).  \nBiliary decompression is also required for jaundiced patients with disease \nprogression precluding surgery with o r without neoadjuvant therapy. Here, \nstenting or biliary bypass is recommended, with or without \ngastrojejunostomy , if clinically indicated,  and with or without celiac plexus \nneurolysis  (category 2B  in patients without pain ). One final circumstance \nrequiring biliary drainage is in jaundiced patients with locally a dvanced or \nmetastatic disease (those for whom surgical resection will not be \nattempted ). In this situation, a  SEMS is preferred unless biliary bypass \nwas performed at the time of laparoscopy or laparotomy.  If cancer has not been biopsy -confirmed in the setting of locally advanced disease  in a \npatient with jaundice, biopsy can be repeated  at the time of stent \nplacement.  \nGastric Outlet Obstruction  \nSymptomatic gastric outlet obstruction occurs in 10% to 25% o f patients \nwith pancreatic cancer.542 Patients with locally adva nced or metastatic \ndisease and a short life expectancy or poor PS who develop gastric outlet \nobstruction may be palliated with an endoscopically placed enteral stent \nafter biliary drainage is assu red.546 An alternative for these patients with \npoor PS is percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. \nFor a fit patient with a life expectancy >3 to 6 months (ie, locally advanced \ndisease) who develops gastric outlet obstruction, an open or laparoscopic \ngastrojejunostomy (duodenal bypass) with or without a jejunostomy (J) \ntube should be considered since it may provide more durable and effective \npalliation of gastric outlet obstruction than an enteral stent.552-554 \nPlacement of an enteral stent is particularly important in patients with poor \nPS and should be done after biliary drainage is assured.  \nFor patients with potentially resectable disease who undergo a laparotomy \nand are found to have unresectable disease, a gastrojejunostomy should \nbe performed as clinically indicated . The role of prophylactic \ngastrojejunostomy in otherwise asymptomatic patients , with unresectable \ncancers found at the time of laparotomy , has been evaluated. Two RCTs \nhave investigated the role of prophylactic gastrojejunostomy for \nunresectable periampullary cancer, the majority arising from the head of \nthe pancreas.547,548 In both studies, approximately 20% of patients who did \nnot undergo a prophylactic gastrojejunostomy developed late gastric outlet \nobstruction that required therapy. A meta -analysis found similar results, \nwith development of gastric outlet obstruction in 2.5% of patients in the \nprophylactic gastrojejunostomy group  and 27.8% of those not receiving \ngastrojejunostomy .555 In both studies, prophylactic retrocolic PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-47 gastrojejunostomy significantly decreased the incidence of late gastric \noutlet obstruction but did not extend the length of stay or increase \ncomplication rates, such as delayed gastric emptying.  \nSevere Tumor -Associated Abdominal Pain  \nMost patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer \nexperience cancer -related pain.551 General principles for cancer -related \npain management can be found in the NCCN Guidelines  for Adult Cancer \nPain (available at www.NCCN.org ). Patients with severe tumor -associated \nabdominal pain should be treated with around -the-clock analgesics. \nHowever, some patients will be unresponsive to analgesics or will \nexperience undesirable side effects. Because advanced pancreatic cancer \noften infil trates the retroperitoneal nerves of the upper abdomen, celiac \nplexus neurolysis should be considered ( category 2A only when indicated \nby pain in a patient with jaundice with unresectable disease found at \nsurgery). In several RCTs, celiac plexus neurolysis significantly improved \npain relief in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.549,551,556 In a study \nof 96 individuals with pain related to suspected pancreatic cancer, patients \n(n = 48) randomized to EUS -guided celiac plexus neurolysis at the time of \nEUS with confirmed unresectable  adenocarcinoma  reported better pain \nrelief at 3 months ( P = .01) .550 These results suggest that early \nEUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis may be beneficial. A meta -analysis of \nseven  RCTs  in patients with pancreatic cancer  concluded that celiac \nplexus neurolysis significantly improved pain scores at 4 weeks , which \nwas not maintained at 8 weeks.557 Another RCT measuring t he \neffectiveness of ethanol celiac plexus neurolysis for pain in resectable \npancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinoma found no significant impact \non postoperative pain (N = 467).558 Minimally invasive techniques \nincluding EUS -guided (preferred if available) and percutaneous \nfluoroscopic - or CT -guided celiac plexus neurolysis are recommended, but \nlaparoscopic, thoracoscopic, and open approaches can also be used.  In selected patients with severe local back pain  refractory to analgesic \ntherapy, palliative RT may be considered to ameliorate pain, bleeding, \nand/or local obstructive symptoms, in the settings of both metastatic and \nnon-metastatic disease, if not already given as part of primary therapy. In \nsuch cases,  radiation is given with or without concurrent chemotherapy to \nthe primary tumor plus a margin, or radiation alone is given to the \nmetastatic site. The dose used should take into account the burden of \ndiseas e, normal tissue tolerance, and expected survival.  \nPancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency  \nExocrine enzyme insufficiency in pancreatic cancer is caused by \ntumor -induced damage to the pancreatic parenchyma and/ or blockage of \nthe pancreatic duct, or by surgical removal of pancreatic tissue, and \nresults in an inadequate production of digestive enzymes.559,560 This \ndeficiency in pancreatic enzymes results in inadequate absorption of fat, \ncarbohydrates, and proteins, leading to steatorrhea, abdominal cramps, \nweight loss, and malnutrition.561 Pancreatic exocrine enzyme replacement \ntherapy is recommended for patients with pancreatic cancer who have \nsymptoms of exocrine enzyme deficiency. Because pancreatic exocrine \ninsufficiency occurs in >80% of patients undergoing pancreatic \nsurgery,562,563 enzyme replacement therapy may be initiated without \ndiagnostic tests. Enteric -coated mini -microspheres containing preparations \nof pancreatic enzymes are taken orally ( 25,000 –75,000  units  of lipase  for \na main meal and 10,000 –25,000 units of lipase for a snack, depending on \nfat content), with half of the dose taken  at the start of the meal and half \ntaken in the middle of the meal.561 A prospective , double -blind , phase II \nRCT including 67 patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer showed no \nsignificant difference in weight loss between patients randomized to \nreceive pancreatic exocrine replacement therapy or placebo.564 For \npatients with disease that does not respond to this therapy, doses of the \nenzyme preparation can be increased, and inhibition  of gastric  secretion  \nwith a p roton  pump inhibitor  can also be considered.561,562 Patients with a PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-48 clinical suspicion of  pancreatic exocrine insufficiency despite appropriate \nreplacement may need a more thorough nutritional evaluation  with a \nregistered dietitian when available . \nThromboembolic Disease  \nThe risk of developing venous thromboembolic disease is substantially \nincreased in patients with p ancreatic cancer .565,566 The Panel recommends \nlow-molecular -weight heparin (LMWH) as preferred therapy over warfarin \nfor patients with pancreatic cancer who develop a venous \nthromboembolism (VTE). Support for this recommendation comes from \nresults of two large, prospective, randomized clinical trials: CLOT and \nCONKO -004. In CLOT , investigation of patients with advanced or \nmetastatic cancer and VTE over a period of 6 months  showed a  2-fold \ndecrease in the incidence of recurrent VTE in patients treated with the \nLMWH, dalteparin, com pared with those treated with an oral \nanticoagulant.567  \nResults from the CONKO -004 trial showed that the cumulat ive incidence \nrates of symptomatic VTEs were lower in patients randomized to receive \nenoxaparin ( n = 160) relative to patients receiving chemotherapy only ( n = \n152) (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19 –0.83; P = .01).568 PFS and OS did not \nsignificantly differ between the two groups.  In a pilot trial conducted in \npreparation for the CONKO -004 trial, the risk of developing symptomatic \nVTE was significantly lower for patients in the LMWH arm of the study with \nno significant increase in bleeding observed in this group compared to \nthose not receiving enoxaparin.568 The Panel does not recommend \nprophylactic LMWH at this time, due to the lack of evidence regarding \nimpact on survival. Please see the NCCN Guidelines for \nCancer -Associated Venous Thromboembolic Disease  for more information \n(available at www.NCCN.org ). Bleeding From the Primary Tumor Site  \nGI bleeding in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is hard to study \nbecause it is uncommon , but can carry a serious prognosis.569 Various \ncauses of GI bleeding include segmental portal hypertension,570 gastric or \nduodenal ulcer erosion, and radiation -induced gastritis.569 Treatment \noptions for GI bleeding  should be used according to clinical judgment \nregarding the specifics of the patient’s case. Endoscopic techniques571 or \nRT,572 when other options are not feasible, may be an effective treatment \nfor GI bleeding. As a final attempt, upper GI bleeding may be stopped with \nangiography with embolization.573,574  \nOne study of 246 eligible patients with pancreatic cancer included 32 \npatients with GI bleeding of varying grade.569 The median OS of patients \nwith GI bleeding was 9 months and in patients without GI bleeding was \n14.5 months. Conservative care was given to patients with bad physical \nstate ( N = 11), endoscopic hemostasis was given to 20 patients, and \nangiography and embolization were given to 1 patient. Therapeutic \nendoscopy was successful in 37.5% of patients and angiography with \nembolization was successful in 1 patient. Overall, 10.2% (25 patie nts) \nsuccumbed due to bleeding. The average time from GI bleeding to death \nwas 31.5 days and the average OS rate was 10 months.  \nThe Panel recommends the following treatment options for bleeding from \nthe primary tumor site: therapeutic endoscopy, if clinically indicated; RT, if \nnot previously done; and angiography with embolization, if clinically \nindicated.  \nDepression, Pain, and Malnutrition  \nFor many patients , a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer may result in \nsignificant psychosocial distress , including anxiety, depression, and sleep \ndisturbances.575 In fact, the suicide rate in male patients with pancreatic \ncancer is reportedly about 11 times that of the general population.576 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:55:13 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \n \nMS-49 Empathetic discussion about the natural history of this disease and its \nprognosis and the provision of support and counseling both by the primary \noncology team and specialized services may help to alleviate this distress.  \nThe Panel recommends that patients be screened and evaluated for \ndepression and other psychosocial problems following the NCCN \nGuidelines  for Distress Management (available at www.NCCN.org ).  \nBecause pain and malnutrition are also prevalent in patients with \npancreatic cancer, t he Panel recommends that patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer receive a n utritional evaluation  \nwith a registered dietitian  and a formal evaluation by a Palliative Medicine \nService, when appropriate. Additional resources are detailed in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Palliative Care  and the  NCCN Guidelines for Adult Cancer \nPain (available at www.NCCN.org ). \nSummary  \nPatients with borderline resectable disease and select patients with \nresectable disease can undergo neoadjuvant therapy in the hopes of \nimproving the chances for an R0 resection. Patients with locally advanced \ndisease and good PS can undergo chemotherapy and chemoradiation or \nSBRT with second -line therapy if PS is maintained after progression. \nPatients with good PS presenting with metastatic disease can undergo \nchemotherapy and second -line therapy if PS is maintained after \nprogression.  Specific palliative m easures are recommended for patients \nwith advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma characterized by biliary or \ngastric obstruction, severe abdominal pain, or other tumor -associated \nmanifestations of the disease.  Overall, in view of the  relatively high \nlikelihood of poor outcome s for patients with all stages of pancreatic \ncancer, the NCCN Panel  recommends that investigational options be \nconsidered in all phases of disease management.
