N Engl J Med 2018;378:2386-\n2398 Garcia JS, et al. Blood 2023;142:Abstract 319. Lachowiez CA, et al. Blood Cancer Discov 2023;4:276-293 ) who have HMA-refractory disease . When used as \ncytoreduction for MDS in combination with an HMA, venetoclax has been ef fectively given for 14 days in monthly courses (Garcia JS, et al. Blood 2023;142:Abstract \n319). Emerging data have also shown utility of olutasidenib for treating patients with IDH1 mutations (Cortes J, et al. Blood 2023;142:Abstract 1872). Repeat ing the \nbone  of marrow evaluation after 1 to 2 cycles is important to clarify the recovery of hematopoiesis and potential requirement for further therapy . \nMS-1\n• The discussion section has been updated to reflect the changes in the algorithm.\nUpdates in Version 1.2025 of the NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes from Version 3.2024 include:\nGeneral\n• References updated throughout the Guidelines.\n• \"Or relapse\" added to \"no response\" throughout algorithm. \n• Footnote ee added to \"or relapse\" throughout algorithm: Reevaluation with bone marrow and/or molecular testing is recommended. \nMDS-1\n• Initial evaluation, bullet 4, previous bullet moved as last sentence: Genetic testing for somatic mutations (ie acquired mutations) in genes associated \nwith myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).\nMDS-1A\n• Footnote b modified: See Table of Common Cytogenetic Abnormalities (MDS-A [4 of 5]).

Cytopenias are defined as values \nlower than standard lab hematologic levels, being cognizant of age, sex, ethnic, and altitude norms. Greenberg PL, et al. Blood 2016;128:2096-2097. For \ndiagnostic features of primary and therapy-related MDS that require cytopenia(s) and hematopoietic cell dysplasia, see MDS-A (1 of 5).\nb If standard cytogenetics (with ≥20 metaphases) cannot be obtained, a chromosome microarray analysis (CMA; also known as chromosome genomic array \ntesting [CGAT]) or MDS-related fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panel should be performed. If karyotype is normal, then consider CMA. Note that CMA \nwill detect not only somatic but also constitutional (germline) changes. See Table of Common Cytogenetic Abnormalities in MDS (MDS-A [4 of 5]).\nc If MDS is read out by the evaluating pathologist, reflex testing including cytogenetics and molecular testing should be performed as a standard practice. A \nunified report that includes molecular-genetic results with pathological description is required for appropriate diagnosis and therapy selection. See Table of \nCommon Cytogenetic Abnormalities in MDS (MDS-A [4 of 5]).\nd Bone marrow or peripheral blood cells should be assayed for MDS-associated gene mutations using gene panels that include genes listed on MDS-C. These \ngene mutations can establish the presence of clonal hematopoiesis, which can help exclude benign causes of cytopenias in cases with non-diagnostic \nmorphology, but do not establish a diagnosis of MDS in the absence of clinical diagnostic criteria (see Genes Frequently Somatically Mutated in MDS [MDS-C] \nand Discussion). As clonal hematopoiesis is a frequent consequence of aging, the finding of mutations in MDS-associated genes should be interpreted with \ncaution and does not in isolation establish a diagnosis of MDS. The majority of patients with WHO-defined MDS have a somatic mutation detected in one of the \ncommonly mutated MDS-associated genes. See Table of Common Cytogenetic Abnormalities in MDS (MDS-A [4 of 5]).\ne RBC folate is a more representative measure of folate stores and is the preferred test to serum folate. Serum methylmalonic acid testing is an accurate way to \nassess B12 status and is mandatory to the vitamin B12 evaluation, particularly for patients with possible pernicious anemia.\nf A heritable hematologic malignancy predisposition syndrome may account for cytopenias with or without MDS in some patients, whether presenting to \npediatric or adult care centers (eg, GATA2 deficiency syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, telomere biology disorders). Functional laboratory studies \nand constitutional (germline) genetic testing using large next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels to include genes listed on MDS-E, whole exome or \nwhole genome sequencing complemented with in silico copy number variant (CNV) calling, and/or laboratory analysis for CNVs, such as microarray testing \nare recommended for patients as shown on MDS-D (1 of 6). See Genetic Familial High-Risk Assessment: Hereditary Myeloid Malignancy Predisposition \nSyndr omes (MD S-D) and Gene Mutations Associated with Hereditary Myeloid Malignancy Predisposition Syndromes ( MDS-E). \ng In patients <40 y, CSA is due to disordered mitochondrial heme synthesis, often with distinctive mutational and clinical features. Some of these patients will \nhave disease that responds to pyridoxine or thiamine. CSA is not MDS (Fleming MD. Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program 2011;2011:525-531). CSA \nmay appear late due to lyonization in X-linked sideroblastic anemia.\nh Confirm diagnosis of MDS according to WHO/International Consensus Classification (ICC) criteria for classification (MDS-A) with application of International \nPrognostic Scoring System (IPSS) or revised IPSS (IPSS-R) (MDS-B 1 of 4). The percentage of marrow myeloblasts based on morphologic assessment \n(aspirate smears preferred) should be reported. Flow cytometric estimation of blast percentage should not be used as a substitute for morphology in this \ncontext. In expert hands, expanded flow cytometry (FCM) may be a useful adjunct for diagnosis in difficult cases (see Initial Evaluation in the Discussion).\ni Patients with karyotypes t(8;21), t(15;17), or inv(16) are considered to have AML even if the marrow blast count is less than 20%.

Evaluation \nof mutations should include sequencing or panels incorporating the most frequently mutated MDS-\nrelated genes as noted on MDS-C. Somatic mutations in more rarely mutated genes can also \nprovide evidence for CHIP or CCUS.\nm Patients with pathogenic mutations with >10% VAF AND ≥2 somatic mutations, spliceosome gene \nmutations, or mutations of RUNX1  or JAK2 have positive predictive values for myeloid neoplasms \n(MDS, MPN, or AML). Isolated mutations of DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 have less predictive value.\nn DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, RUNX1, JAK2, PPM1D, TP53, and splicing factor genes are the most \nfrequently mutated genes associated with CHIP.\no Myeloid neoplasm risk is increased 3-, 37-, and 348-fold in low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk \nCHIP/CCUS, respectively, compared to unmutated controls.1\np To facilitate clonal hematopoiesis risk score (CHRS) adoption, an online calculator is available \nand should be considered by the clinician evaluating the patient1: http://www.chrsapp.com. The \ncalculator returns a score with its corresponding risk category as low (CHRS ≤9.5), intermediate \n(CHRS 10–12), and high (CHRS ≥12.5). The three risk strata significantly differ in the 10-year \nprobabilities of myeloid neoplasms and overall survival for relevant clinical discussions and follow-\nup. The CHRS may have a role in clinical decision-making but requires confirmatory evidence to \nhelp assess its efficacy. Another method has also been reported to aid in the prediction of clonal \nhematopoiesis to myeloid neoplasm.5Feature CHIP ICUS Lower-Risk CCUS High-Risk CCUS\nCytopenia(s) - + + +\nDysplasia - - - -\nClonality + - + +\nRisk of \ntransformation+ +/- +++++\nClinical approach Observation; \nMonitor based on \nclinical changeObservation; \nMonitor yearlyObservation; \nMonitor yearlyObservation; \nMonitor 2–4x/year CBC; \nconsider clinical trialSPECTRUM OF INDOLENT MYELOID HEMATOPOIETIC DISORDERSj-p,1-4\nCHIP: clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential; ICUS: idiopathic cytopenia of unknown significance; CCUS: clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance\nMDS-21 Weeks LD, et al.

Pre-transplant debulking therapy to reduce marrow blasts to <5% with \nthe goal of reducing post-transplant relapse (see footnote yy and Discussion ) \nis recommended, although the optimum strategy (ie, azacitidine, decitabine, \ninduction-type chemotherapy) has not been determined. To reduce the disease \nburden pre-transplant is particularly important in patients who will receive a \nreduced-intensity conditioning regimen (Festuccia M, et al. Biol Blood Marrow \nTransplant 2016;22:1227-1233). At some centers, failure to achieve <5% blasts \nwith cytoreduction should not preclude patients from proceeding to transplant, \nas these patients appeared to derive survival benefit from transplant (Nakamura \nR, et al. J Clin Oncol 2021;39:3328-3339; Schroeder T, et al. Biol Blood Marrow \nTransplant 2019:25;1550-1559). Strategies for patients with specific mutations \nare under investigation. Patients with TP53 mutations, particularly biallelic, have \na poor prognosis even with transplantation. These cases should be discussed \nwith a transplant physician and patients should be enrolled in a clinical trial \nwhenever possible.yy Azacitidine, decitabine, or oral decitabine and cedazuridine should be continued \nfor at least 4–6 cycles to assess response to these agents. In patients who have \nclinical benefit, continue treatment with the HMA as maintenance therapy. While \nthe response rates are similar for both drugs, survival benefit from phase lll \nrandomized trials is reported for azacitidine and not for decitabine. \nzz Some emerging data have shown efficacy of novel agents, including venetoclax \nin combination with HMA with or without ivosidenib to target mIDH1 in patients \nwith myeloid malignancies including higher-risk MDS (Garcia JS, et al. Blood \n2023;142:Abstract 319. Lachowiez CA, et al. Blood Cancer Discov 2023;4:276-\n293). When used as cytoreduction for MDS in combination with an HMA, \nvenetoclax has been effectively given for 14 days in monthly courses (Garcia \nJS, et al. Blood 2023;142:Abstract 319). Emerging data have also shown utility \nof olutasidenib for treating patients with IDH1 mutations (Cortes J, et al. Blood \n2023;142:Abstract 1872). Repeating the bone marrow evaluation after 1 to \n2 cycles is important to clarify the recovery of hematopoiesis and potential \nrequirement for further therapy.\naaa A 20% blast cut-off for AML evolving out of MDS (AML-MDS) and MDS-\nEB2 may be arbitrary in some clinical scenarios. AML-style therapies may be \nconsidered for appropriate patients with MDS-EB2, especially at younger ages \nof presentation. Furthermore, a diagnosis of AML may be made with less than \n20% in patients with certain cytogenetic abnormalities per ICC (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Acute Myeloid Leukemia ). Some clinical trials designed for high-\ngrade MDS may allow enrollment of patients with AML-MDS (Estey E, et al. Blood \n2022;139:323-332, DiNardo CD, et al. Cancer 2022;128:1568-1570). Per recent \ncommunications, some patients with higher risk disease with WHO 2022 MDS-\nIB2 and ICC MDS/AML could be considered for AML-type therapy (Khoury JD, et \nal. Leukemia 2022;36:1703-1719; Arber DA, et al. Blood 2022;140:1200-1228).bbb The addition of venetoclax is based on patient status and tolerance. ccc High-intensity chemotherapy: Clinical trials with investigational therapy \n(preferred); or standard induction therapy if investigational protocol is unavailable \nor if it is used as a bridge to HCT.ddd Treatment failure would be considered if no response within 3–6 months. \nResponse should be evaluated based on IWG criteria: Cheson BD, et al. Blood \n2006;108:419-425; Zeidan AM, et al. Blood 2023;141:2047-2061.\neee For HMAs, if no response within 6 cycles of azacitidine or 4 cycles of decitabine \nor oral decitabine and cedazuridine.\nfff Consider second transplant or donor lymphocyte infusion immuno-based therapy \nfor appropriate patients who had a prolonged remission after first transplant.\nMDS-7AFOOTNOTES FOR MDS-7PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

Proliferative CMML \n(white blood cell [WBC] count >12,000/mm3) has a worse prognosis than the dysplastic subtype. \n• Mutational findings are listed in the table on MDS-A (3 of 5) with a major consistency in CMML, indicating ASXL1 as being an adverse \nprognostic feature.\n• Therapeutic approaches in CMML have generally been the model for treating the other MDS/MPN, with HMA ± venetoclax treatment for \npatients with intermediate- and higher-risk disease, and using these agents as a bridge to allogeneic HCT for those patients deemed to be \ntransplant-eligible. The trajectory of disease progression may differ in the disparate clinical entities based on their underlying molecular \nfeatures. Thus, expectant clinical monitoring is needed to assess potential change in patient's clinical status, needing altered management \nof the disorder. \n• Transplant eligibility principles include patients having fit performance status, their age, and having a donor. \n• Treatment response criteria for CMML have been developed by an international consortium of investigators.\n• Patients with CMML may have systemic mastocytosis with associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN) with a KIT D816V mutation in the \nneoplastic monocytes and mast cells. These patients may have marked hepatosplenomegaly, mast cell activation symptoms, or cutaneous \nlesions with elevated serum tryptase levels. The mastocytosis may be responsive to midostaurin treatment. Each disease should be treated \nindependently depending on its severity, being aware of drug-drug interactions.  \n\u0017Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has low sensitivity for KIT D816V mutation, and allele-specific PCR is more sensitive and recommended \nin patients with high clinical suspicion of mast cell disease. Arock M, Sotlar K, Akin C, et al. KIT mutation analysis in mast cell neoplasms: \nrecommendations of the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis. Leukemia 2015;29:1223-1232. See NCCN Guidelines for \nSystemic Mastocytosis.\n\u0017cKIT-directed therapy should be considered for systemic mastocytosis (Bose P, Verstovsek S. Avapritinib for systemic mastocytosis. \nExpert Rev Hematol 2021;14:687-696).\n• About 10%–20% of patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) skin lesions are associated with or develop into \nother myeloid neoplasms, including CMML, MDS, or AML (Facchetti F, et al. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. In: Swerdlow SH, \net al. Revised 4th ed. Lyon: IARC Press; 2017:173-177). Therefore, an accurate pathologic diagnosis is important for patients to receive the \nbest care. Tagraxofusp has been demonstrated to be a potentially useful therapy for these patients (Pemmaraju N, Lane AA, Sweet KL, et al. \nTagraxofusp in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic-cell neoplasm.

Other mutations (not \nlisted in the table below) in these genes can occur in MDS. Additionally, some of these mutations can occur in the context of aging and do not in isolation establish a \ndiagnosis of MDS, nor does the absence of mutations in these genes exclude a diagnosis of MDS in the correct clinical context.\nContinueda  The specific mutations listed in this table are likely to be somatic if found in tumor \nmaterial. Their absence in non-hematopoietic tissues would be required to prove \nthat they are acquired. Known gene polymorphisms frequent in the population \nshould be excluded from DNA sequencing results as they are likely germline \nvariants and not evidence of clonal hematopoiesis. b  There are microdeletions that would be missed by typical genetic sequencing or \nkaryotype that affects some of the same genes that may be indicative of clonal \nhematopoiesis.c Somatic mutations in several MDS-associated genes (eg, TET2, DNMT3A, TP53) \ncan occur in non-disease states and no gene mutation is diagnostic of MDS. \nMutations in several genes can occur in neoplasms other than MDS, including \nlymphoid malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute \nlymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Mutations should not be used as presumptive \nevidence of MDS when diagnostic criteria for MDS have not been met. d  Constitutional (germline) mutations in these genes can occur and cause a hematopoietic \nphenotype. Mutations identified in testing blood or marrow for somatic mutations associated \nwith MDS can identify constitutional (germline) mutations. Distinguishing constitutional from \nsomatic mutations often requires sequencing DNA from a non-hematopoietic tissue in MDS. \ne Mutation type definitions: Nonsense – a mutation that changes an amino acid codon into a \npremature stop codon. Frameshift – the insertion or deletion of DNA  base pairs that changes \nthe amino acid reading frame. Missense – a mutation that changes one amino acid codon \ninto another (eg, K700E indicates that the lysine [K] at codon 700 was mutated to a glutamic \nacid [E]). If no new amino acid is specified for a codon in the table, then it may be mutated \ninto one of several possible amino acids (eg, R882 indicates that the arginine [R] at position \n882 can be mutated in more than one way). Splice Site – a mutation that alters the first or \nsecond bases immediately before or after an exon.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

If no new amino acid is specified for a codon in the table, then it may be mutated \ninto one of several possible amino acids (eg, R882 indicates that the arginine [R] at position \n882 can be mutated in more than one way). Splice Site – a mutation that alters the first or \nsecond bases immediately before or after an exon.f Consider consulting a rheumatologist. JAK2 inhibitors and/or HMAs may potentially be used \nfor these patients.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

Early referral to a transplant center and early HCT donor identification should be considered.\n• Constitutional mutations predisposing to myeloid malignancy can occur without clinical stigmata of an inherited disorder or family history \ndue to phenotypic heterogeneity, which reflects overlapping features between inherited syndromes and also variable expressivity within \na syndrome. Also, a concerning family history of an inherited disorder is not expected in patients in whom the disease-causing mutation \noccurred de novo. Additionally, as there can be genetic anticipation in the short telomere syndromes, a child may be clinically affected, and \nthe genetically affected parent clinically unaffected or less severely affected.\n• Patients harboring these constitutional mutations can present to both pediatric and adult care centers. For example, patients who are \nolder harbor germline predisposition mutations may demonstrate longer latency for disease development, as seen with germline DDX41  \nmutations.9 Patients <50 y with MDS and those with therapy-related myeloid malignancies may be more likely to harbor germline variants in \nthese cancer predisposition genes.10,11,12\nMDS-D\n2 OF 6ContinuedReferences on MDS-D 6 of 6PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

Appropriate DNA source for germline genetic testing\n• When clinically possible, cultured skin fibroblasts are the recommended DNA source for germline testing in order to exclude somatic mutations and \nto avoid false negatives due to peripheral blood/marrow somatic mosaicism or somatic genetic reversion events.13,14,15\n\u0017Utilizing skin fibroblasts upfront (as opposed to initial testing of DNA from blood or marrow) may avoid unnecessary treatment delay, effort, cost, \nand anxiety surrounding counseling patients regarding possible inherited variants detected on tumor-only testing that subsequently proves to be \nacquired.\n\u0017Buccal samples can be considered, acknowledging the risk of peripheral blood contamination.\n\u0017Peripheral blood during disease remission may be considered with the limitation that acquisition of a dominant revertant clone can occur in \nindividuals with germline mutations. In this setting, genetic testing of blood/marrow-derived DNA could miss the germline mutation (eg, germline \nmutations in SAMD916 or SAMD9L).14,16,17\n\u0017See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal, Endometrial, and Gastric for information about constitution \nmismatch repair deficiency. \n\u0017See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic and Prostate for information about Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome. \n3.  Consideration of the appropriate genetic testing methodologies and other diagnostic testing\n• Multigene testing (aka NGS-based panel testing)\n• Accurate interpretation of germline (or somatic) mutation testing is essential for effective medical care.\n• As commercially available tests differ in the specific genes analyzed, variant classification, and other factors, it is important to consider the \nindication for testing and the expertise of the laboratory when choosing the specific laboratory and test panel.\n\u0017The interpretation of genetic testing remains subjective and complex. Interpretations may differ by laboratory. Mutations may be reclassified as \nadditional data emerge in the field (ie, mutations initially deemed pathogenic may be reconsidered and reclassified as nonpathogenic or vice \nversa).\n• Mutations identified in testing blood or marrow for somatic mutations associated with MDS can identify constitutional (germline) mutations, but \nsomatic panels are often not comprehensive and so a negative somatic panel does not rule out a constitutional mutation.18,19 \n• Genetic testing performed to identify somatic mutations arising in malignant cells is often not designed to detect germline (that is, inherited) \nmutations and may thus be inadequate for evaluation of an underlying heritable hematologic malignancy predisposition syndrome. Specifically, \nsomatic mutation panels may not target the relevant genomic locus and/or detect relevant copy number aberrations implicated in inherited \ndisorders.18\n• NGS and chromosome genomic array testing (CGAT) are complementary in detecting both mutations and copy number aberrations and copy-\nneutral LOH (cnLOH) in genes associated with these disorders.\n• Additional laboratory testing can assist in diagnosing these disorders.\n\u0017Fanconi anemia (FA) is evaluated by chromosome breakage analysis.\n\u0017Serum pancreatic isoamylase (pediatric and adult patients) and serum trypsinogen (pediatric patients) are often low in Shwachman-Diamond \nsyndrome.\n\u0017Short telomere syndromes, such as dyskeratosis congenita, demonstrate shortened telomere lengths, which can be measured by fluorescence \nin situ hybridization (FISH) assays using leukocyte subsets, although in patients who are older telomere length results may not be sensitive or \nspecific and may require complementary genetic evaluation to aid in interpretation.20,21\n\u0017Erythrocyte adenosine deaminase is often elevated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.22GENETIC FAMILIAL HIGH-RISK ASSESSMENT: HEREDITARY MYELOID MALIGNANCY PREDISPOSITION SYNDROMES\nMDS-D\n4 OF 6ContinuedReferences on  MDS-D 6 of 6PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

Post-test counseling done when the test results are disclosed\n• Discuss results and associated medical risks.\n• Interpret results in context of patient’s presentation.\n• Discuss recommended medical management.\n• Discuss and help to facilitate education and testing of family members at risk for heritable malignancy predisposition syndrome.\n• Discuss available resources such as high-risk clinics, disease-specific support groups, and research studies.\n• For patients of reproductive age, advise about options for prenatal diagnosis and assisted reproduction, including pre-implantation genetic \ntesting.\n• Consider carrier status implications of autosomal recessive disorders.\n5. Limitations of the proposed approach\n• The current criteria are focused on known genetic predisposition syndromes for MDS or AML. The proposed age threshold of 50 y at \ndiagnosis is arbitrary and may miss some patients with underlying heritable risk. A notable example of this is DDX41 . Germline DDX41 \nvariants have been reported in ~2% to 6% of unselected adult patients with myeloid malignancy ,23,24,25 which makes DDX41 one of the most \ncommon predisposition genes for myeloid malignancy in adult patients. These patients are commonly diagnosed with their AML/MDS after \n50 y. Additionally, likely not all genetic predisposition syndromes have been defined and so the current criteria for testing may change over \ntime. Any clinical suspicion of hereditary predisposition warrants a referral to an institution with expertise in the field.\n• Initial testing: Telomere length measurement by flow-FISH to assess the risk of telomere-mediated disease in patients with hematologic \nmalignancies where there are circulating malignant cells may be confounded or falsely shortened secondarily due to the malignancy itself. \nIn such cases, germline genetic assessment should be performed in lieu of telomere length measurement and telomere length measurement \nshould be assessed during remission where possible. In some cases of familial disease, assessment of telomere length in a relative with \nan identical variant in a telomere gene could also be used for interpreting the significance of the variant (optional). Additionally, if there are \ncirculating malignant cells or the malignant cell composition in peripheral blood is unknown, the finding of abnormally short telomere length \nmeasurement alone should be interpreted with caution and additional evidence of a telomere-mediated process is needed including the \npresence of a germline variant of clinical features including a family history of pulmonary fibrosis. \n• In the absence of a genetically confirmed heritable hematologic malignancy predisposition syndrome, a concerning personal/or family \nhistory may warrant consideration of an unrelated over a related donor for allogeneic HCT.\n6. Surveillance\n• Individuals who fulfill the clinical diagnostic criteria for a myeloid neoplasm with a germline predisposition should undergo surveillance, \neven if the pathogenic genetic variant is undetermined.\n• Individuals with a deleterious or likely deleterious genetic variant associated with a germline predisposition should undergo surveillance, \nregardless of clinical presentation.\n7. Managment considerations\n• The presence of a syndrome with noted high penetrance of myeloid malignancy or high-risk findings (such as somatic 2nd hit of RUNX1 , \nDDX41 , CEBPA, or biallelic TP53 loss) warrants timely referral to an academic center for assessment by a team with expertise in HMMPS and \nHCT evaluation for appropriate timing.GENETIC FAMILIAL HIGH-RISK ASSESSMENT: HEREDITARY MYELOID MALIGNANCY PREDISPOSITION SYNDROMES\nMDS-D\n5 OF 6References on MDS-D 6 of 6PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

For example, a combination using anti-CD45, -CD34, -CD33, and -CD19 (with forward scatter and side scatter) \ncould be useful. \n\u0017It is understood that the blast percent for both diagnosis and risk stratification should be determined by morphologic assessment, not \nsolely by FCM. If blasts are increased and morphologic questions arise regarding their subtype (ie, myeloid or lymphoid), they should be \ncharacterized with a more elaborate panel of antibodies.\n\u0017In diagnostically difficult cases, in expert hands, an expanded panel of antibodies to demonstrate abnormal differentiation patterns or \naberrant antigen expression may help confirm diagnosis of MDS (see Initial Evaluation  in the Discussion). \n\u0017Flow cytometric abnormalities are often seen in MDS, and in some cases may correlate with observed morphologic abnormalities. \nThey may also help diagnostically in patients with clinical suspicion of MDS who have no significant morphologic dysplasia and whose \nchromosome/FISH studies are either negative or normal. \n\u0017FCM is most useful in detecting aberrant immature myeloid lineages often observed in MDS.1-6 Flow analysis will detect aberrant \nexpression of B- or T-cell antigens on myeloid precursors, and selective loss or gain of additional markers (eg, loss or dim expression \nof CD33, CD34, CD56, CD38, or CD117) on myeloid precursors. Flow will help in cytopenia associated with LGL expansion by detecting \nincrease of CD56/CD57+ cells. CMML-associated monocytic aberrancies can be easily detected by a combination of CD64/CD14, and \nCD16 loss or dim6 expression. In addition, qualitative abnormalities in mature myeloid lineages, eg, hypogranular late myelocytes, bands/\nPelger-Huet cells, and neutrophils will have abnormal flow patterns (low or negative for CD16 or CD10). However , the erythroid lineage \ndysplasia (dyserythropoiesis) detection by FCM is limited4,7 due to variable RBC lysing methods used in preparing flow mononuclear cell \nsuspension. Megakaryocytic dysplasia cannot be assessed in FCM. \nMDS-FRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FLOW CYTOMETRY\n1 Bellos F, Kern W.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-2 Overview \nThe myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent myeloid clonal \nhemopathies with a relatively heterogeneous spectrum of presentation.  \nDiagnosis and disease stratification are based on multiple factors that \ninclude clinical data, morphology of peripheral blood and bone marrow, \nfluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), cytogenetics, flow cytometry, and \nnext-generation sequencing myeloid mutation studies.  The major clinical \nmorbidities associated with these disorders are cytopenia- associated \ncomplications and the po tential for MDS to evolve into acute myeloid \nleukemia (AML). In addition, chronic transfusions, treatment toxicity, and in \nsome cases, secondary phenomena such as systemic inflammatory \nconditions  can increase the complexity of care for patients with MDS .1 In \nthe general population, the incidence rate of MDS is approximately 4. 5 per \n100,000 people per year.2 MDS is rare among children/adolescents and \nyoung adults . Accounting for 1.6% of patients diagnosed with MDS, \nindividuals <40 years of age have an incidence of 0.1 per 100,000 people \nper year . However, among individuals between ages 70 and 79 years, the \nincidence rate increases to 26.9  per 100,000 people, and further to 55.4  \nper 100,000 people among those ≥80 years of age .2  \nThe management of MDS is complicated by the generally advanced age \nof the patients , median age 77 years,3 the non- hematologic comorbidities  \ncommonly seen in this cohort , and the relative inability of patients who are \nolder to tolerate certain intensive forms of therapy. In addition, when the \nillness progresses into AML, these patients experience lower response rates to standard therapy than patients with de novo AML.\n4 \nThe multidisciplinary P anel of experts for the NCCN Clinical Practice \nGuidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Myelo dysplastic \nSyndromes meets annually to update recommendations on standard \napproaches to the diagnosis and treatment of MDS in adults. These recommendations are based on a review of recent clinical evidence that has led to important advances in treatment or has yielded new information \non biologic factors that may have prognostic significance in MDS.  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria \nPrior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines® for Myelodysplastic \nSyndromes, an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain key literature in MDS published since the previous \nGuidelines update, using the search term: myelodysplastic syndrome. \nThe PubMed database was chosen becaus e it remains the most widely \nused resource for medical literature and indexes peer -reviewed \nbiomedical literature .5 \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial,  Phase II; Clinical Trial,  Phase III; Clinical Trial,  Phase IV; \nGuideline; Practice Guideline; Meta -Analysis; Randomized Controlled \nTrial; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  The data from key \nPubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as \nrelevant to these guidelines as discussed by the Panel during the \nGuidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion section.  Recommendations for which high -level evidence is lacking are \nbased on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.    \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.6 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight biased; and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-3 inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. \nNCCN Guidelines incorporate non -gendered language, instead focusing \non organ -specific recommendations. This language is both more \naccurate and more inclusive and can help fully addr ess the needs of \nindividuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male \nwhen citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or \nsources that do not use inclus ive terms. Most studies do not report how \nsex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex \nassigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to \npredomina ntly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages \nresearchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their future \nanalyses.  \nDiagnostic Classification  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes  \nThe initial evaluation of patients with suspected MDS requires careful \nassessment of the peripheral blood smear and blood counts, marrow \nmorphology, cytogenetics, duration of abnormal blood counts, other \npotential causes of cytopenias, and concomitant illnesses. To establish the \ndiagnosis of MDS, careful morphologic review and correlation with the \npatient’s clinical features are important, because a number of medications \nand viral infections (including human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV] \ninfection) can cause morphologic changes in marrow cells that are similar \nto MDS.4,7 The NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes include \nthe World Health Organization ( WHO ) 2016  and 2022 and the \nInternational Consensus Classification (ICC)  2022 classification system s \nfor diagnostic evaluations .8,9 To assist in providing consistency in the diagnostic guidelines for MDS, an \nInternational Consensus Working Group recommended that minimal \ndiagnostic criteria for this disease include two prerequisites: stable \ncytopenia (for at least 6 months unless accompanied by a specific \nkaryotype or bilineage dysplasia, in which case only 2 months of stable \ncytopenias are needed) , and the exclusion of other potential disorders as \na primary reason for dysplasia or cytopenia or both. In addition, the diagnosis of MDS requires at least one of three MDS -related (decisive) \ncriteria: 1) dysplasia (≥10% in one or more of the three major bone marrow \nlineages); 2) a blast cell count of 5%  to 19%; and 3) a specific \nMDS -associated karyotype [eg, del(5q), del(20q), +8, or -7/del(7q)] . \nFurthermore, several co- criteria may help confirm the diagnosis of MDS. \nThese co- criteria include aberrant immunophenotype by flow cytometry, \nabnormal bone marrow histology and immunohistochemistry, or the \npresence of molecular markers (ie, abnormal CD 34 antigen expression, \nfibrosis, dysplastic megakaryocytes, atypical localization of immature \nprogenitors, myeloid clonality).\n10  \nConsistent with these recommendations, as stated by WHO, the features \nthat are central for the diagnosis of MDS entail well -defined dysplasia in \none or more hematopoietic cell lines in addition to cytopenias. Cytopenias need to be persistent (for at least 4– 6 months) and lack other underlying \nconditions serving as a primary cause of the cytopenia.\n11 Further, \nanalyses of studies including the MDS databases, which generated the \nInternational Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and Revised IPSS \n(IPSS- R), have shown that the use of standard  hematologic values to \ndefine cytopenic cut points for MDS diagnosis  are more appropriate than \nthe WHO -recommended prognostic  cytopenia cut points.12  \nIn 2001, WHO proposed an alternative classification for MDS that was modified from the original French- American -British (FAB) definitions.\n13-15 \nThe 2022 WHO classification uses the abbreviation “MDS”  for PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-4 myelodysplastic neoplasms instead of myelodysplastic syndromes.8 As \nsuch, when  referring to the 2022 WHO classification  in this discussion, \n“MDS” refers to myelodysplastic neoplasms. However, the abbreviation \n“MDS/MPN” refers  to myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm. The \n2022 WHO guidelines identify multiple  entities of MDS  classified as \ngenetically defined MDS : MDS  with low blasts and isolated 5q deletion \n(MDS -5q; previously MDS -del(5q)) , MDS  with low blasts and SF3B1 \nmutation (MDS -SF3B1 ; previously MDS with ring sideroblasts [ MDS -RS]), \nMDS with biallelic TP53 inactivation ( MDS -biTP53) ; or classified as \nmorphologically defined MDS: MDS  with low blasts (MDS -LB; previously \nMDS with single lineage dysplasia [MDS -SLD] and MDS with multilineage \ndysplasia [MDS -MLD] ), MDS -hypoplastic, MDS  with increased blasts 1 \n(MDS -IB1; previously MDS with excess blasts 1 [ MDS -EB1]), MDS  with \nincreased blasts 2 (MDS -IB2; previously MDS -EB2) , and MDS with \nfibrosis  (see Pathologic -morphologic classifications of myelodysplastic \nneoplasms 2023  in the algorithm).8 The ICC system identifies the following \nMDS entities: MDS -del(5q), MDS -SF3B1 , myeloid neoplasms with TP53  \nmutation, MDS not otherwise specified ( MDS -NOS ), MDS with excess \nblasts ( MDS -EB), and MDS/AML.  The Panel cautions that classifications \nalone do not imply therapeutic choice.  \nThe del(5q) entity is defined by the presence of this deletion and can \ninclude one additional cytogenetic abnormality, with the exception of \nmonosomy 7 or del(7q), which is associated with poor outcomes.16 The \nmodification of this definition stemmed from data that showed a prognostic \nstratification among patients with del(5q) based on the number of \nadditional cytogenetic abnormalities compared to the single mutation \ndel(5q).17-19  \nThe division between MDS and AML is a continued area of debate. The original FAB definition of MDS included patients with up to 30% blasts. \nThe 2001 WHO classification reduced the upper limit for blast percentage for MDS to 19%, rather than the previous cutoff of 29%, thereby \nreclassifying these patients as “AML with myelodysplasia- related \nchanges.”\n20 It was noted in the 2008 WHO classification that some \npatients with AML with myelodysplasia- related changes who have 20% to \n29% marrow blasts may behave in a manner more similar to MDS than to AML. Data suggest that these patients have less aggressive dis ease and \nimproved outcomes and therapeutic responses compared to patients with >30% blasts and should be considered a favorable group of AML.\n21 The \nNCCN Panel recognizes that MDS are not only related to blast \nquantitation, but they also possess a differing pace of disease related to \ndistinctive biologic features when compared with de novo AML.22,23 \nTherefore, patients who have 20% to 29% marrow blasts may be \nconsidered to have MDS or AML.  A 20% blast cut off for AML evolving out \nof MDS and MDS -EB2 may be arbitrary in some clinical scenarios. \nAML-style therapies may be considered for appropriate patients with \nMDS -EB2, especially at younger ages of presentation. Furthermore, a \ndiagnosis of AML may be made with <20% in patients with certain \ncytogenetic abnormalities  per ICC  (See NCCN Guidelines for Acute \nMyeloid Leukemia ). Some clinical trials designed for high- grade MDS may \nallow the enrollment of patients with AML -MDS.24,25 Some patients with \nhigher -risk disease with WHO 2022 MDS -IB2 and ICC MDS/AML  could be \nconsidered for AML -type therapy.8,9 Patients who have previously been \nincluded in and benefitted from therapeutic trials for MDS should continue \nto be eligible for MDS -type therapy. The clinician should consider such \nfactors as age, antecedent factors, cytogenetics, comorbidities, pace of \ndisease, performance status, and the patient’s goal of treatment. This \nrecommendation is further supported by the results from several validation studies and analyses.\n26-30  \nThe WHO classifications were  revised to improve both the diagnostic and \nprognostic capabilities of these entities.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-5 therapy.31 With a moderate degree of variability, patients with MDS -EB or \nMDS -EB in transformation ( MDS -EB-T) generally have a relatively poor \nprognosis, with a median survival ranging from 5 to 12 months. In contrast, \npatients with MDS -RS-SLD (RA) or MDS -RS have a median survival of \napproximately 3 to 6 years. The proportion of these individuals with \ndisease that transforms to AML ranges from 5% to 15% in the low -risk \nMDS -RS-SLD/ MDS -RS group to 40% to 50% in the relatively high -risk \nMDS -EB/MDS- EB-T group. In a study evaluating time- to-disease \nevolution, 25% of MDS -EB cases and 55% of MDS -EB-T cases underwent \ntransformation to AML in the first year, increasing to 35% of MDS -EB \ncases and 65% of MDS -EB-T cases within 2 years.4 In contrast, the \nincidence of transformation for RA was 5% in the first year and 10% within \n2 years. None of the patients with MDS -RS developed leukemia within 2 \nyears.  \nBiologic evidence indicates that similar clinical phenotypes, including lower \nblast counts, older age, lower white blood cell (WBC) counts, and higher \nerythroblast counts in bone marrow, are seen in patients with splicing \nfactor (SF) mutations among the MD S-EB, MDS -EB-T, and some AML \ncategories compared with SF- non-mutated cases. This suggests that \nSF-mutated cases comprised a distinct entity among MDS/AML32,33 and \nthat SF- mutant MDS -EB/MDS- EB-T constitutes a related disorder \noverriding the artificial separation between AML and MDS. AML evolving \nfrom MDS (AML -MDS) is often more resistant to standard cytotoxic \nchemotherapy than is de novo AML, especially those AM L cases that do \nnot have TP53 mutations nor those typical of secondary MDS,33 which \narises without a known antecedent hematologic disorder. High- risk MDS, \nAML-MDS, and some older  patients with AML may have a more indolent \nclinical course in terms of short -term progression compared with patients \nwho have standard presentations of de novo AML. This emphasizes the \nneed to treat at least some patients with a standard presentation of de  novo AML33 differently than patients with indolent MDS (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Acute Myeloid Leukemia).  \nMyelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms \nThe category of MDS/MPN was added to the 2008 update of the WHO \nclassification of myeloid neoplasms.34 In the 2022 update, t his category \nincludes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) -1 and CMML -2, \nMDS/MPN and neutrophilia (previously aCML) , MDS/MPN with SF3B1  \nmutation and thrombocytosis  (previously MDS/MPN with ring sideroblasts \n[RS] and thrombocytosis) , and MDS/MPN NOS (previously MDS/MPN \nunclassifiable) .8 (See MDS/MPN , Classification  in the algorithm).  Juvenile \nmyelomonocytic leukemia (JMM L) is classified as  a myeloproliferative \nneoplasm.   \nIn the ICC, CMML has been subdivided into two groups based on \nmolecular and clinical differences: CMML -myelodysplastic  (WBC  count  \n≤13 x 109/L) and CMML -myeloproliferative (WBC count > 13 x 109/L).9 In \naddition to the WBC count, the percentage of blasts plus monocytes in the \nperipheral blood and bone marrow has demonstrated prognostic \nsignificance. Two blast -based groups are included in the WHO 2022  \nclassification: CMML -1 for patients with < 10% bone marrow blasts  or \nblasts equivalents ; and CMML -2 for patients with 10 to <20% bone \nmarrow blasts  or blasts equivalents.8 Mutations in the following genes are \nfrequently associated with CMML: TET2, SRSF2 , ASXL1 , RUNX1 , NRAS , \nand CBL.35,36  \nThe management of CMML depends on the characteristics of the patient’s \ndisease and is typically focused on supportive care and cytoreductive \ntherapy.37 In patients with CMML- 1 and CMML -2, decitabine and \nazacitidine (AzaC) have demonstrated efficacy ,37-41 and emerging data \nsuggest utility  of ruxolitinib in this context.42 Patients with higher -risk \nIPSS- R and those with lower -risk IPSS- R with poor -risk genetic features, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

Patients with a \nt(5;12) translocation associated with the ETV6 ::PDGFRβ  fusion gene may \nrespond to imatinib mesylate.37,46,47 Patients with CMML may also have \nsystemic mastocytosis  with an associated hematologic neoplasm  (SM-\nAHN) and KIT 816V mutation responsive to midostaurin.48,49 Molecular \ntesting with a high -sensitivity polymerase chain reaction is required to \ndetect KIT D816V . Hypomethylating agents ( HMAs ) or hydroxyurea may \nbe considered for patients with CMML -1. HMAs , with or without \nvenetoclax , and/or allogeneic HCT, is recommended for patients with \nCMML -2. In non- transplant candidates, the risk of cytopenias with the \naddition of venetoclax should be carefully considered. Ruxolitinib may be added to HMAs for symptom management or splenomegaly for CMML- 2.  \nMDS/MPN and neutrophilia (termed aCML in the ICC) , is rare and has \nsimilar neutrophilia as the chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) subtype of \nMPN. However, molecular characterization may distinguish the two \nentities. The presence of CSF3R mutations is strongly associated with \nCNL but is present in <10% of  cases.\n50,51 Other MPN -associated driver \nmutations (ie, JAK2, CALR, MPL ) are uncommon. The presence of \nSETBP1 or ETNK1 mutations (or both) is reported in up to one  third of \npatients .52-56 The use of HMAs  in MDS/MPN and neutrophilia is a rational \napplication of their established activity in MDS and CMML.57-59 Emerging \ndata suggest that rare patients with CSF3R  or JAK2 mutations may \nrespond to ruxolitinib therapy  due to their JAK -STAT pathway \nactivation.58,60,61 Although the data on HCT procedures are  limited, \nallogeneic HCT is the only treatment modality that can induce long- term remissions in aCML.54,57,58,62 HMA s and/or ruxolitinib and/or allogeneic \nHCT may be considered for patients with MDS/MPN and neutrophilia.57,61 \nMDS -RS-T includes patients who  present with clinical and morphologic \nfeatures consistent with MDS and thrombocytosis (platelet counts ≥450 x \n109/L).63 The morphology is characterized by MDS -RS features (no blasts \nin the peripheral blood, dysplastic erythroid proliferation, RS  ≥15% of \nerythroid precursors, and <5% blasts in marrow) with proliferation of large , \natypical megakaryocytes similar to those seen in essential \nthrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis. The frequency of spliceosome \ngene SF3B1 mutations in up to 60% of MDS -RS-T cases has resulted in \nthe inclusion of MDS/MPN -RS-T (termed MDS/MPN -T-SF3B1  or \nMDS/MPN -RS-T, NOS in the ICC) as a full entity.64-67 SF3B1 mutations \nare associated with the presence of RS  and frequently have the JAK2 \nV617F mutation or MPL  W515K/L mutation.63 In contrast to MDS -RS, \nSF3B1 mutations do not change the required percentage of RS for \ndiagnostic classification. CALR mutations have also been reported.68 Case \nreports suggest efficacy of lenalidomide at alleviating the need for red \nblood cell (RBC) transfusions in patients with MDS/MPN -RS-T.68-70 HMAs \nand/or lenalidomide69; or luspatercept -aamt71 may be considered. In one \nstudy, out of 14 patients with MDS/MPN -RS-T randomized to receive \nluspatercept, 64.3% achieved RBC -TI of ≥8 weeks during weeks 1 to 24, \ncompared to 22.2% out of 9 patients randomized to receive placebo ( P = \n.028).71 \nMDS/MPN -U (termed MDS/MPN NOS in the ICC) is a rare diagnosis, \nmaking up < 5% of all myeloid disorders.72 This disorder is a myeloid \nneoplasm with mixed MDS/MPN features at onset, but does not meet the \nWHO criteria for any other MDS/MPN, MDS, or MPN.73 The diagnostic \ncriteria include: clinical and morphologic features consistent with MDS and thrombocytosis (platelet counts ≥450 x 10\n9/L), and WBC count ≥13 x \n109/L.

In the 2022 WHO update, it is now classified as an MPN. In the \nICC, this is classified as a pediatric disorder and/or germline mutation- associated disorder. Clinical and hematologic criteria for the \ndiagnosis of JMML include: peripheral blood monocyte count ≥ 1 x 10\n9/L; \nblast percentage in the peripheral blood and bone marrow <20%; \nsplenomegaly; and the absence of BCR::ABL1 rearrangement.73 Although \nno mutations are exclusive to this disease subtype, the most frequently \nmutated genes in JMML are PTPN11  (40% –50%), NRAS  (15% –20%), \nKRAS (10% –15%), CBL (15% –18%), and NF1 (10% –15%).76,77 \nSecondary mutations in the SETBP1 and JAK3  genes were also \nreported.77 In some patients, these mutations may be present as germline \nvariants where they are frequently associated with Noonan syndrome or \nother congenital syndromes (see Genes Frequently Somatically Mutated \nin MDS in the algorithm ). In patients who do not have genetic features of \nJMML, with at least two of the following must be present : hemoglobin F \nincreased for age; myeloid or erythroid precursors on peripheral blood \nsmear; granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating factor (GM -CSF) hypersensitivity in colony ass ay; and hyperphosphorylation of STAT5 .8,73 \nAllogeneic HCT is the main treatment option for JMML.54,78 \nIn patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) skin \nlesions, approximately  10% to 20% of cases are associated or develop \ninto other myeloid neoplasms, including CMML, MDS, or AML.79 \nTherefore, an accurate pathologic diagnosis is important for patients to receive the best care. Tagraxofusp has been shown to be a potentially \nuseful therapy for these patients.\n80    \nHydroxyurea may be helpful in decreasing excessive leukocytosis or \nthrombocytosis  for the subtypes described above (except for BPDCN) .81 \nFor patients with MDS or MDS/MPN overlap syndromes, observation may \nbe considered to document indolent course versus marked progression of severe cytopenia or increase in blasts.  \nIndolent Myeloid Hematopoietic Disorders  \nThe spectrum of indolent myeloid hematopoietic disorders encompasses four groups: clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP); \nidiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS) ; lower -risk clonal \ncytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS) ; and higher -risk CCUS . \nBased on cytopenia(s), dysplasia, clonality, and risk of transformation , \npatients can be classified within the spectrum (see Spectrum of Indolent Myeloid Hematopoietic Disorders  in the algorithm). These disorders can \nevolve into MDS or AML, al though the frequency of progression may differ \namong the four groups.  \nCHIP and CCUS are defined by the presence of a clonal karyotypic \nabnormality (present in ≥2 metaphases) and/or a somatic mutation in a \ngene involved in hematopoiesis (present at >2% variant allele frequency). There is an absence of marrow dysplasia in these patients. CCUS differs \nfrom CHIP by having the presence of cytopenia.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-8 other pre -malignant conditions, there is a higher risk of subsequent \nhematologic disease compared to patients who do not have somatic \nmutations.82,83 Additionally, shorter survival in these patients compared \nwith aged- matched controls has been demonstrated and may be attributed \nto non -hematologic causes.83 The most frequently mutated genes \nassociated with CHIP include DNMT3A , TET2, ASXL1 , RUNX1 , JAK2 , \nPPM1D , TP53, and SF  genes.83-85 Patients with pathogenic mutations with \n>10% variant allelic frequency and ≥2 somatic mutations, spliceosome \ngene mutations, or mutations of RUNX1  or JAK2  have positive predictive \nvalues for myeloid neoplasms (ie, MDS, MPN, AML).86 Isolated mutations \nof DNMT3A , TET2 , and ASXL1 have less predictive value.86 The risk for \nmyeloid neoplasm is increased 3- , 37-, and 348 -fold in low -risk, \nintermediate- risk, and high- risk CHIP/CCUS, respectively, compared to \nunmutated controls.87 ICUS has no known cause, lack somatic mutations \nor clonal karyotypic abnormalities. There is significant heterogeneity within \nICUS, with some patients experiencing spontaneous resolution of disease \nand others developing a myeloid neoplasm.88 Data are limited regarding \nnatural history and disease progression for these two disorders.   \nAn online calculator should be considered to obtain a clonal \nhematopoiesis risk score (CHRS) with a corresponding risk category (low, \nintermediate, or high), as these risk groups significantly differ in the 10 -\nyear probabilities of developing myeloid neoplasm s, as well as OS.87 The \nCHRS may have a role in clinical decision- making but requires \nconfirmatory evidence to help assess its efficacy. A recent study has \nintroduced an alternative risk model designed to aid in the prediction of \nclonal hematopoiesis to myeloid neoplasm.89 This model  calculates the \nyear-to-year probabilities for  the development of  each type of myeloid \nneoplasm over a 15 -year period.   \nTwo studies have focused on the role of mutational analysis in indolent malignant disease. In a prospective analysis of 144 patients, Kwok and colleagues\n90 used a 22- gene panel to determine the frequency of MDS -\nassociated mutations. Among these patients, 17% were categorized as \nMDS, 15% as ICUS with mild dysplasia, and 69% as ICUS without \ndysplasia. Further analysis showed that 35% of patients with ICUS had a \nsomatic mutation or chromosomal abnormality similar to MDS; these \npatients were characterized as CCUS. The similar mutational features \nmay have a role in the diagnostic value of these disorders.90 \nCargo et al88 evaluated mutational features associated with ICUS in \npatients with disease that developed into progressive dysplasia or AML. \nAlthough this study was not designed to evaluate the diagnostic role of \nmutations, detection of mutational features predicted progression to high-\nrisk disease and OS. The study proposes that patients who are defined as \npoor-risk may benefit from early intervention.  \nNCCN recommends that following the initial evaluation, regular monitoring \nof blood counts in patients with these indolent myeloid hematopoietic \ndisorders occur at least every 3 to 6 months. More frequent monitoring \nmay be recommended based on clinical expertise.  Observation is the \nrecommended clinical approach. Monitoring is recommended for CHIP (based on clinical change), ICUS (yearly), lower -risk CCUS (yearly), and \nhigh- risk CCUS ( CBC 2 to 4 times  yearly ).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-9 Shwachman- Diamond syndrome,104 dyskeratosis congenita (DC),105 \nneurofibromatosis type 1,106 Bloom syndrome,107,108 Noonan syndrome,109 \nand Dubowitz syndrome.110 Prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy (eg, \nalkylating agents, epipodophyllotoxins, topoisomerase II inhibitors)111- 114 or \nradiation115,116 increases the risk for MDS.  \nThe 2022 WHO classification identifies 2  childhood myelodysplastic \nneoplasms : Childhood MDS with low blasts (previously termed refractory \ncytopenia of childhood [RCC] ) and childhood MDS with increased blasts .8 \nRCC is the most common subtype of MDS found in children, accounting \nfor approximately 50% of cases.93 Abnormal karyotypes are found in 30% \nto 50% of children with MDS,117 most common are numerical anomalies \nwith <10% showing structural abnormalities. Monosomy 7 is the most \ncommon cytogenetic abnormality, occurring in 30% of cases,118,119 \nfollowed by trisomy 8120,121 and trisomy 21.122 The del(5q) abnormality is \nrarely seen in children.123 Clinically, isolated RAs  are uncommon in \nchildren. Thrombocytopenia and/or neutropenia, often accompanied by \nhypocellular marrow, is a common presentation. Fetal hemoglobin levels \nare frequently elevated.  \nDifferential diagnoses include aplastic anemia (AA) and AML. Compared to AA, children with MDS have a significantly elevated mean corpuscular \nvolume; clonal hematopoiesis is confirmatory. Higher expression of p53, \nlower expression of survivin, or the presence of MDS -related cytogenetic \nabnormalities can also help differentiate MDS from AA.\n124 Compared with \nAML, low WBC count, multi -lineage dysplasia, and clonal hematopoiesis \nwith numerical, rather than structural, cytogenetic abnormalities suggest \nMDS. A bone marrow blast count of < 20% also suggests MDS, but \nbiologic  features are more important than a strict blast cutoff value. \nMonosomy 7 strongly suggests MDS. When patients present with AML, \nthe marrow frequently shows dysplastic features, but this does not \nnecessarily indicate that the AML arose after MDS. Indeed, c riteria for the diagnosis of MDS in a patient who presents with AML are stringent.125 \nDysplasia in bone marrow cells may also be due to other etiologies including infection (eg, Parvo virus,\n126,127 herpes viruses,128 HIV), \ndeficiencies of B 12 and copper,129 drug therapy, and chronic disease.130 \nCongenital dyserythropoietic anemia, congenital sideroblastic anemia, and \nPearson syndrome should also be excluded.  \nChildren with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing leukemia (50 -fold greater risk if younger than 5 years), and are usually \ncategorized as having acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL, \nM7).\n95,97,131,132 This commonly has a prodromal phase of cytopenia(s) \nsimilar to MDS and may be considered a spectrum of the same disease. \nPrognosis of patients with Down syndrome and AMKL is quite good  with \nan 80% cure rate when treated with intensive chemotherapy. HCT is not \nindicated in first complete remission for these children. Newborns with \nDown syndrome can develop abnormal myelopoiesis with leukocytosis, \ncirculating blasts, anemia, and thrombocy topenia, but this resolves \nspontaneously within weeks to months. Approx imately 20% of children \nwith Down syndrome, who have transient abnormal myelopoiesis, will \nsubsequently develop AMKL.96 \nThere is a paucity of clinical trials due to the rarity and heterogeneity of \nMDS in children. The primary goal of treatment is generally a cure rather \nthan palliation. HCT is the only curative option in childhood MDS with \n3-year disease- free survival rates of approximately 50%.133- 135 \nMyeloablative therapy with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan, \nfollowed by either matched family or matched unrelated donor allogeneic \nHCT is the treatment of choice for children with MDS. Other treatments \nsuch as chemotherapy, growth factors, and immunosuppressive therapy \n(IST) have a limited role. Prognosis for untreated MDS depends on the \nrate of progression to AML. The stage of the disease at the time of HCT \nstrongly predicts outcome.119 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-10 Patients with RCC have a median time to progression to advanced MDS \nof 1.7 years,119 but the time to progression is highly variable, depending on \nthe underlying cause of MDS and standard prognostic factors.136 Patients \nwith JMML have a variable prognosis; some younger patients with \nfavorable genetics and clinical features have resolution of JMML without \ntreatment, while others progress rapidly despite allogeneic HCT.137 \nChildren diagnosed before age 2 years have the best prognosis. Poor \nprognostic features include high hemoglobin F, older age, and \nthrombocytopenia.  \nPediatric AML or MDS with monosomy 7 has a poor prognosis with \nconventional therapies. A review of 16 patients with AML and MDS with \nmonosomy 7 treated by two transplant programs from 1992 to 2003 \n(MDS, n  = 5; therapy -related MDS [t -MDS], n  = 3; AML, n = 5; \ntherapy -related AML [t -AML], n  = 3) reported a 2 -year event -free survival \nof 69%.138 Four of the five deaths occurred in patients transplanted with \nactive leukemia. Seven of eight patients with MDS were alive without \nevidence of disease ( six in first complete remission, one in second \ncomplete remission, and one death due to complications).138 \nAlthough MDS can occur in both adult and pediatric populations, the treatment strategies and recommendations are not necessarily the same. \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes focus on \nrecommendations for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of adult \npatients with MDS; therefore, the discussions that follow pertain to adult \npatients.  \nEvaluation  \nSeveral types of evaluations are needed to determine the clinical status of \npatients with MDS. Understanding clinical status is necessary for \ndiagnostic and prognostic categorization and to determine treatment \noptions.  Initial Evaluation  \nClinical history should include the timing, severity, and tempo of abnormal \ncytopenias; prior infections or bleeding episodes; and number of \ntransfusions. Cytopenias are defined as values lower than standard \nlaboratory hematologic levels, being aware of ag e, sex, ethnic, and \naltitude norms.12 Concomitant medications and comorbid conditions \nrequire careful assessment. Because MDS are relatively indolent \ndisorders, blood count stability is used to distinguish MDS from evolving \nAML. Other possible causes of cytopenias require careful evaluation.  \nIn addition to establishing current blood and reticulocyte counts, clinicians \nneed a peripheral blood smear evaluation to determine the degree of \ndysplasia and, thus,  potentially dysfunctional cells. Bone marrow \naspiration with Prussian blue stain for iron and a biopsy are needed to evaluate the degree and relative proportions of hematopoietic cell \nmaturation abnormalities, percentage of marrow blasts, marrow cellulari ty, \npresence or absence of RS (and presence of iron per se), and fibrosis. \nCytogenetics fo r bone marrow samples (by standard karyotyping methods) \nshould be obtained, because they are of major prognostic importance. If standard cytogenetics with 20 or more  metaphases cannot be obtained, \nchromosome microarray analysis ( CMA )/ chromosome genomic array \ntesting (CGA T)\n61 or MDS -related FISH panel should be performed.  If \nkaryotype is normal, the CMA  should be considered. However, CMAs \ndetect both somatic and germline or constitutional changes  (see table of \nCommon Cytogenetic Abnormalities in MDS  in the algorithm ). \nBone marrow biopsy staining for reticulin is recommended for evaluating \nthe presence and degree of bone marrow fibrosis.139 Increased reticulin \nfibers in the marrow at diagnosis are seen in approximately 5% to 10% of MDS cases.\n140- 143 MDS with fibrosis is  considered a distinct subtype of \nMDS in the 2022  WHO classification.8 These patients frequently present PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-11 with severe pancytopenia and decreased survival in these patients has \nbeen reported.140,141 \nBone marrow or peripheral blood cells should be assayed for somatic \nmutations in genes associated with MDS (see Genes Frequently \nSomatically Mutated in MDS  in the algorithm) as these gene mutations \nmay be clinically useful in specific contexts. For example, mutations in \nsplice factor genes are much more common in patients with MDS, MDS -\nSF3B1 , and CMML compared to other myeloid neoplasms. Approximately \n40% of patients with MDS will carry a mutation in one of the three most \nfrequently mutated splice factors: SF3B1 , SRSF2 , and U2AF1.144 A typical \nmutation in one of these genes indicates the presence of clonally derived \nhematopoiesis and may help determine diagnosis in the appropriate \nclinical context.   \nMutations of SF3B1  are associated with the presence of RS  and are highly \nprevalent in patients with MDS -RS or MDS -RS-T (>80%).65 Mutations of \nJAK2  are found in 50% of patients with MDS -RS-T, although it is much \nrarer in other subtypes. Mutations of SRSF2  are enriched in patients with \nCMML, although it is not unique to this subtype. Patients with JMML will \noften have mutations in one of the tyrosine kinase signaling genes such as \nPTPN11 , NF1, NRAS , KRAS , or CBL .77 In many cases, these mutations \nare congenital and part of a larger syndrome.  \nTypical mutations in other genes (see Genes Frequently Somatically \nMutated in MDS in the algorithm) can also establish the presence of clonal \nhematopoiesis, but they are less specific for disease subtype. Of note, \nseveral mutated genes associated with MDS (eg, TET2, DNMT3A , SF3B1 , \nEZH2 , NRAS , BRAF , TP53) can be mutated in other neoplasms, including \nlymphoid malignancies. Rare patients  can have dual diagnoses (eg, MDS \nand chronic lymphocytic leukemia), which can confound the interpretation of sequencing results. Therefore, the presence of mutations must be \ninterpreted in an appropriate clinical context consistent with MDS. Acquired mutations of TET2  and DNMT3A  are frequent in MDS but have \nalso been identified in people who are older  with clonal hematopoiesis and \nnormal blood counts. Whether mutations of these or other genes are \npredictive of MDS in patients with cytopenias who do not meet \nmorphologic diagnostic criteria for MDS is not known. Therefore, somatic \nmutations should not be used as presumptive evidence of MDS in the \nabsence of other diagnostic features. Patients with cytopenias who lack \nbone marrow findings diagnostic of MDS can have somatic mutations \nindicative of clonal hematopoiesis, and as indicated above, those with \npathogenic mutations with >10% variant allelic frequency and ≥2 somatic \nmutations, spliceosome gene mutations, or mutations of RUNX1  or JAK2  \nhave positive predictive values for myeloid neoplasms (ie, MDS, MPN, \nAML).\n86 The mere presence of a mutation is not a substitute for the \npathologic diagnosis of MDS (ie, requiring dysplasia) and should not be used as the sole indication for treatment. Mutations in some non -MDS \ngenes may indicate the presence of neoplasms that can mimic MDS. These include CALR mutations associated with primary myelofibrosis, \nCSF3R  mutations associated with aCML and CNL, and STAT3  mutations \nassociated with large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia.  If MDS is read \nout by the evaluating pathologist, reflex testing including cytogenetics and molecular testing should be performed as a standard p ractice. A unified \nreport that includes molecular -genetic results with pathological description \nis required for appropriate diagnosis and therapy selection. For discussion \nregarding the prognostic value of molecular abnormalities, see Molecular \nAbnormalities in MDS.  \nOther useful recommended laboratory screening tests include serum \nerythropoietin (sE PO), vitamin B\n12, serum or RBC folate levels, serum \nferritin, iron, and total iron- binding capacity (TIBC). Serum ferritin levels \nmay be nonspecific, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. In such cases, obtaining the serum iron levels and \nTIBC along w ith serum ferritin may be helpful.

LDH is a measure of the systemic inflammation that \noccurs as a result of tissue turnover or hemolysis. The IPSS and IPSS -R \nidentified LDH as a prognostic feature and other studies have supported the association. In a retrospective study, LDH levels taken at diagnosis \nwere stratified in patients with disease categorized as IPSS -R \nintermediate. Patients with LDH levels ≥320 U/L (n  = 8) had a significantly \nshorter overall OS  than patients with levels below 320 U/L (n = 28; 347 \ndays vs. 1339 days, respectively; P  = .03).\n146 \nThere have been reports that copper deficiency can mimic many of the \nperipheral blood and marrow findings seen in MDS.147- 149 Copper \ndeficiency is an etiology of anemia, neutropenia, and bone marrow \ndysplasia that may be under -recognized. There are rare cases of  patients \nwith clinical presentation consistent with MDS who  may be deficient in \ncopper and for whom copper supplementation may resolve hematologic \nabnormalities. Copper and ceruloplasmin level assessments should be \nconsidered as part of the initial diagnostic workup in patients suspected of \nhaving low -risk MDS, esp ecially those with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders \nand neuropathy.150 Clinical features associated with copper deficiency \ninclude vacuolation of myeloid and/or erythroid precursors,147- 149 prior GI \nsurgery,147,148 a history of vitamin B 12 deficiency,148,151 severe malnutrition, \nand a history of zinc supplementation.  \nAdditional molecular and genetic screening for heritable hematologic \nmalignancy predisposition is recommended in a subset of patients , \nparticularly in patients < 50 years  of age . Diseases , syndromes , and \nmutations  that may potentially be associated  include GATA2 deficiency \nsyndrome, Shwachman -Diamond syndrome, short telomere syndromes , DDX41  mutations (usually present at older ages), and others  (see Genetic  \nFamilial High -Risk Assessment:  Hereditary Myeloid Malignancy \nPredisposition Syndromes  and see  Gene Mutations Associated with \nHereditary Myeloid Malignancies in the algorithm). Shortened telomere \nlength has been associated with diseases of bone marrow failure, \nincluding inherited disorders such as dyskeratosis congenita, particularly \nin the presence of mutations in the DKC1 , TERT,  or TERC genes that \nencode for components of the  telomere complex.152,153 Telomere length \ncan be measured by FISH assays using leukocyte (or leukocyte subset) \nsamples.152,154 Other genetic lesions, such as those occurring in the \nRUNX1  or GATA2  gene, have been implicated in familial cases of MDS \nand other myeloid malignancies.  \nLesions within the RUNX1  gene (mutations, deletions, or translocations) \nhave been identified as one cause of a relatively rare autosomal -dominant \nfamilial platelet disorder that predisposes these patients to myeloid \nmalignancies.155,156 In affected families with the RUNX1  lesions, the \nincidence of MDS/AML is high, ranging from 20% to 60% in which the \nmedian age of onset is 33 years.157 This familial platelet disorder is \ncharacterized by the presence of thrombocytopenia, and a tendency for mild-to-moderate bleeding generally presents from childhood; however, \nsome affected individuals may not display these clinical characteristics.\n157 \nDifferent types of genetic lesions in RUNX1  account for the variable \nphenotypes associated with familial platelet disorder between different families. Cryptic genetic lesions in RUNX1  have been reported in some \npatients with Fanconi anemia and MDS/AML.\n158 Identification of Fanconi \nanemia is clinically important, because it is associated with chromosomal \nfragility that results in variability of disease response to HMAs .  \nThe GATA2  gene codes for a transcription factor involved in gene \nregulation during the development and differentiation of hematopoietic \ncells and its expression was shown to correlate with severe dysplasia in PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

Flow cytometry for assessing the \npercentage of blast cells in the bone marrow (as measured by the cell \nsurface expression of CD34) may also be valuable in some clinical \nsituations, including detection of LGL disease. It should be emphasized, \nhowever, that estimates of blast percentage by flow cytometry do not \nprovide the same prognostic information as the blast per centage derived \nfrom morphologic evaluation. Accordingly, flow cyto metry data should not \nbe used in lieu of the determination of morphologic blast percentage by \nan experienced hematopathologist.  Flow cytometry may be considered as \na diagnostic aid for MDS and may be considered along with T CR \npolymerase chain reaction and STAT3  mutation testing to evaluate for \nLGL and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clone.  \nThe screening for PNH or STAT3 -mutant cytotoxic T -cell clones is \npotentially useful for determining which patients may be more responsive \nto IST, particularly young patients with normal cytogenetics and \nhypoplastic MDS161- 163 (see Prognostic Stratification ). PNH is a rare , \nacquired disorder of the blood arising from mutations in the PIGA  gene \nresulting in defective synthesis of the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) \nanchor. This, in turn, leads to a deficiency of proteins that are normally \nlinked to the cell membrane of blood cells via a GPI anchor.164- 167 \nDeficiency in GPI -anchored proteins such as those involved in complement inhibition (eg, CD55, CD59) leads to complement sensitivity \nof RBCs and subsequent hemolysis.164,165 Flow cytometry is the \nestablished method for detecting GPI -anchor –deficient cells for the \ndiagnosis of PNH. Fluorescent aerolysin (FLAER), a protein that \nspecifically binds to GPI anchors, has been shown to be a highly specific \nand reliable marker for det ecting GPI -anchor –deficient clones among \ngranulocytes or monocytes.168 For evaluation of PNH clonogenicity, \nmultiparameter flow cytometry analysis of granulocytes and monocytes \nusing FLAER, and at least one GPI -anchored protein, should be \nconsidered .164,165,168 It should be emphasized that although evidence of a \nminor PNH clone may be present in approximately  20% of patients with \nMDS, there is usually no evidence of PNH -related hemolysis in these \npatients.  \nCases of patients with myelodysplastic features and clonal expansion of \nLGLs have been reported.169- 172 In one of these studies, three out of nine \npatients responded to IST as indicated by improved blood counts.169 \nAlthough patients with both MDS and LGL did not respond as well as \npatients with LGL (33% vs. 66%; P = .01), the presence of the T- cell \nclone may reflect a target for IST. A second study reported improved \noutcomes in 61 patients with MDS with LGL clonogenicity receiving \nanti-thymocyte globulin (ATG).170 Moreover, the MDS -SLD refractory \nanemia ( RA) subtype was determined as a favorable predictor of \nresponse compared to patients with non-MDS -SLD RA (odds ratio [OR], \n0.15; 95% CI, 0.04– 0.59; P = .005).170 \nIn addition to basic flow cytometric evaluation at presentation for \ncharacterization of blasts and evaluation of lymphoid populations, \nexpanded flow cytometry may be a useful adjunct for diagnosis of MDS in \ndifficult cases.

For follow -up \nstudies, antibody combinations may be tailored to detect specific \nabnormalities implicated in the initial evaluation.  While aberrancies have \nalso been described in erythroid cells, most flow cytometry laboratories do not provide erythroid analysis.   \nThe European LeukemiaNET developed a flow cytometric score based on the reproducible parameters of CD34 and CD45 markers to aid in the \ndiagnosis of MDS.\n178 The scoring system was developed using multicenter \nretrospective data from patients with low -grade MDS (defined as <5% \nmarrow blasts; n = 417) and patients with non- clonal cytopenias as \ncontrols (n  = 380). This patient population was selected because low -\ngrade MDS often lack specific diagnostic markers (eg, RS , clonal \ncytogenetic abnormalities), which makes it difficult to diagnose based on \nmorphology alone. Bone marrow samples from patients with MDS \ncompared with samples from patients with non- clonal cyto penias showed \ndifferent flow cytometric patterns, including: 1) increased CD34+ myeloblast -related cluster size (defined by a wider distribution of CD45 \nexpression and greater side scatter [SSC] characteristics); 2) decreased CD34+ B -progenitor cluster siz e (defined by a relatively low CD45 \nexpression and low SSC); 3) aberrant myeloblast CD45 expression (based on the lymphocyte to myeloblast CD45 ratio); and 4) a decreased \ngranulocyte SSC value (based on the granulocyte to lymphocyte SSC \nratio).\n178 These four parameters were included in a logistic regression \nmodel, and a weighted score (derived from regression coefficients) was assigned to each parameter. The sum of the scores provided the overall \nflow cytometric score for each sample, with a score of 2 or higher defined as the threshold for MDS diagnosis.\n178 Using this flow cytometric score in \nthe learning cohort, a correct diagnosis of MDS was made with 70% \nsensitivity and 93% specificity. Among patients  with MDS without specific \nmarkers of dysplasia, 65% were correctly identified. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were 92% and 74%, respectively. These \noutcomes were confirmed in the validation cohort, which showed 69% \nsensitivity and 92% specificity.\n178 This flow cytometric scoring system \ndemonstrated a high diagnostic power in differentiating low -grade MDS \nfrom non -clonal cytopenias, and may be particularly useful in establishing \na diagnosis in situations where traditional diagnostic methods are indeter minate. Further independent validation studies are warranted to \ndetermine the utility of this method.  \nBecause of the associated expense, the requirement for both technical \nand interpretational expertise, and the need for greater consensus on \nspecific antibody combinations and procedures that are most informative \nand cost -effective, flow cytometric assays s hould be performed by \nexperienced laboratories and used in general practice only when \ndiagnosis is uncertain with traditional approaches (eg, blood counts, \nmorphology, cytogenetics, increased blasts). Flow cytometry studies may \nalso be used to assess the possibility of LGL disease, as indicated by \nLGLs present in the peripheral blood.\n179 In addition, STAT3  mutations are \ncommonly found in T -LGL disease.180 \nDetermination of platelet -derived growth factor receptor beta ( PDGFRβ) \ngene rearrangements at 5q32  may be helpful to evaluat e in patients with \nCMML.181 CMML with eosinophilia as well as other myeloid and lymphoid \nmalignancies with rearrangement of PDGFR β (locus 5q32) have \nconstitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor. Such diseases are \nconsidered unique entities by WHO and identification of these \nrearrangements is critical because of their exquisite sensitivity to imatinib.\n46,182- 184 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-15 Evaluation of Related Anemia  \nMajor morbidities of MDS include symptomatic anemia and associated \nfatigue. Progress has been made in the management of MDS -related \nanemia; however, the health care provider must also identify and treat any \ncoexisting causes of anemia. Standard assessments shoul d be performed \nto look for other causes of anemia, such as GI bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B\n12 \nstudies should be obtained and the cause of depletion corrected, if \npossible. After excluding or providing proper treatment for these causes of \nanemia, further consideration for treating MDS -related anemia should be \nundertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproductive macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal \nelevat ion of sE PO levels.\n4,185 Bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, \nbiopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS .  \nPrognostic Stratification  \nAlthough the diagnostic criteria allow for categorization of patients with \nMDS, the highly variable clinical outcomes within these subgroups indicate \nprognostic limitations. The morphologic features contributing to this \nvariability include the wide range of marrow blast percentages for patients \nwith MDS  and CMML (1% –19%); marrow cytogenetics; and the degree \nand number of morbidity -associated cytopenias. These well -perceived \nproblems for categorizing patients with MDS have led to the development \nof additional risk -based stratification systems.186,187 \nPrognostic Scoring Systems  \nIPSS  \nThe IPSS for primary MDS emerged from deliberations of the International MDS Risk Analysis Workshop (IMRAW).\n16 Compared with previous \nclassification systems, the risk- based IPSS markedly improved prognostic stratification of MDS cases. The IPSS was developed based on the \ncombined cytogenetic, morphologic, and clinical data from a relatively \nlarge group of MDS cases included in previously reported prognostic \nstudies.16,186  FAB morphologic criteria were used to establish the diagnosis \nof MDS. In addition, relative stability of peripheral blood counts for 4 to 6 weeks was needed to exclude other possible etiologies for the cytopenias, \nsuch as drugs, other diseases, or incipient evolution to AML. CMML was \nsubdivided into proliferative and non -proliferative subtypes. Patients with \nproliferative -type CMML (those with WBC counts ˃12,000/mcL) were \nexcluded from this analysis.\n16 Patients with non- proliferative CMML (with \nWBC counts of ≤12,000/mcL plus other features of MDS) were included.188 \nSignificant independent variables for determining survival and AML \nevolution outcomes were marrow blast percentage, number of cytopenias, \nand cytogenetic subgroup (good, intermediate, and poor). Patients with \nthe chromosome anomalies t(8;21) or inv(16) wer e considered to have \nAML and not MDS, regardless of the blast count. Age was also a critical variable for survival, although not for AML evolution. The percentage of \nmarrow blasts was divded into four categories: 1) <5%; 2) 5% to 10%; 3) \n11% to 20%; and 4)  21% to 30%.  \nCytopenias were defined for the IPSS as a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, an \nabsolute neutrophil count below 1800 cells/mcL, and a platelet count below 100,000 cells/mcL. Patients with normal marrow karyotypes, del(5q) \nalone, del(20q) alone, and - Y alone had relatively good prognoses (70%), \nwhereas patients with complex  abnormalities (three or more chromosome \nanomalies) or chromosome 7 anomalies had relatively poor prognoses \n(16%). The remaining patients were classified as having intermediate \noutcome (14%). Of t he patients in the “complex” category, the vast \nmajority had chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities in addition to other \nanomalies.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-16 To develop the IPSS for MDS, relative risk scores for each significant \nvariable (marrow blast percentage, cytogenetic subgroup, and number of \ncytopenias) were generated.16 By combining the risk scores for the three \nmajor variables, patients were stratified into four distinctive risk groups in terms of both survival and AML evolution: low, intermediate (int) -1, int -2, \nand high. When either cytopenias or cytogenetic subtypes w ere omitted \nfrom the classification, discrimination among the four subgroups was much \nless precise. Both for survival and AML evolution, the IPSS showed \nstatistically greater prognostic discriminating power than earlier \nclassification methods.\n16 \nIPSS- R \nThe IPSS -R defines five risk groups (very low, low, intermediate, high, and \nvery high) versus the four groups in the initial IPSS.189 The IPSS -R, which \nwas derived from an analysis of a large dataset from multiple international \ninstitutions, refined the original IPSS by incorporating the following into the \nprognostic model: more detailed cytogenetic subgroups, separate \nsubgroups within the “marrow blasts <5%” group, and a depth of \ncytopenias measurement defined with cutoffs for hemoglobin levels, \nplatelet counts, and neutrophil counts. In the IPSS -R, the cytogenetic \nsubgroups comprise five risk groups (vs. three in the original IPSS) bas ed \non a cytogenetic scoring system for MDS published in 2012.17 Other \nparameters including age, performance status, serum ferritin, LDH, and beta- 2 microglobulin provided additional prognostic information for survival \noutcomes, but not for AML evolution; age was more prognostic among \nlower -risk groups compared with the higher -risk groups.\n189 The predictive \nvalue of the IPSS -R was validated in a number of independent studies \nbased on registry data, including studies that evaluated outcomes for \npatients treated with HMAs .190- 195 \nIn a multiregional study of MDS patient registry data from Italy (N  = 646), \nsignificant differences in outcomes among the IPSS -R risk categories were found for OS, AML evolution, and progression- free survival (PFS) \n(later defined as leukemic evolution or death from any cause).196 Notably, \nthe predictive power (based on Harrell’s C statistics) of the IPSS -R was \nfound to be greater than the IPSS, WPSS, and refined WPSS for the three \noutcome measures mentioned above. The investigators acknowledged the \nlimitation of a short follow -up (median, 17 months) in the study cohort.196 \nIn a retrospective analysis of data from lower -risk MDS (IPSS low or int -1) \npatients in a large multicenter registry (N  = 2373 ) in Spain, the IPSS -R \ncould identify three risk categories (very low, low, intermediate) within the \nIPSS low -risk group with none of the patients categorized as IPSS -R high \nor very high.194 Within the IPSS int -1–risk group, the IPSS -R further \nstratified patients into four risk categories (very low, low, intermediate, \nhigh) with only one patient categorized as very high risk. Within the IPSS \nlow-risk group, median survival based on the IPSS -R risk categories was \n118.8 months for very low, 65.9 months for low, and 58.9 months for intermediate. Within the IPSS int -1 risk group, median surviv al based on \nthe IPSS- R risk categories was 113.7 months for very low, 61 .3 months for \nlow, 30. 4 months for intermediate, and 21.2 months for high risk. This \nstudy also applied the refined WP SS to further stratify the IPSS low and \nint-1 risk groups, and identified  a group of patients (refined WPSS high-\nrisk group) within the IPSS int -1 group who had poorer prognosis. \nHowever, the IPSS -R identified a larger proportion of patients with poor -\nrisk IPSS int -1 MDS than the refined WPSS (47% vs. 17%).  \nIn a retrospective database analysis of patients with MDS from a single \ninstitution (N  = 1088), median OS according to IPSS -R risk categories was \n90 months for very -low-, 54 months for low -, 34 months for intermediate -, \n21 months for high- , and 13 months for very -high- risk groups ( P < .005).\n193 \nThe median follow -up in this study was 70 months.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-17 significant survival benefit with AzaC was shown only for the groups of \npatients with very -high- risk (median survival, 18 vs. 25 months, \nrespectively; P < .028) and high- risk IPSS- R (median survival, 15 vs. 9 \nmonths, respectively; P = .005). In addition, significantly longer OS with \nallogeneic HCT was only observed for patients at high (median survival, 40 vs. 19 months without HCT; P  < .005) and very high (median survival, \n31 vs. 12 months without HCT; P  < .005) risk.\n193 The IPSS -R may \ntherefore provide a tool for therapeutic decision- making.  \nOne study applied the IPSS -R to a series of patients with t-MDS and \noligoblastic t -AML (ot -AML).197 Although some IPSS -R cutpoints were \nsuboptimal for patients  with t-MDS/ot -AML, the overall IPSS -R scores \nseparated patients with t-MDS/ot -AML into five risk groups, with each \ncategory showing statistical differences in OS as well as AML progression \nprobability in t -MDS. These findings indicated that the major IPSS -R \nvariables (bone marrow blast count, cytopenias, and cytogenetic dat a) \nremained powerful predictors in the therapy -related setting. However, \ncompared to de novo MDS/oligoblastic AML, the median OS for each \nIPSS- R risk group of patients was shorter in t -MDS/ot -AML, particularly in \nthe very -low- and low -risk groups. These di fferences likely reflect a \nnumber of factors, including different biology and clinical approaches (eg, \ntreatment, primary disease, and its therapies) between t -MDS/ot -AML and \nde novo disease. Data from the MDS Clinical Research Consortium \nsimilarly demonstrated the improved prognostic value of the IPSS -R in 370 \npatients with t -MDS compared to the IPSS, the global MD Anderson risk \nmodel, or the t -MDS MD Anderson model .198 Further studies are \nwarranted to better evaluate the impact of specific therapies and more \nrefined variables and their cut points  for analysis of this heterogeneous \ngroup of patients.  \nOther studies have confirmed the value of the IPSS -R in treated as well \nas untreated patients.195,199- 201 Since more accurate risk stratification by the IPSS -R compared to the IPSS and WPSS has been demonstrated,199 \nthe IPSS -R categorization is preferred, although other systems have \ngood value. It is understood that some ongoing studies are using the IPSS or WPSS. Thus, a transition period is expected before more \nuniform prognostic risk stratification is accepted by the field.  An analysis \nof patients in the International Working Group (IWG) for the Prognosis of MDS database, which generated the IPSS -R, indicated that optimal \nprognostic separation of lower versus higher -risk MDS  was obtained by a \ndichotomization based on 3.5 scoring points of the IPSS -R raw score (ie, \n≤3.5 vs. >3.5).\n202  \nWPSS  \nData have indicated a benefit to the addition of other clinical variables to \nthe IPSS to improve the accuracy of prognosis. The WHO \nclassification -based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) incorporates the \nWHO morphologic categories, the IPSS cytogenetic categories, and the \ndegree of RBC transfusion dependence.203 This system demonstrated that \nthe requirement  for RBC transfusions is a negative prognostic factor for \npatients in the lower -risk MDS categories. In addition, depth of anemia per \nse has additive and negative prognostic importance for the intermediate \nIPSS categories.204 As compared with the four groups defined by the \nIPSS, the WPSS classifies patients into five risk groups differing in both survival and risk of AML. The five risk groups are: very low, low, \nintermediate, high, and very high. Following the initial report by Malcovati \net al,\n203 there have been confirmatory studies demonstrating the \nusefulness of the WPSS.205-207 The initial WPSS has been refined to \naddress the notion that the requirement for RBC transfusion may be \nsomewhat subjective. In the refined WPSS, the measure of the degree of \nanemia by transfusion dependency is replaced by the presence (or \nabsence) of sev ere anemia, defined as hemoglobin levels < 9 g/dL for \nmales and < 8 g/dL for females.208 This approach allows for an objective \nassessment of anemia, while maintaining the prognostic implications of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-18 the five risk categories defined in the original WPSS (as mentioned \nabove).208  \nIPSS- M \nThe international prognostic scoring system molecular (IPSS -M) is a \nprognostic model that takes into account blood counts, marrow blasts, IPSS- R cytogenetic  risk categories, 16 main effect genes, and 15 residual \ngenes and provides time estimates for OS, LFS, and AML transformation.\n209 Data from 2957 patients with MDS, including those with \nsecondary or therapy -related MDS and MDS/MPN overlap syndromes, \nwere used to identify six risk categories (very low, low, moderate low, \nmoderate high, high, very high). The median OS was 10.6 years for the \nvery low-risk category, 6.0 for low risk, 4.6 for moderate low  risk, 2.8 years \nfor moderate high risk , 1.7 for high risk, and 1.0 for very high risk . The \nmedian LFS was 9.7 ( very low risk ), 5.9 (low risk), 4.5 ( moderate low  risk), \n2.3 (moderate high risk ), 1.5 (high risk), and 0.76 years ( very high risk) \nrespectively. The model was validated in a cohort of 754 Japanese \npatients. The Panel notes that the IPSS -M may have a role in improving \nclinical decision -making but requires confirmatory evidence to help assess \nits efficacy.  \nLR-PSS \nThe Lower -Risk Prognostic Scoring System (LR -PSS) is a prognostic \nmodel used in the evaluation of MDS, and was designed to help identify patients with lower -risk disease (IPSS low or int -1) who may have a poor \nprognosis.\n210 The prognostic model was developed using clinical and \nlaboratory data from patients with IPSS low - (n = 250) and int -1– (n = 606) \nrisk MDS. Factors associated with decreased survival were identified and \na prognostic model was constructed based on the results of multivariate \nCox regression analysis. The final model included the following factors \nthat were independent predictors for survival outcomes: unfavorable \ncytogenetics, older age ( ≥60 years), decreased hemoglobin (<10 g/dL), decreased platelet count ( <200 x 109/L), and higher percentage of bone \nmarrow blasts (≥4%). Importantly, the cytogenetic categories in this \nsystem were derived from the previously defined IPSS categories rather \nthan from the more refined IPSS -R. Each of these factors was given a \nweighted score, and the sum of the scores (range, 0– 7 points) was used \nto generate three risk categories: a score of 0 to 2 points was assigned to \ncategory 1, a score of 3 or 4 was assigned to category 2, and a score of 5 \nto 7 was assigned to category 3. Usi ng this scoring system, median \nsurvival was 80.3 months for category 1, 26.6 months for category 2, and 14.2 months for category 3; the 4- year survival rates were 65%, 33%, and \n7%, respectively. The scoring system allowed for further stratification into these three risk categories for both the IPSS low -risk and IPSS int -1–risk \nsubgroups. The LR -PSS may be useful in identifying patients with \nlower -risk disease who have poorer prognosis and require earlier \ntreatment.  \nThe prognostic value of the LR -PSS has been validated in several \nindependent studies.\n66,194,211- 213 In a retrospective analysis of data from  \npatients  with lower -risk MDS  (IPSS low or int -1) in the multicenter Spanish \nregistry (N  = 2373), the LR -PSS was able to further stratify patients with  \nlower -risk disease  into three  risk categories.194 Within the IPSS low -risk \ngroup, median survival was 130.3 months for category 1 (low risk), 69.7 \nmonths for category 2 (intermediate risk), and 58.4 months for category 3 \n(high risk) using the LR -PSS– risk categories ( P < .001); the corresponding \nmedian survival values within the IPSS int -1–risk group using the LR -PSS \nrisk categories were 115.2 months, 51.3 months, and 24.1 months, \nrespectively ( P < .001). An important proportion of patients (30%) within \nthe IPSS int -1–risk group were identified as having a poorer prognosis as \nindicated by their inclusion in the high- risk group (24.1 months).  \nData from a cohort of patients with lower -risk MDS from two centers \n(N = 664) demonstrated a median survival according to the LR -PSS risk PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-19 categories of 91.4 months for category 1, 35.6 months for category 2, and \n22 months for category 3.213 Using data from the same cohort of patients, \nmedian survival according to the IPSS -R–risk groups was 91.4 months for \nIPSS- R very good, 35.9 months for good, and 27.8 months for the \ncombined intermediate- , high- , and very -high– risk groups. Both of these \nprognostic scoring systems were significantly predictive of survival \noutcomes. The predictive powers (based on Harrell’s C statistics) of the \nLR-PSS and IPSS -R were 0.64 and 0.63, respectively.  \nMolecular Abnormalities in MDS \nSeveral gene mutations have been identified among patients with MDS \nthat may, in part, contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of the disease \ncourse, and thereby influence the prognosis of patients. Such gene \nmutations will be present in the majority of newly diagnosed patients, \nincluding most patients with normal cytogenetics. Several studies \nexamining large numbers of MDS tumor samples have identified more \nthan 40 recurrently mutated genes with > 80% of patients harboring at \nleast one mutation.66,214- 216 The most frequently mutated genes were \nTET2, SF3B1 , ASXL1 , DNMT3A , SRSF2 , RUNX1 , TP53, U2AF1, EZH2 , \nZRSR2 , STAG2 , CBL, NRAS , JAK2 , SETBP1 , IDH1, IDH2, and ETV6 , \nalthough no single mutated gene was found in more than one  third of \npatients. Several of these gene mutations are associated with adverse \nclinical features such as complex karyotypes ( TP53), excess bone marrow \nblast proportion ( RUNX1 , NRAS , and TP53), and severe \nthrombocytopenia ( RUNX1 , NRAS , and  TP53).  See the IPSS- M section \nabove and Prognostic Scoring Systems in the algorithm for a discussion of \nmutational changes in MDS as noted in the IPSS -M.209 \nDespite associations with clinical features considered by prognostic \nscoring systems, mutations in several genes hold independent prognostic \nvalue. Mutations of TP53 , EZH2 , ETV6 , RUNX1 , and ASXL1  have been \nshown to predict decreased OS in multivariable models adjusted for IPSS or IPSS- R risk groups in several studies of distinct cohorts.214,216 Within \nIPSS risk groups, a mutation in one or more of these genes identifies \npatients whose survival risk resembles that of patients in the next highest \nIPSS risk group (eg, the survival curve for patients with int -1–risk disease \nwith an adverse gene mutation was similar to that of patients assigned to the int -2–risk group by the IPSS).\n214 When applied to patients stratified by \nthe IPSS- R, the presence of a mutation in one or more of these five genes \nwas associated with shorter OS for patients in the low - and intermediate-\nrisk groups.216 Thus, the combined analysis of these gene mutations and \nthe IPSS or IPSS- R may improve upon the risk stratification provided by \nthese prognostic models alone. Mutations of ASXL1  have also been \nshown to carry independent adverse prognostic significance in \nCMML.217,218 Other mutated genes have been associated with decreased \nOS, including DNMT3A , U2AF1, SRSF2 , CBL, PRPF8 , SETBP1 , and \nKRAS.214,216,219- 223 Only mutations of SF3B1  have been associated with a \nmore favorable prognosis even after adjustment for the IPSS -R in several, \nbut not all studies.216,224,225  \nTET2 mutations have been shown to impact the response to HMAs .226,227 \nPatients with mutated TET2 had an 82% response rate to AzaC compared \nto 45% of patients with wild- type TET2 (P = .007). Response duration and \nOS were not statistically different.226 Another study identified 39 genes that \nwere mutated in 213 patients with MDS treated with AzaC or decitabine.227 \nA higher response to HMAs  in patients with the TET2  mutation, albeit to a \nlesser degree, was seen (response rate, 55% vs. 44%; P  = .14). This \nimproved response was more pronounced when patients with ASXL1  \nmutations and those with only low abundance TET2 mutations were \nexcluded (OR, 3.65; P  = .009). Mutations in TP53  and PTPN11  correlated \nwith shorter OS but did not affect drug response. However, the predictive \ncapabilities of these mutations are modest. The status of these molecular \nmarkers in patients should not preclude the use of HMAs  nor be used to \ninfluence the  selection of HMAs.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-20 Mutations of TP53  are strongly associated with complex and monosomal \nkaryotypes. However, approximately 50% of patients with a complex \nkaryotype have no detectable TP53 abnormality and have an OS that is \ncomparable to that of patients with non -complex karyotypes. Therefore, \nTP53 mutation status may be useful for refining the prognosis of these \npatients typically considered to have higher -risk disease.214 Patients with \ndel(5q), either as an isolated abnormality or often as part of a complex \nkaryotype, have a higher rate of concomitant TP53  mutations.228,229 These \nmutations are associated with diminished response or relapse after \ntreatment with lenalidomide.230,231 In these cases, TP53 mutations may be \nsecondary events and are often present in small subclones that can \nexpand during treatment. More sensitive techniques may be required to \nidentify the presence of subclonal, low -abundance TP53 mutations prior to \ntreatment.  \nMutations identified in peripheral blood samples can accurately reflect \nmutations detected in the bone marrow of patients with MDS when more \nsensitive sequencing techniques are used to detect them.232 \nComorbidity Indices  \nPatients with MDS predominantly comprise an older  adult population, \nposing potential challenges in terms of treatment tolerability and outcomes \ndue to the presence of comorbid conditions. Approximately  50% of \npatients with newly diagnosed MDS present with one or more comorbidities, with cardiac disease and diabetes among the most \nfrequently observed conditions.\n233- 237 Assessment of the presence and \ndegree of comorbidities using tools such as the Charlson Comorbidity \nIndex (CCI) or the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation- Specific \nComorbidity Index (HCT- CI) has demonstrated the significant prognostic \ninfluence of comorbidities on the survival outcome of patients with \nMDS.233,235- 237 Some studies have shown that comorbidity (as measured \nby HCT -CI or Adult Comorbidity Evaluation- 27 [ACE -27]) was a significant prognostic factor for survival, independent of IPSS.234,237 In these studies, \ncomorbidity indices provided additional prognostic information for survival \noutcomes in patients with MDS categorized as IPSS intermediate or high \nrisk, but not for patients considered to have low -risk disease.  \nConversely, in another study, comorbidity (as measured by HCT- CI or \nCCI) was a significant predictor of OS and event -free survival in patients \nwithin the low -risk or int -1–risk groups, but not in the int -2–risk or high- risk \ngroups.235 Comorbidity has also been shown to provide additional risk \nstratification among WPSS risk categories (for very low -, low- , and \nintermediate- risk groups but not for high-  or very -high- risk groups), \nprompting the development of a new MDS -specific comorbidit ies index \nthat can be used in conjunction with WPSS for the assessment of prognosis.\n238 Improved risk stratification has also been demonstrated with \nthe incorporation of the Myelodysplastic Syndromes Comorbidity Index \nwith the IPSS -R.201 At this time, the NCCN MDS Panel makes no specific \nrecommendations with regard to the optimal comorbidity index to be used for patients with MDS. However, a thorough evaluation of the presence \nand extent of comorbid conditions remains an important aspect of \ntreatment decision- making and management of MDS.  \nTherapeutic Options  \nThe IPSS or IPSS- R risk categories are used in the initial planning of \ntherapeutic options, because they provide a risk -based patient evaluation. \nIn addition, factors such as patient age, performance status, and presence \nof comorbidities have a major influence on the patient's ability to tolerate \ncertain intensive treatments  and play a major role in selecting the optimal \nmanagement strategy . The WPSS provides dynamic estimation of \nprognosis at any time during the course of MDS.  \nIf the patient was only recently evaluated, determining the relative stability \nof the patient’s blood counts over several months is important to assess PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

The patient’s preference for a specific approach \nis also important in deciding treatm ent options. The therapeutic options for \nMDS include supportive care, low -intensity therapy, high- intensity therapy \nincluding allogeneic HCT, targeted agents, and participation in a clinical \ntrial. In evaluating results of therapeutic trials, the Panel found it important \nfor studies to use the standardized IWG response criteria.239- 244 \nFor the MDS therapeutic algorithm, all patients should receive relevant supportive care. Following that, the MDS Panel has proposed stratifying \npatients with clinically significant cytopenia(s) into two major risk groups: \n1) patients with lower -risk MDS (ie, IPSS low, int -1; IPSS- R very low, low, \nintermediate; WPSS very low, low, intermediate); and 2) patients with higher -risk MDS (ie, IPSS int -2, high; IPSS -R intermediate, high, very \nhigh; WPSS high, very high). Patients with IPSS -R intermediate risk may \nbe treated  as lower risk if their score is ≤3.5 versus  higher risk if their \nscore is >3.5.\n202 In addition, patients with intermediate- risk disease that \ndoes not respond to therapy for lower -risk disease would be eligible to \nreceive therapy for higher -risk MDS.  \nBased on IWG response criteria, the major therapeutic aim for patients in \nthe lower -risk group would be hematologic improvement, whereas for \nthose in the higher -risk group, alteration of the natural history of disease is \nviewed as paramount. Cytogenetic response and quality -of-life (QOL) \nparameters are  also important outcomes to assess. The algorithm outlines \nmanagement of primary  MDS only. Most patients with t -MDS have poorer \nprognoses than those with primary MDS, including a substantial proportion with po or-risk cytogenetics. This disease is  generally managed as \nhigher -risk disease.  Supportive Care  \nCurrently, the standard of care for MDS management includes  supportive \ncare measures (see Supportive Care in the algorithm and the NCCN \nGuidelines for Supportive Care)  in addition to relevant specific care. This \nentails observation,  clinical monitoring, psychosocial support, and QOL \nassessment. Patients should receive support prior to transplant.   \nSupportive care should include RBC transfusions for symptomatic anemia \nas needed (CMV -safe [CMV -negative or leukopheresed] ) or platelet \ntransfusions for bleeding events; however, platelet transfusions are \ngenerally not  used routinely in patients with thrombocytopenia in the \nabsence of bleeding. CMV -safe blood products are recommended \nwhenever possible for recipients who are CMV -negative. Both the number \nof transfusions as well as the number of packed RBCs per transfusion \nshould be kept to a minimum in patients who are classified as non- cardiac \nand in patients anticipated to be heavily transfused. The NCCN Guidelines \nPanel is in agreement with the 2013 American Society of Hematology \n(ASH) Choosing Wis ely initiative addres sing hematologic tests and \ntreatments.245 There was non- uniform consensus among the Panel \nmembers based on differing institutional policies regarding the necessity \nfor routine irradiation of blood products used in patients with MDS; \nhowever, the P anel agreed that all directed- donor products and transfused \nproducts for patients who are potential transplant candidates  should be \nirradiated. Additionally, CMV -safe (CMV -negative or leukopheresed) blood \nproducts are recommended whenever possible for recipients who are CMV -negative. Antibiotics are recom mended for bacterial infections and \nprophylaxis may be considered when starting patients on therapy, consistent with local hospital guidelines. Aminocaproic acid or other \nantifibrinolytic agents may be considered for bleeding episodes refractory \nto platelet transfusions or for profound thrombocytopenia.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-22 stimulating factor (G -CSF) treatment could be considered for patients with \nMDS with neutropenia with recurrent or resistant bacterial infections.  \nPost-transplantation, patients should receive antimicrobial  prophylaxis at \nleast as long as they are on immunosuppressive therapy. Detailed \nrecommendations are provided in the Guidelines generated by the \nAmerican Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy247 and the \nNCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.  \nManagement of Thrombocytopenia  \nSevere thrombocytopenia is associated with an increased risk for bleeding events and  is currently managed with platelet transfusions. The \nmechanism of thrombocytopenia in patients with MDS may be attributed to \ndecreased platelet production (possibly related to regulatory pathways \ninvolving the production and/or metabolism of endogenous th rombopoietin \n[TPO]) as well as increased destruction of bone marrow megakaryocytes \nor circulating platelets.\n248,249 Increased endogenous TPO levels have been \nreported among patients with MDS compared with healthy individuals.249 \nAt the same time, TPO receptor sites per platelet were decreased among patients with MDS compared to healthy individuals . The RA subgroup (as \ndefined by Bennett et al\n250) appeared to have the highest TPO levels \ncompared with patients with MDS -EB or MDS -EB-T, while the number of \nTPO receptor sites remained similar across subtypes.249 Studies have \nreported that high endogenous TPO levels correlated with decreased \nplatelet counts in patients with RA, but not in patients with MDS -EB or \nMDS -EB-T.249,251 This observation suggests that the regulatory pathway \nfor endogenous TPO may be further disrupted in the latter group, \npotentially due to overexpression of TPO receptors in blasts that could \nlead to an inadequate TPO response.249,251 \nSeveral studies are investigating the role of the TPO receptor agonist \nromiplostim in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with \nlower -risk MDS.252- 257 Phase I/II studies with romiplostim showed promising rates of platelet response (46% –65%) in patients with lower -risk \nMDS.253,255 Randomized placebo- controlled studies in patients treated for \nlower -risk MDS have reported beneficial effects of romiplostim in terms of \ndecreased bleeding events, reduced need for platelet transfusions in \npatients receiving HMAs ,252,254 and decreased frequency of dose \nreductions or delays in patients receiving lenalidomide therapy.256 In a \nrandomized study including patients with low - or int -1–risk MDS (n  = 250), \nromiplostim was associated with increased platelet counts and decreased overall bleeding events ( P = .026 after 58 weeks of treatment compared to \nthe placebo group).\n258 However, due to the early drug discontinuation, \ninterpretation of these data is limited. Following up on previous \nstudies,253,258 an open- label extension study evaluated the long- term \nsafety and efficacy of romiplostim in 60 patients with lower -risk MDS and \nfound that most patients achieved durable responses.259 A model to \npredict response to romiplostim indicated that lower -risk MDS, lower \nbaseline TPO levels (<500 pg/mL), and limited platelet transfusion history \nhad the greatest effect on subsequent platelet response to romiplostim.257 \nEltrombopag is another TPO receptor agonist that has been shown to \nincrease normal megakaryopoiesis in vitro in bone marrow cells isolated \nfrom patients with MDS.260,261 Ongoing phase I and II clinical trials are \ninvestigating the activity and safety of this agent for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with lower -risk MDS. A phase II study \nenrolled patients with low- risk or IPSS int-1 risk MDS with severe \nthrombocytopenia who were randomized 2:1 to receive eltrombopag or \nplacebo.\n262 In the interim analysis, 42.3%  of patients treated with \neltrombopag demonstrated a platelet response, compared to 11.1%  of \nthose treated with placebo (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.3 –14.9;  P < .001 ). In the \neltrombopag arm, the platelet response was not maintained in 25.5%  of \npatients. At 60 months, the cumulative thrombocytopenia relapse -free \nsurvival (RFS) rate was 63.6% . Fewer clinically significant bleeding \nevents were reported in the eltrombopag arm compared to the placebo PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

Grade 3–\n4 adverse events occurred more frequently in the eltrombopag arm ( P = \n.002). The results from another phase II trial determined that \neltrombopag monotherapy in patients with lower -risk MDS with \ncytopenia, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia, led to a \n44% rate of hematologic response at 16 to 20 weeks.263 A few patients \nacquired chromosomal abnormalities. A study by Fan et al264 found that \n50% of patients with moderate aplastic anemia or unilineage  cytopenias \n(platelet count <30 x 109/L or dependence on platelet transfusions or \nhemoglobin count <8.5 g/dL or dependence on RBC transfusions) \ntreated with eltrombopag achieved a clinically meaningful response at 16 to 20 weeks. Out of 34 patients, two patients acquired cytogenetic \nabnormalities.   \nA phase II trial evaluated  eltrombopag monotherapy or eltrombopag in \ncombination with HMAs  in adults who have had >4 cycles of HMAs  but \nwho have disease that fails to respond to treatment or disease that \ncontinues to have ongoing cytopenias.\n265,266 Out of 28 evaluable patients, \nthree  of those who received the combination treatment showed platelet \nimprovement and three  had progressive disease.  The median OS was 12 \nmonths.  The phase II ASPIRE trial evaluated eltrombopag monotherapy \nfor thrombocytopenia in adult patients with intermediate- 2 or high- risk \nMDS and AML.267 Patients on eltrombopag monotherapy experienced \nsignificantly fewer clinically relevant thrombocytopenic events compared to those on placebo. However, there was no improvement in hematologic \nparameters or in platelet transfusion independence.  \nConcerns for potential proliferation of leukemic blasts in response to exogenous TPO have been raised in earlier in vitro studies, particularly for \nhigh- risk MDS.\n268,269 Results from ongoing clinical trials with TPO mimetics \nwill help to elucidate the risks for leukemic transformations in patients with MDS. It should be noted that neither romiplostim nor eltrombopag is \ncurrently approved for use in patients with MDS.  \nManagement of Iron Overload  \nRBC transfusions are a key component in the supportive care of patients \nwith MDS. Although the specific therapies patients receive may alleviate \nRBC transfusion need, a substantial proportion of patients with MDS may \nnot respond to these treatments and may develop iron overload and its \nconsequences.270 Thus, effective treatment of transfusional siderosis in \npatients with MDS may be necessary.  \nStudies in patients requiring relatively large numbers of RBC transfusions \n(eg, thalassemia, MDS) have demonstrated the pathophysiology and \nadverse effects of chronic iron overload on hepatic, cardiac, and endocrine \nfunction. Increased non- transferrin –bound iron, generated when plasma \niron exceeds transferrin -binding capacity, combines with oxygen to form \nhydroxyl and oxygen radicals. These toxic elements cause lipid \nperoxidation and cell membrane, protein, DNA, and organ damage.271,272 \nAlthough limited, there is evidence suggesting that organ dysfunction can \nresult from iron overload in patients with MDS.273- 275 Retrospective data \nindicate that transfusional iron overload might be a contributor of \nincreased mortality and morbidity in early -stage MDS.276 The WPSS has \nshown that the requirement for RBC transfusion is a negative prognostic \nfactor for patients with MDS.203 A few studies have reported an \nimprovement in OS for patients receiving iron chelation therapy compared \nto those who did not.277- 279 However, prospective studies are required to \nsubstantiate the value of iron chelation in these patients.  \nA randomized prospective trial with 225 patients with lower -risk MDS \n(IPSS low or int -1) and serum ferritin levels >2247 pmol/L  demonstrated \nthe benefit of iron chelation therapy.280 Compared to patients in the \nplacebo arm (n = 76), patients in the deferasirox arm (n = 149) had a PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-24 higher median event -free survival (3.9 years [95% CI, 3.2– 4.3 years] vs. \n3.0 years [95% CI, 2.2– 3.7 years]; hazard ratio [ HR] = .64 [95% CI, 0.42–\n0.96]). The median OS was 5.2 years (95% CI, 3.9 years –not evaluable) \nand 4.1 years ( 95% CI, 3.0 –4.9 years) for the deferasirox arm and the \nplacebo arm respectively (HR = .83; 95% CI, .54– 1.28). Per the IWG 2006 \nresponse criteria, the hematologic improvement in erythroid response was \nachieved in 39.6% (95% CI, 31.4% –47.8%) of patients treated with \ndeferasirox compared to 27.6% (95% CI, 16.9% –38.3%) of patients \ntreated with placebo.  \nFor patients with chronic RBC transfusion need, serum ferritin levels and associated organ dysfunction (heart, liver, and pancreas) should be \nmonitored. The NCCN Panel Members recommend monitoring serum \nferritin levels and number of RBC transfusions receiv ed as a practical \nmeans to determine iron stores and assess iron overload. Monitoring serum ferritin may be useful, aiming to decrease ferritin levels to <1000 \nmcg/L. Beyond this level, serum ferritin can negatively impact the OS of \npatients with MDS.\n281 It is recognized that such measurements, al though \nuseful, are less precise than Superconducting Quantum Interference \nDevice  (SQUID ), or T2* MRI, to provide a specific measurement of hepatic \niron content.282,283  \nReversal of some of the consequences of iron overload in MDS and other \niron overload states by iron chelation therapy has been shown in patients \nin whom the most effective chelation occurred.241,272 This included \ntransfusion independence (TI) in a subset of the small group of patients with MDS who had undergone effective deferoxamine chelation for 1 to 4 \nyears.\n284 In addition, improvement in cardiac iron content was \ndemonstrated in these patients after chelation.285 Such findings have \nmajor implications for altering the morbidity of patients with MDS, \nparticularly those with pre- existing cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.  The availability of iron chelators, such as deferoxamine and \ndeferasirox,286,287 provide potentially useful drugs to more readily treat iron \noverload.  Deferoxamine (given as intramuscular or subcutaneous [SC] \ninjections) is FDA -indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due \nto transfusion- dependent (TD) anemias. Deferasirox (given orally) is FDA -\nindicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood \ntransfusions. Deferasirox has been evaluated in multiple phase II clinical \ntrials in patients with TD -MDS.288- 290 A randomized phase II study \nevaluated the outcomes of deferasirox compared to placebo in patients with low- to intermediate -1–risk MDS.\n280 The results demonstrated that \ndeferasirox prolonged the median event -free survival by approximately 1 \nyear.280 The prescribing information for deferasirox contains a black -box \nwarning pertaining to the increased risks for renal or hepatic impairment/failure and GI bleeding in certain patient populations, including \npatients with high- risk MDS. Deferasirox is contraindicated in patients with \nhigh- risk MDS.  \nA third oral chelating agent, deferiprone, was U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration ( FDA)-approved (October 2011) in the United States for the \ntreatment of patients with transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia when current chelation therapy is inadequate. The FDA approval was \nbased on results from a retrospective analysis of data pooled from previous safety and efficacy studies of deferiprone in patients with \ntransfusion- related iron overload refractory to existing chelation therapy. \nThe prescribing inf ormation for deferiprone contains a black -box warning \npertaining to risks for agranulocytosis , which can lead to serious infections \nand death. Controversy remains regarding the use of this agent.  The \nNCCN Task Force report, Transfusion and Iron Overload in Patients with \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes , provides detailed evidence regarding iron \nchelation in patients with MDS.\n291 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-25 The NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends consideration of once- daily \ndeferoxamine SC or deferasirox/ICL670 orally to decrease iron overload in \npatients who have received > 20 to 30 RBC transfusions, particularly for \nthose who have lower -risk MDS or who are potential transplant candidates \n(with Low/int-1 MDS). For patients with serum ferritin levels > 2500 ng/mL, \naim to  decrease ferritin levels to < 1000 ng/mL.  Ophthalmic and auditory \ntests are recommended annually when using deferasirox. Serum \ncreatinine should be  monitored regularly upon starting deferasirox.  \nAs mentioned above, a black -box warning was added to the prescribing \ninformation for deferasirox. Following post -marketing use of deferasirox, \nthere were case reports of acute renal failure, or hepatic failure, some of which were fatal. Most of the fatalit ies reported were in patients with \nmultiple comorbidities and in advanced stages of their hematologic disorders. Additionally, there were post -marketing reports of cytopenias, \nincluding agranulocytosis, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, and GI bleeding in patients treated with deferasirox; some cases resulted in \ndeath. The relationship of these episodes to treatment with deferasirox \nhas not yet been established. However, it is recommended that patients \non deferasirox therapy be closely monitored. Monitoring should include measurement of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance and liver \nfunction tests prior to initiation of therapy and regularly thereafter. \nDeferasirox and deferoxamine should be avoided in patients with creatinine clearance <40 mL/min.\n292 A phase IV study with 61 patients with \nMDS or AA determined that the adverse events noted within a 3- year \nperiod were largely mild or moderate.293 \nTreatment of Related Anemia  \nErythropoiesis -stimulating agents (ESAs) such as  epoetin alfa  or the \nlonger -acting darbepoetin, with or without G -CSF, have been evaluated in \nthe treatment of symptomatic anemia in patients with MDS. Studies predominantly in patients with lower -risk MDS have demonstrated erythroid response rates of 40% and 60% (combined major and minor \nresponses using IWG response criteria) in the initial trials.\n294,295 Clinical \ntrial results in patients with MDS have suggested that the overall response rates to darbepoetin are similar to or possibly higher than epoetin.\n294- 297 \nThe improved response rates may in part be due to the dosage used \n(150– 300 mcg SC per week) or to the fact that patients with better risk  \nwere enrolled in studies of darbepoetin compared to epoetin. Features predictive of response have included relatively low basal sE PO levels, low \npercentage of marrow blasts, and few prior RBC transfusions.  \nIn a phase II study of patients with MDS (RA, MDS -RS, and MDS -EB; \nN = 50), Epo combined with G -CSF (n  = 47 evaluable) resulted in \nhematologic responses in 38% of patients (complete response [CR], \n21%).\n298 Epo and G -CSF appeared to have synergistic activity. Lower \nsEPO levels (<500 mU/mL) and a lower pretreatment RBC transfusion \nrequirement (<2 units per month) were associated with a higher response \nrate; response rates were not significantly different across IPSS risk \ngroups. Median survival, including in patients from  a prior study, was 26 \nmonths (N  = 71). Among patients with low -risk IPSS, median survival had \nnot been reached at 5 years; the 5- year survival rate was 68%. Median \nsurvival times among the int -1– and int -2–risk groups were 27 months and \n14 months, respectively. AML progression occurred in 28% of patients \noverall during the observation period. The frequency of AML progression \nin the low -, int-1–, int-2–, and high- risk groups were 12%, 21%, 45%,  and \n100%, respectively. Among patients with responding disease who received maintenance treatment with Epo and G -CSF, the median \nduration of response was 24 months.  \nA subsequent analysis of combined data from three phase II Nordic trials \n(n = 121) on the long- term outcomes with Epo plus G -CSF (given for 12–\n18 weeks and followed by maintenance in responders) in patients with \nMDS reported a hematologic response rate of 39% with a median duration PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

Based on \nmultivariate Cox regression analysis, treatment with Epo plus G -CSF was \nassociated with a significantly improved survival outcome ( HR, 0.61; 95% \nCI, 0.44 –0.83; P = .002). An exploratory analysis revealed that the \nassociation between treatment and survival was significant only for the \nIPSS low -risk group and was further restricted to patients requiring fewer \nthan 2 units of RBC transfusions per month. No s ignificant association was \nfound between the treatment and frequency of AML progression.  \nSimilar findings were reported in a study from the French myelodysplasia \ngroup, which analyzed outcomes with ESAs (epoetin or darbepoetin), with \nor without G -CSF, in patients with MDS with anemia (N  = 403).300 Based \non the IWG 2000 criteria, the hematologic response rate was 62% with a median duration of 20 months; the corresponding results from the IWG \n2006 criteria were 50% and 24 months, respectively. IPSS low - or int -1-\nrisk was associated with significantly higher response rates and longer response durations. In a comparison of outcomes (in the low - or int -1-risk \nsubset with anemia) between treated patients (n  = 284) and a historical \ncohort of untreated patients (n = 225), multivariate analysis showed a \nsignificant association between treatment with ESAs and survival \noutcomes. The frequency of AML progression was similar between the \ncohorts. In a phase II study that evaluated darbepoetin (given every 2 \nweeks for 12 weeks), with or without G -CSF (added at 12 weeks in \nnon-responders), patients in the lower -risk IPSS group with anemia (and \nsEPO levels <500 mU/mL) had hematologic response rates of 48% at 12 \nweeks and 56% at 24 we eks.\n301 Median duration of response was not \nreached at the median follow -up of 52 months. The 3- year cumulative \nincidence of AML progression was 14.5%, and the 3- year survival rate \nwas 70%. This study also showed improvements in QOL parameters \namong patients with responding disease.301 Collectively, these studies suggest that ESAs may provide clinical benefit \nto patients in the lower -risk group with symptomatic anemia. Limited data \nare available on the effectiveness of ESAs in the treatment of anemia in patients with lower -risk MDS  with del(5q). Epo has been shown to promote \nthe growth of cytogenetically normal cells isolated from patients with del(5q), while having minimal proliferative effects on MDS progenitor cells \nfrom these patients in vitro.\n302 Retrospective studies from the French \ngroup reported hematologic response rates between 46% and 64%, with a median response duration of 11 months (mean duration, 13– 14 months) \namong patients with del(5q) treated with ESAs, with or without G-CSF.\n300,303 Duration of response in these patients was significantly \ndecreased compared with patients without del(5q) (mean duration, 25 –27 \nmonths). Based on multivariate analysis, del(5q) was a significant \npredictor of a shorter response duration with treatment (see Prognostic \nCategory Very Low, Low, Intermediate -1 Treatment  in the algorithm).300 \nIn March 2007 and 2008, the FDA announced alerts and strengthened \nsafety warnings for the use of ESAs based on observed increased \nmortality and possible tumor promotion and thromboembolic events in \nnon-MDS patients  receiving ESAs when dosing to achieve a targeted \nhemoglobin level > 12 g/dL. Specifically, the study patients had chronic \nkidney failure; were receiving radiation therapy for various malignancies, \nincluding head and neck cancer, advanced breast cancer, lymphoid \ncancer, or non- small cell lung cancer; were patients with cancer not \nreceiving chemotherapy; or were patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. However, ESAs have been used safely in large numbers of adult patients \nwith MDS and have become important for symptomatic improvement of \nanemia caused by this disease, often with a decrease in RBC transfusion \nrequirements. Studies assessing the long- term use of Epo with or without \nG-CSF in patients with MDS have shown no negative impact of such \ntreatment on su rvival or AML evolution when compared to either \nrandomized controls\n304 or historical controls.299,300  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-27 Jadersten et al299 reported improved survival in patients with low- risk MDS \nwith low transfusion need following treatment with these agents. In another \nstudy, improved survival and decreased AML progression of patients with \nIPSS low or int -1 following Epo treatment, with or without G -CSF, \ncompared to the historical control IMRAW database patients were \nreported.300 Thus, these data do not indicate a negative impact of these \ndrugs in the treatment of MDS. Given these data, the NCCN Panel \nrecommends the use of ESAs in the management of symptomatic anemia \nin patients with MDS, with a target hemoglobin range of 10 to 12 g/dL but \nnot exceeding  12 g/dL.  \nThe phase III randomized COMMANDS trial evaluated the use of \nluspatercept in patients with no del(5q) with IPSS -R very -low risk, low-\nrisk, or intermediate- risk MDS (73% of whom had ring sideroblasts)  with \nno prior ESA treatment, with sEPO <500 mU/mL, and with RBC \ntransfusion requirements .305 Data from the primary analysis revealed that \n60% of patients receiving luspatercept achieved the primary endpoint of \nRBC transfusion independence for ≥12 weeks with a concurrent mean \nhemoglobin increase of ≥1.5 g/dL, compared to 35% of patients receiving \nepoetin alfa ( P < .0001). In patients with RS -positive disease, response \nrates for the primary endpoint were 65% with luspatercept versus 29% with epoetin alfa, but in those with RS -negative disease, response rates \nwere similar, 47% with luspatercept versus 50% for epoet in alfa. \nHowever, of note, t he mean duration of response in these patients was \n126.6 weeks with luspatercept and 89.7 weeks with epoetin alfa. In a subgroup analysis, in patients with sEPO ≤200 mU/mL, the response \nrate for the primary endpoint was 66% in t he luspatercept arm versus \n41% in the epoetin arm. Overall, the most common grade 3– 4 TEAEs in \nthe luspatercept arm included hypertension and anemia (10% each). For epoetin alfa, anemia and pneumonia (8% each) were the most common \ngrade 3– 4 TEAEs.   Clinical trials with other experimental agents that are reportedly capable of \nincreasing hemoglobin levels should be explored in patients with disease \nthat is not responding to standard therapy. These drugs should be used in \nthe context of therapeutic appr oaches for the underlying prognostic risk \ngroup.  \nIn March 2007, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \ngenerated a National Coverage Determination (NCD) on the use of ESAs \nin non- renal disease applications. Following a public comment period, it \nwas determined that the scope of the NCD should be revised to include \ncancer and related neoplastic conditions. The narrowed scope of the NCD \nexcludes MDS as it is defined in the report as a premalignant condition \nand not an oncologic disease.\n306 Thus, local Medicare contractors may \ncontinue to make reasonable and necessary determinations on the use of ESAs that are not determined by the NCD.  \nTreatment of MDS -Related ESA-Refractory Anemia \nAnemia associated with lower -risk MDS generally becomes resistant to \navailable treatment, leading to a dependence on RBC transfusions, iron \noverload, and decreased QOL  and survival.189,307- 309 In November 2019, \nthe FDA approved the use of luspatercept for the treatment of anemia in \nadult patients with beta thalassemia who require regular RBC \ntransfusions. Luspatercept is a recombinant fusion protein made up of a \nmodified extracellular domain of the human activin receptor type IIB linked \nto the human IgG1 Fc domain that binds transforming growth factor bet a \n(TGFβ)  ligands to reduce SMAD2 and SMAD3 signaling, which enables \nerythroid mat uration.310 In April 2020, based on encouraging phase III \ndata,309 the FDA approved luspatercept for the treatment of anemia in \npatients with lower -risk MDS with RS that failed treatment with ESAs.

During \nweeks 1 through 24 of treatment, 38% of patients in the luspatercept \ngroup, compared to 13% of those in the placebo group, met the study \nprimary endpoint of transfusion independence for 8 weeks or longer  (P < \n.001).  The median duration of the longest single continuous period of \nresponse to luspatercept was 30.6 weeks. The most common adverse \nevents associated with luspat ercept included fatigue, diarrhea, asthenia, \nnausea, and dizziness, which decreased over time.  Additionally, 81.0% of \npatients in the luspatercept group met the secondary endpoint of a mean \nabsolute increase in neutrophil  count  of ≥0.5 x 109/L from baseline \ncompared to 51.3% of patients in the placebo group. 70.6% and 42.1% of \npatients in the luspatercept and placebo groups, respectively, met the \nsecondary endpoint of a mean absolute increase in platelet  count  of ≥30 x \n109/L.311 In the overall population, 4.6% and 7.9% of patients in the \nluspatercept and placebo groups, respectively, had treatment -emergent \ngrade 3 or 4 neutropenia.  \nIn a phase II multicenter, open- label, dose- finding study (PACE -MDS), \npatients with low - or intermediate- 1 risk MDS or non -proliferative CMML \nwho had anemia with or without RBC transfusion support were treated \nwith luspatercept ( n = 58).312 Of importance, 78% of the treated patients \nhad RS ≥15%, which was a positive predictor of response. Some patients \nwere enrolled in a dose -escalation cohort (n = 27) receiving luspatercept \nonce every 21 days at doses rangi ng from 0.125  to 1.75 mg/kg over a \nmaximum of 12 weeks. O ther patients  enrolled in the dose- expansion \ncohort (n = 31) received luspatercept doses ranging from 1.0  to 1.75 \nmg/kg , and patients could be treated for up to 5 years.312 Thirty -two of 51 \npatients (63%) who received higher doses of luspatercept (0.75– 1.75 \nmg/kg) achieved hematologic  improvement -erythroid, defined as : hemoglobin concentration increase of ≥ 1.5 g/dL from baseline for at least \n14 days in patients with low transfusion burden, and a reduction in RBC \ntransfusion of ≥4 RBC  units or ≥50% reduction in RBC  units over 8 \nweeks versus pre -treatment transfusion burden in patients with high \ntransfusion burden.312  \nLong-term efficacy and safety data of the PACE -MDS study  support the \nuse of lusptercept .313 Of the 108 patients who received treatment with \nluspatercept, 44 patients had non -ring sideroblastic disease and 48  had \nreceived prior treatment with ESAs. The hematologic improvement in \nerythroid response was 54% in the overall group and 36% in patients with \nnon-ring sideroblastic MDS. Among 73 evaluable patients, 44% of the \noverall group achieved RBC -TI ≥8 weeks, compared to 35% of the \nsubgroup with non- ring sideroblastic MDS. The most common \ntreatment -emergent adverse occurrences were  headache, bone pain and \nhypertension  in patients with non- ring sideroblastic MDS .  \nIn a phase II trial comprising 57 patients with lower -risk MDS that had \nrelapsed or was refractory to ESAs and who were RBC transfusion \ndependent, treatment with imetelstat, a telomerase inhibitor, resulted in a \n37% and 23% RBC TI rate, at 8 and 24 weeks respectively.314 At the same \ntime points, RBC TI rates of 42% and 29% respectively were  observed in \na subgroup of 38 patients without del(5q) and who were not previously \ntreated with an HMA or lenalidomide. The median duration for TI was 65 \nweeks for the overall group compared to 86 weeks in the subgroup. \nHematologic improvement , in terms of erythroid  response per the IWG \n2006 response criteria, was achieved in 65% of patients in the overall \ngroup and 68% of patients in the subgroup. Overall, the most common \ngrade ≥3 hemat ologic adverse events were neutropenia (60%), \nthrombocytopenia (54%), and anemia (19%) .

Out of those who achieved the primary endpoint, the \nmedian RBC -TI duration was 51.6 weeks with imetelstat and 13.3 weeks \nwith placebo. Hematologic improvement -erythroid was observed in 64% of \npatients in the imetelstat arm (vs. 52% in the placebo arm) when assessed \nby the IWG 2006 response criteria. When assessed by the IWG 2018 \ncriteria, hematologic improvement -erythroid was 42% in the imetelstat arm \nand 13% in the placebo arm. The results of a subgroup analysis showed that among patients with sEPO >500 mU/mL, 26.9% (vs. 9.1% for \nplacebo; P = .107) and 15.4% (vs. 0.0% for placebo; P  = .050) achieved TI \nwith imetelstat at 8 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. Ninety -one percent  \nof patients treated with imetelstat experienced grade 3– 4 treatment \nemergent adverse event s (TEAEs) , compared to 47% of patients receiving \nplacebo, with neutropenia (68% vs. 3% in the placebo arm) and \nthrombocytopenia (62% vs. 8% in the placebo arm) being reported as the \nmost frequent events.  \nLow-Intensity Therapy \nLow-intensity therapy includes the use of low -intensity chemotherapy or \nbiologic response modifiers. Although this type of treatment is mainly \nprovided in the outpatient setting, supportive care or occasional \nhospitalization (eg, for treatment of infections) may be needed.  Hypomethylating Agents  \nThe DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DMTI) HMAs  AzaC and decitabine \n(5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine)  have been shown in randomized phase III trials to \ndecrease the risk of leukemic transformation and, in a portion of patients, \nto improve survival.316- 319 In a phase III trial that compared AzaC with \nsupportive care in patients from all IPSS risk groups (N  = 191; previously \nuntreated in 83%), hematologic responses occurred in 60% of patients in \nthe AzaC arm (7% CR, 16% partial response [PR], and 37% hematol ogic \nimprovement) compared with a 5% hematologic improvement (and no \nresponses) in patients receiving supportive care.319 The median time to \nAML progression or death was significantly prolonged in the AzaC arm \ncompared with patients receiving supportive care (21 vs. 13 months; \nP = .007). Further improvement was seen in patients who received AzaC \nearlier in the course of disease, suggesting that the drug prolonged the duration of stable disease. Subsequently, Silverman and colleagues\n320 \nprovided a summary of three AzaC  studies in a total of 306 patients with \nhigh- risk MDS.320 In this analysis, which included patients receiving either \nSC or intravenous (IV) delivery of the drug , complete remissions were \nseen in 10% to 17% of patients treated with AzaC and partial remissions \nwere rare; hematologic improvement was seen in 23% to 36% of these patients. Ninety percent of the responses occurred prior to cycle 6 with a \nmedian number of cycles to first response of 3 .\n320 The authors concluded \nthat AzaC provided important clinical benefits for patients with high- risk \nMDS. Results from a phase III randomized trial in patients (N  = 358) with \nhigher -risk MDS (IPSS int -1, 5%; int -2, 41%; high risk, 47%) demonstrated \nthat AzaC was superior to conventional  care (ie, standard chemotherapy \nor supportive care) regarding OS.316 AzaC was associated with a \nsignificantly longer median survival compared with conventional care (24.5 \nvs. 15 months; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43– 0.77; P = .0001), thus providing \nsupport for the use of this agent in patients with higher -risk disease.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-30 AzaC therapy is a recommended option for progressive MDS or relatively \nhigh- risk disease. This drug has been approved by the FDA for the \ntreatment of patients with MDS and is generally administered at a dose of \n75 mg/m2/day SC for 7 days every 28 days for at least six  courses. \nTreatment courses may need to be extended further or may be used as a \nbridging therapy to more definitive therapy (eg, patients whose marrow \nblast counts require lowering prior to HCT). Although the optimal duration \nof therapy with Az aC has not been defined, some data suggest that \ncontinuation of AzaC beyond first response may improve remission quality. In a secondary analysis of the phase III randomized AZA -001 trial, \ncontinued AzaC therapy resulted in further improvement in response category in 48% of all responders.\n321 Although most patients with \nresponding disease achieved a first response by 6 cycles of therapy, up to \n12 cycles were required for the majority of responders to attain a best \nresponse.321 In this study, the median number of cycles from first response \nto best response was 3 to 3.5 cycles, and patients with responding disease received a median of 8 additional cycles (range, 0– 27 cycles) \nbeyond first response.\n321 \nAn alternative 5- day schedule of AzaC has been evaluated, both as an SC \nregimen (including the 5- 2-2 schedule: 75 mg/m2/day SC for 5 days \nfollowed by 2 days of no treatment, then 75 mg/m2/day for 2 days, every \n28 days; and the 5- day schedule: 75 mg/m2/day SC for 5 days every 28 \ndays)322 and as an IV regimen (75 mg/m2/day IV for 5 days every 28 \ndays).323 Although response rates with the 5 -day regimens appeared \nsimilar to the approved 7 -day dosing schedule,322,323 survival benefit with \nAzaC has only been demonstrated using the 7 -day schedule.  \nDecitabine, given IV and administered with a regimen that required hospitalization of patients, has also shown encouraging results for the \ntherapy of patients with higher -risk MDS. As the treatment regimen was \ngenerally associated with low -intensity –type t oxicities, it is also considered to be a “low -intensity therapy.” In earlier phase II studies, approximately \n30% of patients experienced cytogenetic conversion,\n324 with an overall \nresponse rate of 49%, and a 64% response rate was seen in patients with \na high- risk IPSS score325; results were similar to those seen in AzaC \nstudies.317,326 \nA phase III randomized trial of decitabine (15 mg/m2 IV infusion over 3 \nhours every 8 hours [ie, 45 mg/m2/day] on 3 consecutive days every 6 \nweeks for up to 10 cycles) compared with supportive care in adult patients \n(N = 170) with primary and secondary MDS (IPSS int-1, 30.5%; int -2, \n43.5%; high risk, 26%) indicated higher response rates, remission durations, times to AML progression, and survival benefits in the int -2 and \nhigh- risk groups.\n317 Overall response rate (CR + PR) with decitabine was \n17% (median duration, 10 months), with an additional 13% of patients \nshowing hematologic improvement. The probability of progression to AML \nor death was 1.68 -fold greater for patients receiving supportive care than \nfor patients receiving decitabine. Based on this study and three supportive \nphase II trials,327 the drug has also been approved by the FDA for treating \npatients with MDS.  \nIn another phase III randomized trial with this regimen, decitabine was \ncompared with best supportive care (BSC) in patients ≥60 years of age  \n(N = 233; median age, 70 years; range, 60– 90 years) with higher -risk \nMDS (IPSS int -1, 7%; int -2, 55%; high risk, 38%) not eligible for intensive \ntherapy.318 Median PFS was significantly improved in patients receiving \ndecitabine compared with supportive care (6.6 vs. 3 months; HR, 0.68; \n95% CI, 0.52– 0.88; P = .004), and the risk of AML progression at 1 year \nwas reduced with decitabine (22% vs. 33%; P  = .036). However, no \nsignificant differences were observed between decitabine and supportive \ncare for the primary endpoint of OS (10 vs. 8.5 months, respectively) or for \nmedian AML -free survival (8.8 vs. 6.1 months, respectively).318 In the \ndecitabine arm, a CR and PR were observed in 13% and 6% of patients, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

Decitabine was associated with \nsignificant improvements in patient -reported QOL  measures (as assessed \nby the European Organi zation for Research and Treatment of Cancer \n[EORTC]  QOL Questionnaire C30) for the dimensions of fatigue and \nphysical functioning.318 \nIn 2007, Kantarjian and colleagues328 provided an update to their study of \n115 patients with higher -risk MDS using alternative and lower -dose \ndecitabine treatment regimens.328 Patients received one of three  different \nschedules of decitabine, including both SC and IV administration with a \nmean of seven courses  of therapy. Responses were improved with the \nlonger duration of therapy. Overall, 80 patients (70%) responded with 40 patients achieving a CR and 40 achieving a PR. The median remission \nduration was 20 months with a median survival time of 22 months. The \nthree different schedules of decitabine were compared in another \nrandomized study of 95 patients with MDS or CMML, receiving 20 \nmg/m\n2/day IV for 5 days; 20 mg/m2/day SC for 5 days; or 10 mg/m2/day IV \nfor 10 days.329 The 5- day IV schedule was considered the optimal \nschedule. The CR rate in this arm was 39%, compared with 21% in the \n5-day SC arm and 24% in the 10- day IV arm ( P < .05). Alternate dosing \nregimens using lower doses of decitabine administered in an outpatient \nsetting are currently being evaluated.  \nA phase I dose -escalation study evaluated the combination of decitabine \nwith cedazuridine in 44 patients with intermediate to high- risk MDS or \nCMML.330 The clinical responses were comparable to those obtained with \na 5-day treatment with IV  decitabine.  These results were confirmed in a \nphase II study documenting bioequivalence for this combination in patients \nwith IPSS int -1 and above with 60% of patients achieving a clinical \nresponse and 21% of patients having a complete response.331 Results from the phase III ASCERTAIN randomized trial with a cross over design \nshowed that the combination treatment had an equivalent decitabine \nexposure to IV  decitabine.332 A clinical response was obtained in 70 % of \nevaluable patients. Occurring in 61%, 57%, and 50% of patients, \nrespectively, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia were the most \ncommon ≥3 adverse events.  \nSeveral retrospective studies have evaluated the role of cytoreductive therapy with HMAs  prior to allogeneic HCT (with both myeloablative and \nreduced- intensity conditioning [RIC] regimens).\n333- 336 These studies \nsuggest that HMAs  may provide a feasible alternative to induction \nchemotherapy regimens prior to transplant, and may serve as a beneficial  \nbridge to allogeneic HCT. The VidazaAllo study, which enrolled patients \nwith higher -risk MDS aged 55 to 70 years, reported a higher event -free \nsurvival rate in patients who underwent transplant following a reduced -\nintensity conditioning regimen after pretreatment with AzaC , compared to \nthose who received continuous AzaC  therapy.337 One meta -analysis found \nthat the use of HMAs  before HCT did not improve OS compared to \nchemotherapy, except in older patients.338 However, these agents should \nnot be used in lieu of early transplantation or to delay transplantation until loss of response or disease progression.\n339 \nAzaC and decitabine are considered to be therapeutically similar, although the improved survival of patients with higher -risk MDS  treated with AzaC \ncompared to control in a phase III trial, as indicated above, supports the preferred use of AzaC as a first -line treatment option for patients with high-\nrisk MDS who are not transplant candidates  until more trial data are \navailable. A lack of CR, PR or hematologic improvement, or frank \nprogression to AML (in particular with loss of control [proliferation] of peripheral counts or excess toxicity that precludes continuation of therapy) \nmay be indicative of disease that fails to  respond to HMAs .

As discussed earlier, the optimal \nduration of therapy with HMAs  has not been well -defined and no \nconsensus exists. The NCCN Guidelines Panel generally feels that \ntreatment should be continued if there is ongoing response and if there are \nno toxicities. Modifications should be made to the dosing frequency for \nindividual patients in the event of toxicity.  \nAs data have predominantly indicated altered natural history and \ndecreased evol ution to AML in patients who respond to DMTI HMAs , the \nmajor candidates  for these drugs are 1) patients with IPSS int -2– or \nhigh-risk disease ; or 2) IPSS -R intermediate- , high -, or very -high- risk \ndisease with any of the following criteria:  \n• Patients who are not candidates for high -intensity therapy;  \n• Patients who are potential candidates for allogeneic HCT but for whom \ndelay in receipt of that procedure is anticipated (eg, due to need to \nfurther reduce the blast count, improve patient performance status, or \nidentify a donor). In these circumstances, the drugs may be used as a \nbridging therapy for that procedure; or  \n• Patients with disease that is  not expected to respond to (or with disease \nrelapse after) ESAs or IST.  \nBiologic Response Modifiers and Immunosuppressive Therapy  \nThe currently available non- chemotherapy, low -intensity agents (biologic \nresponse modifiers) include: ATG, cyclosporine, and lenalidomide, all of \nwhich have shown some efficacy in phase II and phase III trials.4,340 -345  \nUse of IST with ATG, with or without cyclosporine,343,345  has been shown in \nseveral studies to be most efficacious in patients with MDS with \nHLA-DR15 histocompatibility type, marrow hypoplasia, normal \ncytogenetics, low -risk disease, and evidence of a PNH clone.161,346 \nResearchers from the National Institutes of Health ( NIH) have updated \ntheir analysis of 129 patients treated with IST with equine ATG alone, cyclosporine alone, or in combination.163 This study demonstrated \nmarkedly improved response rates in the subgroup of patients aged ≤60 \nyears with IPSS int -1 risk or patients with high response probability \ncharacteristics as indicated by their prior criteria (ie, age, number of \ntransfusions, possibly HLA -DR15 status).163 \nAlthough equine ATG has been found to be more effective than rabbit \nATG for treating AA,347 only limited data within the setting of MDS are \navailable regarding the comparative effectiveness of the two ATG formulations. In a relatively small phase II study in patients with MDS \n(N = 35; primarily RA subtype), both equine and rabbit ATG were shown to \nbe feasible and active.\n348 Some institutions have used tacrolimus in place \nof cyclosporine A based on the limited data that showed similar efficacy \nwith lower incidence of adverse events in children with AA.349,350 \nA phase I –II trial examined the combination of IST with eltrombopag in \npatients with aplastic anemia  (not MDS) .351 Three cohorts were used that \ndiffered by the schedule for the start of treatment and the duration of \ntreatment. The most common grade 3 or above adverse event attributed \nto eltrombopag was an abnormality in a liver test (18%) , specifically \ntransaminase elevation and/or hyperbilirubinemia.  The complete \nhematologic response and overall response rate ( ORR ) for the combined \ncohorts  at 6 months , when compared to a historical cohort of 102 \npatients who were treated with IST, were 39% (95% CI, 29 %–49%) \nversus  10% and 87% (95% CI, 80 %–94%) versus  66%, respectively. The \nrate of clonal evolution was not increased  in patients who received \neltrombopag compared to a historical cohort at the 2 -year time point. A \nphase II trial with patients with aplastic anemia reported an ORR of 76% in patients receiving the combination treatment compared to 71% in \npatients treated with IST only.\n352 The complete remission rate, median \ntime to response, and the survival rate at 2 years were similar in both \ngroups.

The most common \ngrade 3 or 4 adverse events included myelosuppression (neutropenia, \n55%; thrombocytopenia, 44%), which often required treatment interruption \nor dose reduction. Thus, careful monitoring of blood counts during the \ntreatment period is mandatory when using this agent, particularly in \npatients with renal dysfunction (due to the drug’s renal route of excretion). \nLenalidomide has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of TD \nanemia in patients with IPSS low/int -1–risk MDS with del(5q) with or \nwithout additional cytogenetic abnormalities.  \n A phase III randomized controlled trial compared the activity of \nlenalidomide (5 mg/d ay for 28 days or 10 mg/day  for 21 days every 28 days) versus placebo in patients with RBC -TD (N = 205) lower -risk MDS \n(IPSS low - and int -1 risks) and del(5q).\n355 The primary endpoint of \nRBC- TI ≥26 weeks was achieved in a significantly greater proportion of \npatients treated with lenalidomide (5 or 10 mg) versus placebo (37% vs. \n57% vs. 2%, respectively; P ≤ .0001 for both lenalidomide groups vs. \nplacebo). Among patients achieving RBC -TI with lenalidomide, onset of \nerythroid response was rapid, with a median time of 4.2 weeks and 4.3 \nweeks in the 5 -mg and 10 -mg lenalidomide groups, respectively.355 \nCytogenetic response rates were significantly higher for the lenalidomide \n5-mg (23%; P = .0299) and 10 -mg (57%; P < .0001) groups compared \nwith placebo (0%); CR rates were observed in 12% and 35% of patients in the lenalidomide 5- mg and 10 -mg arms, respectively. The estimated \n2-year cumulative risk to AML progression was 17% (95% CI, 8.7 –33.3), \n12.6% (95% CI, 5.4 –27.7), and 16.7% (95% CI, 8.3– 32.0) in the \nlenalidomide 5 -mg, 10 -mg, and placebo groups, respectively. This \nincreased to 35% (95% CI, 21.4– 54.6),  31% (95% CI, 18.1– 48.8), and \n43.3% (95% CI, 27.6– 63.1), respectively, at the estimated 4 -year mark. \nThe median OS among the lenalidomide 5 -mg, 10 -mg, and placebo \ngroups (3.5 vs. 4.0 vs. 2.9 years, respectively) was not statistically significantly different; however, median survival was significantly longer \nin patients who achieved RBC -TI (5.7 years; 95% CI, 3.2 –no response) \ncompared to non -responders (2.7 years; 95% CI, 2.0– 4.7).

Lenalidomide was not a significant factor for AML progression \nin either univariate or multivariate analyses. The 2 -year OS probabilities \nwere 90% with lenalidomide and 74% in the untreated cohort; the \ncorresponding 5- year OS probabilities were 54% and 40.5%, respectively, \nwith a median OS of 5.2 years and 3.8 years ( P = .755).356 Based on \nmultivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard models with left \ntruncation, lenalidomide was associated with a significantly decreased risk \nof death compared with no treatment (HR, 0.597; 95% CI, 0.399– 0.894; \nP = .012). Other independent factors associated with a decreased risk of \ndeath were female sex, higher hemoglobin levels, and higher platelet \ncounts. Conversely, independent factors associated with increased risk of \ndeath included older age and greater RBC transfusion burden.356 \nA phase II study evaluated lenalidomide treatment in patients with RBC-\nTD (N = 214) low - or int -1–risk MDS without del(5q).357 Results showed \nthat 26% of the patients with non-del(5q) (56 of 214) achieved TI after a \nmedian of 4.8 weeks of treatment. TI continued for a median duration of \n41 weeks. The median rise in hemoglobin was 3.2 g/dL (range, 1.0– 9.8 \ng/dL) for those achieving TI. A 50% or greater reduction in transfusion \nrequirement was noted in an additional 37 patients (17%), yielding an \noverall rate of hematologic improvement of 43%. The most common grade \n3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia ( 30%) and thrombocytopenia \n(25%).  An international phase III study of 239 patients with IPSS low - or int -1–risk \nMDS and RBC -TD and lacking the del(5q) abnormality evaluated the role \nof lenalidomide treatment.340 Patients receiving lenalidomide (n = 160) \ncompared to placebo (n = 79) had a higher rate of RBC -TI (26.9% vs. \n2.5%; P < .001) that lasted a median duration of 31 weeks (95% CI, 20.7 –\n59.1 weeks). TI persisting > 8 weeks was seen in 27% of patients receiving \nlenalidomide versus 2.5% of patients in the placebo cohort ( P < .001). \nOverall, 90% of patients had disease that responded to therapy within 16 weeks. Transfusion reduction of four or more units of packed RBCs was \nseen in 22% of lenalidomide- treated patients while no reduction was seen \nin the placebo group. Incidence of treatment -related mortality was 2.5% in \nboth groups; however, the incidence of myelosuppression was higher in the lenalidomide- treated group. In comparing the patients receiving \nlenalidomide versus placebo, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia \nwas 6 1.9% versus 12.7%, respectively, and the rate of thrombocytopenia \nwas 35.6% versus 3.8%, respectively.\n340 Further evaluation in more \nextended clinical trials is needed to determine the efficacy of this drug and \nother agents for patients with non-del(5q) MDS, particularly addressing the \ncharacterization of the subgroup of patients with MDS who responded to lenalidomide. The NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends lenalidomide be \nconsidered for patients with symptomatically anemic non- del(5q) MDS with \nanemia that did not respond to prior  therapy.  \nA phase III randomized trial in patients with lower -risk, ESA- refractory, \nnon-del(5q) MDS compared lenalidomide alone (10 mg/day  for 21 days \nevery 28 days) with patients receiving lenalidomide in conjunction with \nepoetin alfa (60,000 U/wk).\n358 Erythroid response after 4 treatment cycles \nwas 23.1% (95% CI, 13.5– 35.2) versus 39.4% (95% CI, 27.6– 52.2; \nP = .044), respectively. Overall RBC -TI was not statistically different \nbetween groups (13.8% vs. 24.2%; P = .13).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-35 significant improvement was seen with the addition of epoetin alfa (47% \nvs. 16%; P  = .04), suggesting that lenalidomide may restore sensitivity of \nMDS erythroid precursors to Epo.358 Another phase III trial also reported a \nsignificantly higher major erythroid response in patients  with lower -risk \nMDS lacking del(5q)  treated with 4  cycles of lenalidomide in conjunction \nwith epoetin alfa compared to lenalidomide monotherapy (28.3% vs. \n11.5% ; P = .004).359 The median duration of the major erythroid response \nfor the combinat ion treatment was 23.8 months versus  13.0 months for the \nlenalidomide arm.  \nHigh -Intensity Therapy  \nHigh-intensity therapy includes intensive induction chemotherapy or \nHCT.4,360 Although these approaches have the potential to change the \nnatural history of the disease, there is an attendant greater risk of \nregimen- related morbidity and mortality. The Panel recommends that such \ntreatments be given in the context of clinical trials. Comparative studies \nhave not shown benefit between the different intensive chemotherapy \nregimens (including idarubicin- , cytarabine -, fludarabine- , and \ntopotecan -based regimens) in MDS.361 \nA high degree of multi -drug resistance occurs in marrow hematopoietic \nprecursors from patients with advanced MDS362 and is associated with \ndecreased responses and shorter response durations in patients treated with many of the standard chemotherapy induction regimens. Thus, \nchemotherapeutic agents used to treat “resistant -type” AML, and agents \nthat modulate this resist ance, are now being evaluated for the treatment of \npatients with advanced MDS. Ongoing clinical trials evaluating multi -drug \nresistance modulators are important, as both positive\n363,364 and negative365 \nstudies have been published.  \nAllogeneic HCT from an HLA -matched sibling, unrelated donor , \nhaploidentical donor, or cord blood donor is a preferred approach for treating select patients with MDS, particularly those with high- risk \ndisease.366- 376 This includes both standard and RIC strategies.  \nA multicenter study investigat ing the outcomes of  patients with IPSS i nt-2 \nor high MDS who were eligible for RIC allo-transplant found a survival \nadvantage for patients who underwent transplantation.377 At 3 years, an \nintention- to-treat analysis revealed that the adjusted OS rate in patients \naged 50 to 75 years was 47.9% (95% CI, 41.3% –54.1%) and 26.6% (95% \nCI, 18.4% –35.6%; P = .0001) for those in the donor arm (expected to \nundergo reduced- intensity conditioning HCT, n = 260) and the no- donor \narm (expected to receive HMA therapy or best supportive care, n = 124), respectively. In addition, at the same time point, the leukemia- free survival \nrate was 35.8% (95% CI, 29.8% –41.8%) versus  20.6% (95% CI, 13.3% –\n29.1%; P = .003) , respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that there \nwere no differences in outcomes by age ≤65 years  versus age >65 years . \nHowever, since ~34% of patients in both arms had disease that did not \nrespond to HMAs , it is not surprising that the donor arm results appeared \nbetter.   \nAnother study  examined retrospectively the outcomes of patients with \nhigh- risk MDS or secondary AML who underwent transplantation without \nprior cytoreductive therapy  (n = 67)  compared to those who received \ncytoreductive therapy in the form of induction chemotherapy (n = 64) or \nHMAs (n = 34) prior to transplant ation.378 Patients had a blast count of \n≥5% in the bone marrow.  Reduced- intensity conditioning was applied \nbefore stem cell infusion in 68% of patients. Compared to the other groups, a higher percentage of patients in the HMA group (85%) were \ntreated with a reduced- intensity conditioning regimen, which is likely due \nto the difference in age. Multivariate analyses revealed that the type of \npretransplant treatment did not impact the OS, relapse- free survival ( RFS), \nand non- relapse mortality. However, cytogenetics, reduced- intensity \nconditioning and the use of an unrelated donor were found to be predictors PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

At 5 years, there was no difference in OS (61%, \n50%, and 45% respectively; P  = .116) and relapse- free survival (38%, \n41%, and 38% respectively; P  = .926) between the 3 groups. The OS ( P = \n.971) and RFS ( P = .883) were similar in patients with blasts < 10% or with \nblasts ≥10% in the bone marrow who underwent transplantation without \nprior cytoreductive therapy.  \nA randomized trial in  patients with MDS or AML determined that \nmyeloablative conditioning resulted in a higher rate of transplanted- related \nmortality at 4 years (25.1% vs. 9.9% for reduced -intensity conditioning; P  \n< .001).379 However, as the risk of relapse is greater in those who received \nreduced- intensity conditioning (HR, 4.06; P  < .001), patients in the \nmyeloablative conditioning arm fared better in terms of OS (HR, 1.54; P  = \n.03). \nEarly referral for transplant evaluation is recommended to allow moving to \ntransplant efficiently. Pre -transplant debulking therapy to reduce marrow  \nblasts to < 5% blasts  with the goal of reducing post -transplant relapse is \nrecommended, although the optimum strategy has not been determined. \nTo reduce the disease burden pre- transplant is particularly important in \npatients who will receive a reduced -intensity conditioning regimen.339 At \nsome centers, failure to achieve <5% blasts with cytoreduction did not \npreclude from proceeding to transplant, as these patients appeared to derive survival benefit from transplant.\n377,378  \nAn argument in favor of pre- transplant cytoreduction was provided by \nFestuccia et al339 who showed that the presence of minimal identifiable \ndisease (MID) prior to transplantation in patients with MDS or AML arising \nfrom MDS impacted prognosis following transplantation. In patients with \nMID positive by cytogenetics, irrespective of positivit y by flow cytometry, \nthe overall mortality risk was higher in those who underwent low -intensity \nconditioning compared to those who underwent high- intensity conditioning. \nHowever, in patients with MID negative status, as determined by both cytogenetics and flow cytometry, the risk of mortality with low - and high -\nintensity conditioning regimens was similar. It is important to note that this \nstudy did not specifically examine outcomes in patients who proceeded  to \ntransplant without cytoreductive therapy. In patients with a MID positive \nstatus, as assessed by both cytogenetics and flow cytometry, the risk of \nrelapse was higher in those who underwent low -intensity conditioning, as \nopposed to those who underwent high -intensity conditioning. As the MID \nclassificati on can help to identify patient subgroups who may have better \noutcomes with high-  or low -intensity conditioning, the authors propose to \nconsider the presence of MID to help determine the intensity of the \nconditioning regimen for patients being considered f or transplant.  \nFor higher -risk MDS, AzaC, decitabine, oral  decitabine and cedazuridine, \nor other therapies may be used as a bridge to transplantation. These \nagents should not be used to delay HCT in patients who have available \ndonors. A clinical trial followed by allo -HCT is another option. In patients \nwith disease relapse after a prolonged remission following the first \ntransplant, a second transplant or donor lymphocyte infusion immun o-\nbased therapy may be considered. Allogeneic HCT may also be \nconsidered in select patie nts with lower -risk MDS (IPSS int -1, IPSS- R, and \nWPSS intermediate) with severe cytopenias. Whether transplants should \nbe performed before or after patients achieve remission following induction \nchemotherapy has not been prospectively established.380 Comparative \nclinical trials are needed to address these issues.  \nTargeted Therapy  \nSome e merging data have shown efficacy of novel agents, including \nvenetoclax in combination with HMA with or without ivosidenib to target \nmIDH1  in patients with myeloid malignancies including higher -risk \nMDS .381,382 When used as cytoreduction for MDS in combination with an \nHMA, venetoclax has been effectively given for 14 days in monthly \ncourses.381 Repeating the bone marrow evaluation after 1 to 2 cycles is PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

Phase I results from a study investigating the combination of \nvenetoclax with AzaC in patients with high- risk MDS or chronic \nmyelomonocytic leukemia revealed an ORR of 82% in the HMA -naïve \ncohort and 100% in patients with relapsed/refractory disease follow ing \nHMA treatment.384 Neutropenia (39%), thrombocytopenia (39%), lung \ninfection (30%), and febrile neutropenia (17%) were the most frequent \ngrade 3– 4 TEAEs.  In another study, treatment with venetoclax in \ncombination with AzaC  in patients with relapsed/refractory MDS , results \nshowed a modified ORR of 39% and a median OS of 12.6 months .385 \nFebrile neutropenia (34%), thrombocytopenia (32%), neutropenia (27%), \nand anemia (18%) were the most frequent grade ≥3 hematologic adverse \nevents.  \nMutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) or 2 ( IDH2 ) genes \noccur in approximately 4% to 12% of patients with MDS .386- 388 Substudy \ndata from a phase I trial investigating the safety and efficacy of ivosidenib \nin 18 evaluable patients with relapsed or refractory MDS with m IDH \ndemonstrated an ORR of 83.3%  and an approximate median OS of 36 months .389 Additionally, 71.4% and 75.0% of patients with RBC -TD and \nplatelet transfusion- dependence, respectively, achieved transfusion \nindependence. Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were fatigue and hyponatremia \n(5.3% each). Emerging data have also shown the utility of olutasidenib for \ntreatment patients with IDH1  mutations.390 In one study, 33% of patients \nwith intermediate -, high- , or very high- risk MDS treated with olutasidenib \nmonotherapy achieved an overall response, while 69% of patients treated \nwith olutasidenib and AzaC  achieved an overall response.  Cytopenias \nwere the most commonly reported grade 3/4 TEAEs.  While not studied in \nMDS, the combination of ivosidenib and AzaC  has shown clinical benefit \nin patients with newly diagnosed mutant IDH1  (mIDH1 ) AML who were \nineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy.391 In a phase III trial, \ntreatment with ivosidenib plus AzaC resulted in improved event -free \nsurvival (HR, 0.33; P = .002) and median OS (24.0 vs. 7.9 months; HR, \n0.44; P = .001), compared to treatment with placebo plus AzaC. Ongoing \nclinical trials are investigating the efficacy of targeted IDH1/2  inhibitors in \npatients with MDS (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03503409, NCT03471260, and NCT03744390).\n382,392,393 \nA phase II study in  patients with higher -risk IDH-2 mutated MDS \ndetermined an ORR and median OS  of 74% and 26 months , respectively, \nin newly diagnosed patients treated with enasidenib and AzaC , compared \nto 35% and 20 months , respectively, in patients who were previously \ntreated with an HMA .394 Across both groups, the most frequent adverse \nevents included neutropenia (40%), nausea (36%), and constipation \n(32%).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-38 Recommended Treatment Approaches  \nTherapy for Lower -Risk Disease (IPSS Low, Intermediate -1; IPSS -R \nVery Low, Low, Intermediate; or WPSS Very Low, Low, \nIntermediate)  \nRegarding the therapeutic options for patients with lower -risk MDS  with \nclinically significant cytopenias, the NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends \nstratifying these patients into several groups . For patients without \nsymptomatic anemia who have clinically relevant thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, recommended treatment options include a clinical trial, AzaC, \ndecitabine, oral decitabine and cedazuridine, or IST, with or without \neltrombopag (useful in certain circumstances) for select patients. IST is \nrecommended for patients generally aged ≤60 years and with ≤5% \nmarrow blasts, or those with hypocellular marrows, PNH clone positivity, \nor STAT -3 mutant cytotoxic T- cell clones. IST includes equine ATG, with \nor without cyclosporin A. Additionally, for severe thrombocytopenia, \neltrombopag alone could be considered. Some studies have shown \nclinical benefit with low doses of AzaC or decitabine.395 If there is disease \nprogression , no response following initial treatment,  or relapse,  \nreevaluation with bone marrow and/or molecular testing is recommended. \nAdditionally,  HMAs should be considered, if not previously used.  \nIvosidenib or olutasidenib are recommended for patients with m IDH1  MDS  \n(category 2B).  Eltrombopag or romiplostim can be considered for patients \nwith severe or refractory  thrombocytopenia.258,396,397 Subsequent treatment \noptions include ivosidenib or olutasidenib (category 2B) for m IDH1  MDS if \nan IDH1 inhibitor was not previously used. In the absence of m IDH1 , a \nclinical trial as well as consideration of allogeneic HCT in select patients \nwith lower -risk MDS (IPSS int -1, IPSS- R intermediate , and WPSS \nintermediate MDS) with severe cytopenias are recommended.  \nFor patients with del(5q) chromosomal abnormalities alone or with one \nother cytogenetic abnormality, except those involving chromosome 7, and \nsymptomatic anemia , lenalidomide is a category 1 preferred option if sEPO is >500 mU/mL . If sEPO is ≤ 500 mU/mL, lenalidomide is a preferred \nregimen and epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are other recommended \nregimens. An FDA -approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any  \nrecommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines . Studies \nhave shown the relative safety of lenalidomide in these patients and \nimproved QOL outcomes in randomized clinical trials.398,399 The \nrecommended initial dose of lenalidomide in this setting is 10 mg/day  for \n21 days, every 28 days, or 28 days monthly; response should be \nassessed 2 to 4 months after initiation of treatment. In patients with a \nclinically significant decrease in neutrophil or platelet counts, caution is \nrequired and may warrant either use of  a modified dose of lenalidomide.  In \nthe previously discussed phase III trial with lenalidomide in patients with del(5q), patients with low neutrophil counts (<500 cells/mcL) or plat elet \ncounts (<25,000 cells/mcL) were excluded from the study.\n355 Patients with \nmonosomy 7 are an exception and should be treated in the higher \nprognostic risk category. Exposure to lenalidomide has been associated \nwith an elevated risk of TP53 -mutated clones.400 Additional consideration \nfor and/or closer monitoring of particular patients is warranted . If no \nresponse is seen to lenalidomide or ESAs , or in cases of relapse  \n(recurrence of symptomatic anemia or transfusion requirements) , \npatients with del(5q) chromosomal abnormalities alone or with one other \ncytogenetic abnormality, except those involving chromosome 7, and \nsymptomatic anemia  should follow treatment options (with the exception of \nimetelstat) for patients without the del(5q) abnormality , with RS <15% (or \nRS <5% with an SF3B1  mutation) and with sEPO levels >500 mU/mL . \n(see Management of Lower -Risk Disease  in the algorithm) . Generally, \nreevaluation with bone marrow and/or molecular testing is recommended if \nthere is no response, intolerance, or relapse.  \nPatients without the del(5q) abnormality,  alone or with other cytogenetic \nabnormalit ies and with symptomatic anemia, are categorized based on  RS \npercentage and sEPO levels.

Epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa may \nbe considered if sEPO ≤200 mU/mL.401 The starting dose of \nluspatercept -aamt is 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, which may be increased to \n1.33 mg/kg every 3 weeks if RBC transfusions are still needed after at \nleast 2 consecutive doses (6 weeks) at the 1 mg/kg starting dose. The \ndose may be further incr eased to 1.75 mg/kg every 3 weeks if RBC \ntransfusions are still needed after at least 2 consecutive doses (6 weeks) at the 1.33 mg/kg dose. The initial dosing of imetelstat is 7.1 mg/kg IV \nmonthly with potential dose decrements since frequent transient thrombocytopenia and neutropenia may occur. The starting platelet and \nneutrophil levels should be ≥75,000 and ≥1500, respectively.\n315 If there is \nno response by 3 to 6 months of treatment with luspatercept -aamt  or \nrelapse,  and the sEPO level is ≤500 mU/mL, imetelstat (category 1, \npreferred ), as well as epoetin alfa with or without G -CSF (other \nrecommended)  or darbepoetin alfa with or without G -CSF (other \nrecommended) , are recommended options. If there is no response by 3 \nto 6 months of treatment with luspatercept -aamt or relapse, and the \nsEPO level is >500 mU/mL, or if there is no response to first -line \ntreatment with imetelstat or relapse, imetelstat (if not previously used), luspatercept -aamt  (category 1) (if not previously used) are preferred \ntreatment options.  Consideration of lenalidomide is another \nrecommended option.  \nThe epoetin alfa dose required is 40,000 to 60,000 SC units 1 to 2 times \nper week. Darbepoetin alfa should be given subcutaneously at a dose of \n150 to 300 mcg every other week. For a lack of response, the dose may \nbe escalated. At some NCCN member institutions, darbepoeti n alfa has \nbeen given at doses up to 500 mcg every other week. Erythroid responses \ngenerally occur within 6 to 8 weeks of treatment.\n298,402- 404 A prompter response may be obtained with a higher starting dose. The above -\nrecommended dose for epoetin alfa is much higher than the dose needed \nto treat renal causes of anemia wherein marrow responsiveness would be relatively normal. However, if a response occurs at the higher dose, the \nrecommendation is to attempt a decrease to the lowest effective dose. \nEvidence suggests that G -CSF (and, to a lesser extent, GM -CSF) has \nsynergistic erythropoietic activity when used in combination and markedly enhances the erythroid response rates due to enhanced survival of red \ncell precursors.\n298,402,403,405 This is particularly evident for patients with RS \n≥15% in the marrow (and sE PO level ≤500 mU/mL), as the very low \nresponse rates to epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alone in this subgroup are \nmarkedly enhanced when combined with G -CSF.298,403 For the erythroid \nsynergistic effect, relatively low doses of G -CSF are needed to help \nnormalize the neutrophil count in patients who initially have neutropenia or \nto double the neutrophil count in patients who do not initially have \nneutropenia. For this purpose, an average of 1 to 2 mcg/kg SC G -CSF is \nadministered either daily or 1 to 2 times per week.298,402,403,405 \nIf there is no response after 6 to 8 weeks of treatment with ESAs (with or \nwithout G -CSF) or after 3 to 6 months of imetelstat , luspatercept -aamt  or \nlenalidomide,  or if relapse occurs,  clinical trial or one of the following are \nrecommended : AzaC (preferred), ivosidenib if mIDH1  (other \nrecommended),  olutasidenib if m IDH1  (category 2B, other recommended),  \ndecitabine (other recommended), imetelstat if not previously used (other \nrecommended), oral decitabine and cedazuridine (other recommended), \nconsideration of lenalidomide (useful in certain circumstances) , or ATG \nwith cyclosporin A with or without eltrombopag (ATG may be omitted when \nclinically indicated).

A clinical trial or consideration of HCT for select patients are \nrecommended for patients without m IDH1 . \nEpoetin alfa,  darbepoetin alfa or luspatercept -aamt  are preferred options \nfor patients with no del(5q), with or without other cytogenetic \nabnormalities, with RS  <15% (or RS <5% with an SF3B1  mutation) and \nsEPO ≤500 mU/mL. Patients with normal cytogenetics, RS <15%, and \nsEPO levels of ≤500 mU/mL may respond to Epo if relatively high doses \nare administered.246,405,406 Iron repletion needs to be verified before \ninstituting epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa therapy. If no response occurs \nafter 6  to 8 weeks  with ESAs alone (despite adequate iron stores) , or after \n3 to 6 months with luspatercept -aamt, or if relapse occurs , treatment with \nimetelstat (category 1, preferred), luspatercept if not previously used (preferred),  epoetin alfa with or without G -CSF or lenalidomide (other \nrecommended)  or darbepoetin alfa with or without G -CSF or lenalidomide \n(other recommended) are rec ommended  \nIf no response occurs following subsequent treatment with ESAs, with or \nwithout lenalidomide or G -CSF, within 6 to 8 weeks of treatment, or \nfollowing subsequent treatment with imetelstat or luspatercept -aamt  within \n3 to 6 months of treatment,  or if relapse occurs,  treatment should be \ndiscontinued. Patients should follow treatment options for patients without \nthe del(5q) abnormality, with sEPO > 500 mU/mL, and with poor probability \nto respond to IST (see Management of Lower -Risk Disease  in the \nalgorithm). Imetelstat (category 1, preferred), if not previously used, \nivosidenib if mIDH1  (useful in certain circumstances), and olutasidenib if  \nmIDH1  (category 2B, useful in certain circumstances)  are also options . A \nvalidated decision model has been developed for predicting erythroid \nresponses to Epo plus G -CSF based on the patient’s basal sE PO level and number of previous RBC transfusions.\n403,407 This cytokine treatment is \nnot suggested for patients with endogenous sE PO levels >500 mU/mL \ndue to the very low erythroid response rate to these drugs in this patient \npopulation.   \nPatients with symptomatic anemia with no del(5q), with or without other \ncytogenetic abnormalities, with RS <15% (or RS <5% with an SF3B1  \nmutation) and sE PO levels >500 mU/mL should be evaluated to determine \nwhether they would be good candidates for IST (generally ≤60 years and \nwith ≤5% marrow blasts, or with hypocellular marrows, P NH clone \npositivity, or STAT3 -mutant cytotoxic T- cell clones) . For patients with \ndisease that has a good probability to respond to IST, ATG plus \ncyclosporin A, with or without eltrombopag, is recommended. ATG may be \nomitted when clinically indicated. If there is no response within 3 to 6 \nmonths, intolerance, or relaps e, or if the patients have disease that has a \npoor probability to respond to IST, a clinical trial, treatment with AzaC (preferred), decitabine (other recommended), imetelstat if not previously \nused (other recommended), oral decitabine and cedazuridine (other \nrecommended), or consideration of lenalidomide (useful in certain \ncircumstances), are recommended. Oral decitabine and cedazuridine \ncould be a substitution for IV decitabine in patients with IPSS \nIntermediate -1 and above.\n332 A phase II prospective study of patients with \nMDS, that is IPSS low or int -1, with symptomatic anemia with disease that \nwas not expected to respond or that failed to respond to Epo, showed that \n5-day AzaC courses were well -tolerated.408 Although neutropenia and \nthrombocytopenia were adverse events (47% and 19% of patients, \nrespectively), these toxicities were transient. Other non -hematologic \ntoxicities were mild. AzaC treatment was effective in 60% of patients in the study.  In addition,  3-day cycles of HMAs have also been beneficial for \npatients  with lower -risk MDS with anemia .\n395 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-41 If there is no response within 6 cycles of AzaC  or 4 cycles of decitabine \nor oral decitabine and cedaz uridine , no response to imetelstat or \nlenalidomide, or in cases of intolerance or relapse, ivosidenib or \nolutasidenib (category 2B) are recommended for m IDH1  MDS if an IDH1 \ninhibitor was not previously used.  A clinical trial or consideration of HCT \nfor select patients are recommended  for patients without m IDH1 . \nEmerging data are demonstrating effectiveness of enasidenib for patients with MDS with IDH2  mutations\n409 (see Targeted Therapy ). \nWhile these guidelines provide a framework in which to treat patients with \nMDS, careful monitoring for disease progression and consideration of the \npatient’s preferences remain major factors in the decision and timing of the \ntreatment regimen initiated.  \nTherapy for Higher -Risk Disease (IPSS Intermediate -2, High; IPSS -R \nIntermediate, High, Very High; or WPSS High, Very High)  \nHMA therapy is the standard of care for patients with higher -risk MDS , \npreferably as a bridge to HCT in eligible patients . Treatment  for higher -risk \ndisease is dependent on whether patients  are possible candidates for \nintensive therapy (eg, allogeneic HCT, intensive chemotherapy). Clinical \nfeatures relevant for this determination include patient age  (including \npatients up to 75 years of age ), performance status, absence of major \ncomorbid conditions, psychosocial status, patient preference,  and \navailability of a suitable donor and caregiver. Patients may be taken immediately to transplant or bridging therapy can be used to decrease \nmarrow blasts to an acceptable level prior to transplant.\n377 The patient’s \npersonal preference for type of therapy needs particular consideration. \nRegardless, supportive care should be provided for all patients.  Intensive Therapy  \nAllogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  \nAllogeneic HCT is recommended for eligible patients. Treatment with \nAzaC with ivosidenib (if m IDH1 ) (category 2B), AzaC with olutasidenib (if \nmIDH1 ) (category 2B), or enrollment in a clinical trial prior to allogeneic \nHCT; HMAs (AzaC, decitabine, or oral decitabine and cedazuridine) with \nor without venetoclax; and high- intensity chemotherapy are also options. \nOral decitabine and cedazuridine could be a substitution for IV decitabine \nin patients with IPSS Intermediate -1 and above.332 The addition of \nvenetoclax is based on patient status and tolerance. Single -agent \nivosidenib, single- agent olutasidenib (category 2B), or AzaC  in \ncombination with olutasidenib (category 2B) followed by allo -HCT may \nbe considered for m IDH1  MDS if there is no response following \ntreatment with HMAs with or without venetoclax or high- intensity \nchemotherapy.  Allo-HCT is recommended if there is no response to \nHMAs with or without venetoclax or high -intensity chemotherapy and in \nthe absence of mIDH1 or following a response, although most centers \nrequire evidence of response to HMAs if blast counts are >10% prior to \nproceeding to allo -HCT. However, at so me centers, failure to achieve \n<5% blasts with cytoreduction should not preclude patients from \nproceeding to transplant, as these patients appeared to derive survival \nbenefit from transplant.377,378 For patients who are transplant candidates, \nan HLA -matched sibling or HLA -matched unrelated donor can be \nconsidered. Res ults with HLA -matched unrelated donors have improved to \nlevels comparable to those obtained with HLA -matched siblings. With the \nincreasing use of cord blood or HLA -haploidentical related donors, HCT \nhas become a viable option for many patients. High- dose conditioning is  \ntypically used for younger patients, whereas RIC for HCT is generally the strategy in older individuals.\n410 \nTo aid therapeutic decision- making regarding the timing and selection of \npatients with MDS for HCT, a study compared outcomes with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:49:34 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-42 HLA-matched sibling HCT in patients with MDS ≤60 years of age  to data \nin patients with MDS who did not undergo transplantation from the \nIMRAW/IPSS database.411 Using a Markov decision analysis, this \ninvestigation indicated that patients with IPSS int -2 and high- risk MDS  ≤60 \nyears of age  had the longest life expectancy if transplanted (from \nHLA-identical siblings) soon after diagnosis, whereas patients with IPSS \nlow risk MDS had the best outlook if HCT was delayed until MDS \nprogressed. For patients in the int -1–risk group, there was only a slight \ngain in life expectancy if HCT was delayed; therefore, decisions should be \nmade on an individual basis (eg, dependent on platelet or neutrophil \ncounts).411 A retrospective study evaluated the impact of the WHO \nclassification and WPSS on the outcome of patients who underwent allogeneic HCT.\n205 The data suggest that patients with lower -risk MDS  \n(based on WPSS risk score) do very well following allogeneic HCT, with a \n5-year OS of 80%. With increasing WPSS scores, the probability of 5 -year \nsurvival after HCT declined progressively to 65% (intermediate risk), 40% \n(high risk), and 15% (very high risk ).205 \nBased on data regarding RIC for transplantation from two studies412,413 and \ntwo comprehensive reviews of the field,414,415 patient age and disease \nstatus generally dictated the type of conditioning. Patients > 55 or 65 years  \nof age , particularly if they had <10% marrow myeloblasts, generally \nreceived RIC; if the blast count was high, pre- HCT debulking therapy was \noften given. Younger patients, regardless of marrow blast burden, most frequently received high- dose conditioning. Variations on these \napproaches would be considered by the individual transplant physician based on patient features and the specific regimen used at that center. \nSome general recommendations have been presented in a review article.\n416 \nThere are limited data regarding the use of allogeneic HCT in older adults with MDS; however, studies suggest that age alone should not be an exclusionary factor for eligibility. In a prospective allogeneic transplant trial \nusing nonmyeloablative conditioning, 372 patients between ages 60 and \n75 years with hematologic malignancies (AML, MDS, chronic lymphocytic \nleukemia, lymphoma, and multiple m yeloma) were shown to have no \nassociation between age and non -relapse mortality, OS, and PFS.\n417 The \nstudy supports the use of comorbidities and disease status, rather than \nage alone, as criteria for determining the eligibility of patients for \nallogeneic HCT.  \nOther retrospective studies have also evaluated transplant -related \nmortality in older patients with MDS receiving RIC for allogeneic \ntransplant.418,419 No increase in mortality was seen in either study. In a \nretrospective analysis of 514 patients with de novo MDS (aged 60– 70 \nyears), RIC allogeneic transplants were not associated with improved life \nexpectancy for patients with low or int -1 IPSS MDS compar ed to other \nnon-transplant therapies. However, a potential improvement in life \nexpectancy was seen in patients with int -2– or high -risk IPSS MDS.420 It is \nrecognized that there are even fewer data available in regard to patients \nwho are >75 years of age.  \nIntensive Chemotherapy  \nFor patients eligible for intensive therapy but lacking a donor \nhematopoietic cell source, or for patients in whom the marrow blast count \nrequires reduction, consideration should be given to the use of intensive \ninduction chemotherapy.421 Although the response rate and durability are \nlower than for standard AML, this treatment (particularly in clinical trials with novel agents) could be beneficial in some patients. For patients with a \npotential hematopoietic cell donor who require reduction of tumor burden \n(ie, to decrease the marrow blast count), achievement of even a partial \nremission may be sufficient to permit the HCT.

In patients with \ndisease relapse after a prolonged remission following the first transplant or \nwith no response, a second transplant or donor lymphocyte infusion \nimmuno- based therapy may be consi dered. Enrollment in a clinical trial or \nHMAs (AzaC, decitabine, oral decitabine and cedazuridine) are also options. If there is no response to treatment or the disease relapses, \nenrollm ent in a clinical trial or supportive care is recommended.  \nNon-Intensive Therapy \nFor patients with higher -risk MDS who are not candidates for intensive \ntherapy  or allogeneic HCT , the use of AzaC (category 1) with or without \nvenetoclax, decitabine with or without venetoclax, oral decitabine and \ncedazuridine with or without venetoclax, ivosidenib (category 2B) with or \nwithout AzaC  (if mIDH1 ) (category 2B), or olutasidenib with AzaC  (if \nmIDH1 ) (category 2B) are recommended. AzaC  with or without \nvenetoclax is a preferred regimen while the others are listed as other \nrecommended regimens. Oral decitabine and cedazuridine could be a \nsubstitution for IV decitabine in patients with IPSS Intermediate- 1 and \nabove.332 Enrollment in a clinical trial is also an option for these patients. \nThe addition of venetoclax is based on patient status and tolerance. If \nthere is no response, intolerance, or relapse, reevaluation with bone \nmarrow and/or molecular testing is recommende d. Ivosidenib or \nolutasidenib (category 2B), if an m IDH1  inhibitor was not previously \nused, is recommended for m IDH1  MDS  if there is no response within 6 \ncycles of AzaC  or 4 cycles of decitabine or oral decitabine and \ncedazuridine,  intolerance , or relapse. Enrollment in a clinical trial is \nrecommended if there is no response or relapse following treatment with \nivosidenib or olutasidenib within 3 to 6 months or for those without \nmIDH1 . In a phase III, international, multicenter, controlled, open -label study  \n(AZA- 001), 358 patients with higher -risk MDS  were randomly assigned \n1:1 to receive AzaC  (75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days every 28 days) or \nconventional care (best supportive care, low -dose cytarabine, or \nintensive chemotherapy.316 With a median follow -up of 21.1 months \n(interquartile range [ IQR], 15.1–26.9), treatment with AzaC  led to a \nhigher median OS (24.5 months [ 9.9 months –not reached] ) when \ncompared to conventional care (15.0 months [ 5.6–24.1 months ]; HR, \n0.58; 95% CI , 0.43–0.77; P = .0001). At 2 years, 50.8% (95% CI , 42.1% –\n58.8%) of patients receiving AzaC  were alive compared with 26.2% \n(18.7% –34.3%) of patients receiving conventional care group ( P < \n.0001). The most frequent grade 3– 4 adverse events for all treatments  \nwere peripheral cytopenias . These data demonstrated that  treatment \nwith AzaC  increased OS in patients with higher -risk MDS  relative to \nconventional care.  \nResults from a phase III trial comparing decitabine to BSC in patients with \nhigher -risk disease who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy \ndemonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS and reduced \nAML transformation; improvements in OS and AML- free survivals were \nalso seen, al though they did not reach statistical significance.317 AzaC , \ndecitabine, or oral decitabine and cedazuridine should be continued for a \nleast 6 cycles of AzaC or 4  cycles of decitabine or oral decitabine and \ncedazuridine to assess response to these agents. For patients who show \nclinical benefit, treatment with HMAs should be continued as maintenance \ntherapy.  \nTwo further  reports from the phase III, international, multicenter, \nrandomized AZA -001 trial have evaluated AzaC compared to conventional \ncare regimens (CCR) in patients with higher -risk MDS.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes   \n \nMS-44 or BSC.422,423 The OS was increased with AzaC treatment compared to \nCCR (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 –0.77; P < .001), and a greater number of \npatients achieved hematologic improvement (49% vs. 29%; P  < .0001).422 \nThe earlier report from the same trial showed improved OS and tolerability \nin patients aged ≥75 years with good performance status.423 It should be \nnoted that, to date, no head- to-head trials have compared AzaC with \ndecitabine. Therefore, the P anel preferentially recommends AzaC \n(category 1) versus decitabine or oral decitabine and cedazuridine based on data from the  phase III trial that showed superior median survival with \nAzaC compared to BSC.  \nSupportive Care Only  \nFor patients with adverse clinical features or disease progression despite therapy and the absence of reasonable specific anti -tumor therapy, \nadequate supportive care should be maintained.  \nSummary  \nThe NCCN Guidelines are based on extensive evaluation of the reviewed risk-based data and indicate current approaches for with the management \nof MDS. Drugs approved by the FDA for treating specific patients with  \nMDS include lenalidomide for patients with del(5q) cytogenetic \nabnormalities; AzaC , decitabine, or the oral combination of decitabine and \ncedazuridine for treating higher -risk MDS or MDS that is non-responsive; \ndeferasirox and deferoxamine for iron chelation in the treatment of iron \noverload; luspatercept -aamt  for treating MDS  with RS in those with no \nresponse to prior ESA treatment or for treating lower -risk MDS ; imetelstat \nfor treating lower -risk MDS in patients with no response or loss of \nresponse to ES As for those who are ineligible for ESAs; and ivosidenib for \nrelapsed or refractory mIDH1 MDS . However, as a substantial proportion \nof subsets of patients with MDS  lack or lose effective treatment for their \ncytopenias or for altering the natural history of the disease, clinical trials \nwith these and other novel therapeutic agents, along with supportive care, are critical for disease management . Additionally, supportive care \nmeasures should be offered to these patients, including relevant \ntransfusions, antibiotics, and psychosocial support as well as QOL considerations.  Evaluating the role of thrombopoietic cytokines for the \nmanagement of thrombocytopenia in MDS and determining the  effects of \ntherapeutic interventions on QOL are important issues needing \ninvestigation.\n402,404,407,424,425 Progress toward improving the management of \nMDS has occurred over the past few years and more advances are anticipated with these guidelines providing a framework for coordination of \ncomparative clinical trials.
