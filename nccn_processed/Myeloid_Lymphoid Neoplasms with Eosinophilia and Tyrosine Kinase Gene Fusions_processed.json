V ariant presentations include blast phase MPN, AML with eosinophilia, \nor rarely T-cell ALL (T-ALL) with FIP1L1::PDGFRA or myeloid sarcoma. This entity has a strong male predominance and is commonly associated with \nelevated serum tryptase and splenomegaly. Peripheral eosinophilia is usually, but not always, observed. BM is hypercellular with increased eosinophil \nprecursors (generally without dysplasia) and proliferation of loosely distributed CD25+ spindle-shaped mast cells. Dense clusters of mast cells typically \nseen in SM with the KIT D816V mutation are usually absent (See  NCCN Guidelines for Systemic Mastocytosis ). \nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia and PDGFRB Rearrangement :\nClinical presentations associated with this entity are: CMML, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), MDS/MPN-unclassifiable, MPN, juvenile \nmyelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), and blast phase disease involving the BM and/or extramedullary disease (EMD) involving myeloid, lymphoid, or mixed \nphenotype acute leukemias. This entity also has a strong male predominance. Eosinophilia is not always  present.\nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia and FGFR1 Rearrangement :\nClinical presentations associated with this entity are: MPN with eosinophilia, AML, B-cell, T-cell lymphoma/ALL, or mixed phenotype acute leukemia,  \nand/or EMD of myeloid/lymphoid, or mixed phenotype acute leukemias. This entity has a moderate male predominance and is generally associated \nwith an aggressive clinical course with rapid progression of chronic phase disease to blast phase/secondary acute leukemia.

ALL or de novo AML have also been observed. This entity has a strong male predominance and is generally associated with an aggressive \nclinical course with rapid progression of chronic phase disease to blast phase/secondary acute leukemia. The presence of eosinophilia is more variable \nfor BCR::JAK2 and ETV6::JAK2 variants.\nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia and  FLT3 or ABL1 Rearrangement : \nMyeloid and/or lymphoid neoplasm with eosinophilia (MLNE), consistent with the WHO category of CEL, not otherwise specified (CEL, NOS) is the \ncharacteristic clinical presentation associated with  FLT3 rearrangement. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) have \nalso been described. De novo ALL is the most common clinical presentation associated with  ABL1 rearrangement; however, various acute leukemia and \nchronic myeloid/lymphoid phenotypes have also been described. It is generally associated with an aggressive clinical course, disease progression, or \nrelapse. Eosinophilia is not always  present. \nMLNE that Present as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia6: \nFor MLNE that initially present as B-cell ALL (B-ALL) or T-ALL, the TK gene fusion should involve the myeloid lineage in addition to lymphoblasts. In such \ninstances, the chronic myeloid neoplasm in MLNE may manifest either prior to or concomitantly or may emerge after therapy for the ALL. Genes fusions \ntypically associated with BCR::ABL1–like B-ALL are specifically excluded from this category (eg, EBF1::PDGFRB and ATF7IP::PDGFRB  fusions). JAK2 \nfusions with certain partner genes, such as t(5;9)(q14.1; p24.1)/ STRN3::JAK2, and PAX5::JAK2 are usually seen in BCR::ABL1-like B-ALL, which are, by \ndefinition, not MLNE. ETV6::JAK2 is a genetic variant of PCM1::JAK2; however, more than half of the reported cases of ETV6::JAK2 are de novo B-ALL \nor de novo T-ALL. Similarly, FLT3-rearranged cases also can present as de novo B-ALL and T-ALL without myeloid lineage involvement, and these cases \nshould be classified as BCR::ABL1-like B-ALL or de novo  T-ALL. \nReferences\n1 Reiter A, Gotlib J.

EMD represents a blast phase \ncomponent. Blast phase may also present as an EMD with an \"MPN-like\" picture in blood and marrow. \n• There is no current definition for \"accelerated phase\" disease; similar to myeloid neoplasms such as CML, 10%–19% blasts in the BM or PB \nhave been used to define \"accelerated phase.\" \n• EMD may present as extramedullary myeloid sarcoma, T-cell or B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, or myeloid/T-cell or B-cell lymphoid mixed \nphenotype acute leukemias. EMD may present alone, or with chronic or blast phase disease involving the BM or PB. Lineage involvement of \nthe EMD may be different from the lineage involving the BM or PB.\n• The clinical presentation of these diseases partly reflects the fusion partner gene for the TK.

TK Gene Fusions in Myeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia (MLNE-B, 3 of 5) and Table 2. Diagnostic Assays for the Detection of \nTK Gene Fusions in Myeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms (MLNE-B, 4 of 5)\nPDGFRA-Rearranged Eosinophilia: \nThe FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement is found in approximately 10% of patients with idiopathic eosinophilia.1-4 Elevated serum tryptase level and/or mast cell \nproliferation in the BM are surrogate markers for FIP1L1 ::PDGFRA rearrangement (these patients are KIT D816V-negative and do not satisfy WHO criteria for \nSM). PB or BM FISH have similar sensitivities and the diagnosis can be made from either source. Decalcified BM should not be used as this results in a yellow \nautofluorescence in cells that precludes FISH interpretation.\nFIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement results from an approximately 800-kb submicroscopic deletion in chromosome 4q12 leading to the fusion of FIP1L1 and PDGFRA \ngenes. Metaphase karyotype is unrevealing and the diagnosis is made by FISH and/or RT-PCR. The FISH probe used to identify these rearrangements detects \nloss of the intervening material, such as the gene CHIC2.5,6 An alternative approach is a nested RT-PCR or RT-qPCR assay. Although the breakpoints in PDGFRA \noccur exclusively in exon 12, the breakpoints in FIP1L1 are more variable but still amenable to detection by RT-qPCR. The sensitivity of this assay in most labs \nis 0.01%–0.001%, but as the fusion can be difficult to detect in some patients a combination strategy of FISH and RT-PCR is the most sensitive method for the \ndetection of this rearrangement, particularly in patients where clinical suspicion is high (eg, male, elevation of serum tryptase) and for detecting minimal residual \ndisease (MRD). Although not widely available, chromosome genomic array testing (CGAT; also known as CMA), single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A), or \narray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) can readily detect submicroscopic deletions at diagnosis when a clone size is at least 20%. \nOther rarer partner gene fusions for PDGFRA have been described (eg, BCR, ETV6, KIF5B, CDK5RAP2, STRN, TNKS2, FOXP1).2,7 Detection of these alternate \nPDGFRA rearrangements is critical due to the excellent prognosis these patients have when they are treated with imatinib. Conventional cytogenetics will detect \nthese rearrangements, but these other rearrangements can be best detected by FISH with the break-apart PDGFRA FISH probe. The break-apart FISH can detect \na rearrangement with any gene partner and is more sensitive than karyotype analysis. RT-PCR for specific gene rearrangements is also informative, if available.8\nA multiplexed approach using NGS to detect gene fusions is now being increasingly adopted by clinical diagnostic laboratories and may be used for both diagnosis \nof and monitoring for MRD.  \nLastly, focused sequencing of exons 9–19 can detect mutations. Activating point mutations in PDGFRA have been identified in patients with FIP1L1 ::PDGFRA–\nnegative HES and some are implicated in disease pathogenesis and may be imatinib responsive.9\nPDGFRB-Rearranged Eosinophilia:\nThe ETV6::PDGFRB [t(5;12)(q31~33;p13.2)] is the most common abnormality with a hematologic presentation similar to CMML.4,6,7,10 The breakpoints in PDGFRB \nare located in the chromosomal region 5q31~q33. In addition to ETV6, more than 30 different partner gene fusions for PDGFRB rearrangements have been \ndescribed. Rare cases with normal karyotype have been demonstrated to harbor PDGFRB rearrangements (eg, TNIP1-PDGFRB in MPN with eosinophilia).\nContinued\nReferences on MLNE-B (5 of 5)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:50:36 PM.

Eosinophilia without PDGFRB \nrearrangement is resistant to imatinib therapy.  \nConventional cytogenetic analysis is the most cost-effective approach to confirm the diagnosis due to the large number of partner genes; \nhowever, it may miss subtle or cryptic translocations.  Confirmation of PDGFRB rearrangement by FISH is indicated in all patients with 5q31~33 breakpoint. FISH \nbreak-apart probes will demonstrate all PDGFRB gene rearrangements with higher sensitivity and can be important in confirming the diagnosis and in treatment \nmonitoring, but they will not identify the specific translocation partner . A dual-fusion probe can be used to confirm the partner if a specific one is suspected.3,6\nSensitive RT-PCR has the benefit of small clone detection, in addition to the ability to detect complex and/or cryptic cases not evident by conventional \ncytogenetics. However, outside of ETV6::PDGFRB, the feasibility of RT-PCR is limited by the large number of partner genes.\nA multiplexed approach using NGS to detect gene fusions is now being increasingly adopted by clinical diagnostic laboratories and may be used for both \ndiagnosis of and monitoring for MRD.\nFGFR1-Rearranged Eosinophilia :\nTo date, 16 partner genes with FGFR1 have been described.4,6,7 The most common rearrangement is t(8;13) (p11;q12), which results in the fusion of  \nZMYM2 with FGFR1 in about 50% of cases. This entity is associated with a high incidence of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia. Two other common \nrearrangements include t(8;9)(p11;q33) (~15%) and t(6;8)(q27;p11) (~10%), which result in the fusions of CNTRL and FGFR1OP with FGFR1, respectively.\nConventional cytogenetics will identify  FGFR1-associated translocations, which can be confirmed by FISH using  FGFR1 break-apart probes .\nJAK2 -Rearranged Eosinophilia :\nTo date, translocations involving  PCM1::JAK2 t(8;9)(p22;p24),  ETV6::JAK2 [t(9;12)(p24;p13)], and  BCR::JAK2 [t(9;22)(p24;q11)] have been described.\nConventional cytogenetics can identify these translocations, but they should be confirmed by  JAK2 break-apart probes.4,6,7\nFLT3- or ABL1-Rearranged Eosinophilia : \nETV6::FLT3 [t(12;13)(p13;q12)] is the gene fusion involved in the majority of cases with  FLT3 rearrangement.7 Other variants with SPTBN1::FLT3,  \nGOLGB1::FLT3, and TRIP11::FLT3 gene fusions have also been reported.7 Conventional cytogenetics to identify t(12;13) followed by confirmatory FISH with \nbreak-apart probes or nested RT-PCR can be used to confirm the presence of  an ETV6::FLT3 gene fusion.7\nETV6::ABL1 [t(9;12)(q34;p13)] is the gene fusion involved in the majority of cases with  ABL1 rearrangement.7 Other complex rearrangements have also been \nreported. Routine karyotyping can be inconclusive and FISH can miss small insertions. A multiplexed approach using NGS to detect gene fusions is now being \nincreasingly adopted by clinical diagnostic laboratories and may be used for both diagnosis of and monitoring for MRD. FISH with ETV6 and ABL1 probes, RT-\nPCR, or RNA sequencing are more reliable for the identification of ETV6::ABL1 rearrangement.7,11\nReferences on MLNE-B (5 of 5)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:50:36 PM.

Mutations described include TET2, ASXL1, EZH2, or SETBP1 and, recently, activating STAT5 N642H mutations.6\n• A recent survey of 61 patients with WHO-defined myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and harboring PDGFRA, \nPDGFRB, FGFR1,  or PCM1::JAK2  identified that 14 patients (23%) had at least one mutation.7 The mutations detected were ASXL1, BCOR, \nDNMT3A, TET2, RUNX1, ETV6, NRAS, STAT5B, and ZRSR2. Multiple mutations were identified in 3 patients, and RUNX1  was found to be \nrecurrently mutated (6 of 19 mutations detected) and was detected in 5 of 6 patients with FGFR1 rearrangements (83%). For the other groups, \nthe mutation rates were 14% for PDGFRA, 23% for PDGFRB, and 14% for PCM1::JAK2 . \n• NGS, RNA fusion panel, and/or comparative genomic hybridization can be used to identify novel gene fusion or gene fusion events that \nmay not be detectable with other methods  when clinical suspicion  is high and FISH for PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, JAK2 , ABL1, or FLT3 \nare negative. As these diagnostics are not broadly available, it is recommended that these cases be discussed with a hematopathologist. \nCurrently the impact on outcomes of additional mutations detected by NGS is unclear. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of \nmutations on disease course.\n• For NGS studies, the pathogenicity of the variant(s) and relevance to eosinophilia need to be determined, including whether specific variants \ncould be clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) mutations.\nReferences\n1 Pardanani A, Lasho T, Barraco D, et al.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia  and  \nTyrosine  Kinase Gene Fusions  \nMS-2 Overview \nEosinophilic disorders and related syndromes represent a heterogeneous \ngroup of neoplastic and non- neoplastic conditions , characterized by an \nincreased number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood,  and may involve \neosinophil -induced organ damage .1-3  \nHypereosinophilia (HE) is  defined as persistent elevated eosinophil  count \n>1.5 x  109/L in blood and/or tis sue and is divided into four  variant types  \nper an international consensus proposal : hereditary (familial) , HE FA; \nprimary (clonal/neoplastic) , HE N; secondary (reactive) , HE R; and HE of \nundetermined significance,  HE US.4 Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is \nthe term applied for any of these HE variant s with evidence of \neosinophil -induced tissue/organ damage . The term idiopathic HES should \nbe applied when HE with associated organ damage is detected with no \napparent underlying disease or syndrome.4 The international consensus \ncriteria, as well as the definition and classification of HE, HES , and other \nconditions accompanied by HE are outlined in  Table 1 and Table 2.  \nHE N is characterized by  neoplastic proliferation of eosinophils  and can be \nassociated with any of the World Health Organization ( WHO )-defined \nmyeloid and/or lymphoid neoplasms .4 A number of dysregulated  tyrosine \nkinase (TK) gene fusions  have been implicated in the pathogenesis of \nmyeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia (MLNE ).5-7  \nIn 2008 , the WHO  classification of eosinophilic dis orders  was revised to \ninclude clonal /neoplastic  eosinophilia resulting from TK  gene fusions as a \nnew category termed,  “myeloid /lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and \nrearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB , or FGFR1 .”8 In the 2017 WHO \nclassification, myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm s with PCM1 ::JAK2 \nrearrangement was added as a provisional entity.9-11 In addition to these \naforementioned TK gene fusions , rearrangements involving  FLT3 and \nABL1  genes were  described in MLNE , but were not formally added to the WHO classification .6 In both the 2022 International Consensus \nClassification (ICC)12 and 2022 5th e dition of the WHO Classification,13 the \nmajor category name for these diseases has  changed to \n“myeloid /lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene \nfusions.” It now includes gene rearrangements including PDGFRA , \nPDGFRB , FGFR1 , JAK2 , FLT3 , and ETV6::ABL1 . The WHO 5th edition \nadditionally includes other defined fusions including ETV6::FGFR2; \nETV6::LYN ; ETV6::NTRK3 ; RANBP2::ALK; BCR::RET ; and \nFGFR1OP::RET .  \nMyeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs ) with peripheral blood eosinophilia \n(eosinophil count >1.5 x 109/L) that lack all of the aforementioned TK gene \nfusions  as well as BCR::ABL1 , and exhibit an abnormal bone marrow \nmorphology  and with evidence of clonality , are classified as c hronic \neosinophilic leukemia (CEL) in the absence of another WHO -defined \nmyeloid neoplasm .14 The presence of increased blasts (5% to <20%) can \nfurther support  the diagnosis of CEL. The 2022 ICC and WHO \nclassifications highlight the frequent dysplastic morphology observed in \ncases of CEL, although it is still included in the MPN (and not \nmyelodysplastic syndromes [MDS ]/MPN) category.12,13 \nThe identification of specific TK gene fusions and the emergence of \ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)  has significantly improved the diagnosis  \nand treatment of some patients with MLNE .15 The treatment  of patients \nwith MLN E requires a multidisciplinary team approach,  preferably in \nspecialized medical centers.  \nThe NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) \nfor Myeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia and Tyrosine Kinase \nGene Fusions  include recommendations for the diagnosis, staging , and \ntreatment of any one of the MLN E associated with a TK gene fusion \nincluded in the 2022 ICC and WHO 5th edition c lassification .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia  and  \nTyrosine  Kinase Gene Fusions  \nMS-3 Guidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org .  \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the development of  this version of the NCCN Guidelines® for \nMyeloid/ Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia and Tyrosine Kinase \nGene Fusions , an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain key literature published on myeloid/lymphoid \nneoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions  since the \nprevious Guidelines update using the following search terms:  eosinophilic  \ndisorders, and tyrosine kinase fusion gene rearrangements . The PubMed \ndatabase was chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for \nmedical literature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.16 \nThe search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial,  Phase II; Clinical Trial,  Phase III; Clinical Trial,  Phase IV; \nGuideline; Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; \nMeta -Analysis; Multicenter Study ; Systematic Reviews; and Validation \nStudies. The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from \nadditional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines as discussed by the P anel during the G uidelines update have been i ncluded in this \nversion of the discussion  section.  Recommendations for which high -level \nevidence is lacking are based on the P anel’s review of lower -level \nevidence and expert opinion.   \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.17 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to \nuse language that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -\nclassist, anti -misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight biased; and inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead \nfocusing on organ -specific recommendations. This language is both \nmore accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN \nGuidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female,  and male  \nwhen citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how \nsex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably \nor inconsistently. If sources do not diffe rentiate gender from sex \nassigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages \nresearchers to collect more specific data in future studies and \norganizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their future \nanalyses.  \nDiagnostic Criteria  \nThe diagnosis requires the presence of a TK gene fusion confirmed by \ncytogenetic and/or molecular  testing ( see Cytogenetic  and Molecular  \nTesting in thi s discussion  on MS -9).14  \nEosinophilia is frequently observed , but it is not a prerequisite for the \ndiagnosis  of these neoplasms . While prominent eosinophilia is present in \nmost patients with FIP1L1::PDGFRA , it is not always  present in patients \nwith a PDGFRB , FGFR1,  JAK2 , FLT3,  or ETV6::ABL1  rearrangement.5 \nPatients also present with other blood count abnormalities , and organ \ndamage may develop irrespective of the underlying TK gene fusion. See \nClinical Presentation in this discussion  on MS-5.  \nThe clinical phenotype of MLN E is driven by the TK (eg , PDGFRA , \nPDGFRB , FGFR1 , JAK2 , FLT3 , ABL1 ) as well as the partner gene. Many \nvariant fusion partner genes  (>70) have been characterized to date.5-7 See PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:50:36 PM.

TK Gene Fusions  in Myeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with \nEosinophilia in the algorithm.  \nMyeloid/ Lymphoid Neoplasms With Eosinophilia and \nFIP1L1 ::PDGFRA Rearrangement  \nThe diagnosis requires the presence of FIP1L ::PDGFRA gene fusion \n(resulting from an interstitial deletion of CHIC2  gene on chromosome \n4q12)  or a PDGFRA rearrangement with a variant gene fusion.14,18- 20 \nActivating PDGFRA  mutations can activate the protein, but are \nexceedingly uncommon. If appropriate molecular analysis is not avai lable, \nthis diagnosis should be suspected in the presence of  a Philadelphia (Ph) -\nnegative MPN with the hematologic features of CEL associated with \nsplenomegaly, elevation of serum tryptase, and an increased number of \nmast cells  and/or fibrosis in the bone marrow .5,7,21 MLN E with \nFIP1L1 ::PDGFRA  rearrangement has a very strong male predominance.  \nThe bone marrow is hypercellular with increased eosinophil precursors \n(generally without dysplasia) and proliferation of loosely distributed , \ninterstitial CD25+ spindle- shaped mast cells may be seen, whereas KIT \nD816V mutation and dense clusters of mast cells typically seen in \nsystemic mastocytosis ( SM) are usually absent  except in rare cases .21 \nCEL is the most common clinical presentation . Blast phase MPN, acute \nmyeloid leukemia (AML)  with eosinophilia , and  rarely T -cell acute \nlymphoblastic lymphoma (T -ALL) or myeloid sarcoma  have also been \ndescribed .5,22,23 Pediatric cases have also been reported .24-27  \nMyeloid/ Lymphoid Neoplasms With Eosinophilia and PDGFRB \nRearrangement  \nThe diagnosis requires the presence of t(5;12)q31~q33;p13) or a variant translocation resulting in an ETV6 ::PDGFRB gene  fusion or a PDGFRB  \nrearrangement with a variant gene fusion.\n14 Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical chronic myeloid \nleukemia (CML), MDS/MPN -unclassifiable, MPN, juvenile myelomonocytic \nleukemia (JMML),  and blast -phase  disease involving the bone marrow \nand/or extramedullary disease (EMD)  involving  myel oid, lymphoid, or \nmixed phenotype acute leukemias  are the clinical presentations  \nassociated with MLN E and PDGFRB rearrangement .5,28 This entity also \nhas a strong male predominance.  \nMyeloid/ Lymphoid Neoplasms With Eosinophilia and  FGFR1  \nRearrangement  \nThe diagnosis requires the presence of t(8;13)(p11;q12) or a variant \ntranslocation leading to FGFR1 rearrangement demonstrated in myeloid \ncells, lymphoblasts, or both.14,29,30 \nMLN E with FGFR1 rearrangement  has a moderate male preponderance,  \nand it is generally associated with an aggressive clinical course with rapid \nprogression of chronic phase disease to blast phase/secondary acute \nleukemia.5,31,32 \nMPN with eosinophilia  are the most common  myeloid neoplasms  \nassociated with FGFR1 -rearranged eosinophilia. FGFR1:: ZMYM2 gene \nfusion and t(8;13) are associated with high incidence of T- ALL.6 AML, \nB-cell, T-cell lymphoma/ acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL), or mixed \nphenotype acute leukemia (usually associated with peripheral blood or \nbone marrow eosinophilia) , and/or EMD of myeloid, lymphoid, or mixed \nphenotype acute leukemias  have also been described in some patients .5,33  \nMyeloid/ Lymphoid Neoplasms With Eosinophilia and  JAK2 \nRearrangement  \nThe diagnosis requires the presence of a JAK2  fusion gene, with PCM1  \nbeing the most frequent partner gene fusion.14  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:50:36 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia  and  \nTyrosine  Kinase Gene Fusions  \nMS-5 MLN E with JAK2  rearrangement  has a strong male preponderance and is \ngenerally associated with an aggressive clinical course with rapid \nprogression of chronic phase disease to blast phase/secondary acute \nleukemia.9,10   \nMPN or MDS/MPN with eosinophilia is the characteristic clinical presentation and ALL or de-novo AML has been described in some \npatients.\n9,10 The differential diagnosis of JAK2  and ABL1 fusions with a \nphenotype of ALL includes Ph- like ALL.  \nMyeloid/ Lymphoid Neoplasms With Eosinophilia and  FLT3  or ABL1 \nRearrangement  \nMLNE with FLT3 rearrangement and MLNE with ETV6::ABL1  fusion were \nadded as part of the WHO  classification for MLNE and TK gene fusions.13 \nThe diagnosis requires the presence of t(12;13)(p13;q12) leading to FLT3 \nrearrangement ( ETV6  is the most common partner gene in both cases) or \nt(9;12)(q34;p13) leading to ABL1 rearrangement .34 Rarely, other gene \nfusion partners of FLT3 have been described.6 \nMLN E with FLT3  or ABL1 rearrangement is generally associated with an \naggressive clinical course, disease progression,  or relapse. CEL , not \notherwise specified ( NOS ) is the characteristic clinical presentation in \nMLN E with FLT3  rearrangement . Peripheral T- cell lymphoma or T- ALL \nhave also been described.6 De novo ALL is the most common clinical \npresentation associated with ABL1  rearrangement in children; various \nacute leukemia and chronic myeloi d/lymphoid phenotypes have been \ndescribed in adults .35 The differential diagnosis of JAK2  and ABL1  fusions \nwith a phenotype of ALL includes Ph- like ALL .34 \nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms With Eosinophilia That Present as \nAcute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  \nFor MLNE that initially present as B -cell ALL (B-ALL) or T- ALL, the TK \ngene fusion should involve the myeloid lineage as well as lymphoblasts.36 In such instances, the chronic myeloid neoplasm in MLNE may manifest \neither prior to or concurrently or may emerge following therapy for ALL. \nGene fusions ( eg, EBF1::PDGFRB,  ATF7IP::PDGFRB ) that are typically \nassociated with BCR::ABL1 -like B -ALL are specifically excluded from this \ncategory. JAK2 fusions with certain partner genes, such as t(5;9)(q14.1; \np24.1)/ STRN3::JAK2  and PAX5::JAK2  are usually observed in \nBCR::ABL1 -like B -ALL, which are, by definition, not MLNE. ETV6::JAK2  is \na genetic variant of PCM1::JAK2 . However, more than half of the reported \ncases of ETV6::JAK2  are de novo B -ALL or de novo T- ALL. Similarly, \nFLT3- rearranged cases can also present as de novo B -ALL or T -ALL \nwithout myeloid lineage involvement, and these cases should be classified \nas BCR::ABL1 -like B -ALL or de novo T- ALL. \nClinical Presentation \nChronic phase disease may present in the bone marrow or peripheral \nblood, with o r without eosinophilia. B one marrow may exhibit an atypical \nmast cell proliferation, often in an interstitial pattern but not the typical \naggregates found in SM.21  \nThere is no current definition for accelerated phase disease; however, the \npresence of 10% to 19% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood has been used to define accelerated phase similar to myeloid neoplasms \nsuch as CML. Blast phase (≥20% blasts  in the bone marrow and/or \nperipheral blood) may  present as AML or ALL, or acute leukemias with \nmixed phenotype acute leukemias  and/or extramedullary myeloid \nsarcoma, T-ALL, or B-ALL. Blast phase may also present as an EMD with \nMPN -like features in the bone marrow or peripheral blood.  TK gene \nfusions  have been identified in a number of patients  where eosinophilia is \nconcurrently diagnosed with T- cell lymphomas or blast phase acute \nleukemias of myeloid,  lymphoid,  or mixed phenotype acute leukemias  (de \nnovo or secondary) .\n6   PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:50:36 PM.

EMD \nmay present alone or with chronic or blast phase disease involving the \nbone marrow or peripheral blood,  and l ineage may be different from the \nlineage involving the bone marrow /peripheral blood.  \nMLN E with TK gene fusions are associated  with a variety of symptoms \nrelated to the overproduction of cytokines, growth factors , and \neosinophil -derived mediators.2 The most common presenting signs and \nsymptoms include weakness and fatigue, cough, dyspnea, myalgias or \nangioedema, rash or fever , and rhinitis.7 In addition, patients also present \nwith various blood count abnormalities  depending on the underlying \nneoplasm (eg,  neutrophilia, basophilia, thrombocytosis, monocytosis, \nmyeloid immaturity, and  both mature and immature eosinophils with \nvarying degrees of dysplasia and anemia and/ or thrombocytopenia with or \nwithout increased blast cells or dysplasia).2,7 \nOrgan damage may occur in HES irrespective of the underlying subtype of HE due to the increased production and/or persistent accumulation of \neosinophils in tissue.\n2 The s kin, lungs, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, heart, \nand nervous system  are the most commonly involved organ systems , \nalthough all organ systems may be susceptible to eosinophilia.2,7 \nEndomyocardial thrombosis and fibrosis are often documented in primary \n(neoplastic)  HES variants  (HES N), particularly in association with the \nFIP1L1::PDGFRA  gene  fusion.2,7 Imaging studies and organ -directed \nbiopsy are useful for the documentation of target organ involvement.2 See \nEvaluation for Target Organ Involvement  in this discussion on  MS-9.  \nDiagnosis  \nAccurate diagnosis of the underlying cause of HE , taking into account the \nhistopathologic, clinical, laboratory , cytogenetic , and molecular criteria,  is \nessential to establish the appropriate treatment plan. It is important to r ule out HE R caused by the reactive expansion of eosinophils that can be \nassociated with a wide  range of non- neoplastic ( ie, allergies, infections, \nautoimmune or inflammatory disorders) or  neoplastic (hematologic or solid \nmalignancies) conditions.1,3 Differential diagnoses of the non- neoplastic \nconditions, immunodeficiency syndromes, solid tumors , and hematologic \nmalignancies should be considered in patients presenting with HE.  See \nCauses of Secondary (Reactive) Eosinophilia in the algorithm.   \nAllergic disorders (eg, allergic asthma, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, drug reactions) are the most common cause of HE\nR occurring in about 80% of \npatients , and parasi tic infections represen t the second most common \ncause.1,3 Strongyloidiasis due to Strongyloides stercoralis  exposure is \ngenerally the most common parasitic infection,  although infections due to \nseveral other organisms have also been reported.  If exposure to an \ninfectious  agent is suspected, initiation of appropriate treatment is \nnecessary  to prevent superinfection  and consultation with an infectious \nagent specialist is recommended.  \nHE may also be present in individuals with certain immunodeficiency \nsyndromes associated with abnormal immunoglobulin (Ig) levels (eg,  \nhyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome [formerly known as Job syndrome], Omenn syndrome , Wiskott -Aldrich syndrome)  and pulmonary eosinophilic \ndiseases (eg , allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [ABPA], eosinophilic \ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis [ EGPA]  [also known as Churg -Strauss \nsyndrome ]).\n1,3 HES may also be associated with a wide spectrum of \ndermat ologic conditions  (eg, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, eczema).3  \nHE R is frequently observed in patients with solid tumors and lymphoid \nmalignancies (eg , Hodgkin lymphoma, B -cell and T- cell lymphomas) due \nto the increased production of growth factors and eosinophilopoietic \ncytokines.3 In solid tumors, the incidence of HE is generally limited to \nadvanced- stage disease , and among the lymphoid malignancies, the \nincidence of HE is more frequent in T- cell lymphomas.3 In myeloid PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:50:36 PM.

In \nsome patients , the eosinophilia may be part of the abnormal clone; \nhowever, in some circumstances , it may  be secondary, related  to the \nelaboration of eosinophilopoietic cytokines from neoplastic cells . The term \n“myeloproliferative variant of HE” has been used to describe patients  with \nMPN features such as splenomegaly or an increased serum tryptase. \nWhile many of these patients  have  FIP1L1::PDGFRA –positive  disease, \nthe term has not been formally recognized by the WHO classification.7 \nLymphocyte- variant HES (L-HES)  is characterized by clonal T cells with \nan aberrant immunophenotype and is associated with an increased \nnumber of eosinophils , elevated serum thymus  and activation -related \nchemokine (TARC) , and IgE levels  (although these findings are neither \nsensitive nor specific) .3,7,21 It is considered  a mixture of a clonal disease \nwith immunophenotypically aberrant T  cells (eg, double- negative immature \nT-cells [CD3+ , CD4-, CD8-] or absence of CD3 [CD3 -, CD4+] or CD3+ , \nCD4+ , CD7-) and secondary ( reactive)  HE due to the elaboration of T \nhelper 2 cytokines, such as  interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL- 13 from the \nabnormal T -cell population. Approximately 10% to  20% of patients have \ndisease that  can evolve to various types of T -cell lymphoma  or Sézary \nsyndrome. Flow cytometry with T -cell immunophenotyping and molecular \nanalysis to confirm T -cell clonality may provide additional support to \nconfirm the diagnosis of L-HES.21 While there are no consensus \ndiagnostic criteria for L- HES, it is felt that a  clonal  TCR gene \nrearrangement alone is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of L -HES, as \nthis finding can be non- specific and can also be identified in patients with \nHES of undetermined significance or even patients with a PDGFRA \nrearrangement .37,38   \nA diagnosis of a HE N should be suspected in patients with elevated serum \ntryptase level, abnormal T- cell population, increased blasts, cytogenetic or \nmolecular abnormality, and/or bone marrow fibrosis , splenomegaly , and/or lymphadenopathy, after ruling out all possible  causes of HE R. Screening \nfor TK gene fusions  (PDGFRA , PDGFRB , FGFR1 , JAK2 , FLT3 , or ABL1 ) \nor other cytogenetic abnormality is recommended for patients with a \nsuspected HE N.  \nThe diagnosis of CEL should be considered in the absence of TK gene \nfusions, when there are  other cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities  \nand/or morphologic evidence of an eosinophilic myeloid neoplasm .14 The \npresence of increased blasts (5% to <20%) can further support  the \ndiagnosis of CEL. The major distinguishing characteristics between CEL \nand HES are the presentence of abnormal bone marrow morphology \nand/or the presence of molecular/cytogenetic abnormalities.14 Bone \nmarrow morphology  is incorporated into the diagnostic criteria for CEL.12  \nBone marrow morphologic abnormalities often include hypercellularity , \ndysplastic  megakaryocytes with variable dysplasia in other cell lineages, \nand bone marrow fibrosis accompanying an eosinophi l infiltrate . These \nfeatures are important to help distinguish CEL, NOS from idiopathic \nHES.39  In the WHO 5th edition, the qualifier “NOS” is removed from the \nname, but is retained in the ICC .12,13 \nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) studies have revealed that somatic \nmutations associated with a hematologic malignancy can be detected in \npeople with normal blood counts in the absence of diagnostic criteria for a \nhematologic malignancy , and the term clonal hematopoiesis of \nindeterminate potential (CHIP) has been proposed to describe such \nsituations.40 In patients with eosinophilia in whom causes for HE R have \nbeen excluded, additional cytogenetic or molecular testing and \nmorphologic evaluation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood may be \nuseful to confirm the differential diagnosis of CHIP v ersus CEL , NOS , \nsince the composite picture of morphology and cytogenetic/molecular \ntesting may allow for a more definitive determination of the presence of an \neosinophilia- associated hematolymphoid neoplasm.

NGS  via \nmyeloid mutation panel s may also be useful to establish the clonality in \nselected circumstances  where no TK gene fusion s are detected . Mutations \ndetected by NGS may also provide a means to identify HE N from HE R. See \nRole of NGS  below on MS-11.  \nWorkup   \nInitial evaluation should include a history (especially assessment of travel , \nnew medications , recurrent history of infections , and/or family history of \neosinophilia) and physical exam ination, including skin evaluation , \npalpation of the liver and spleen,  and signs/symptoms of an \nimmunodeficiency syndrome.  \nDiagnostic Studies  \nAn elevated IgE level is a non- specific finding in many of the underlying \nconditions (allergies, infections , and L-HES) related to secondary or \nreactive eosinophilia.5,21 As previously noted, an elevated serum tryptase \nis commonly observed in myeloproliferative variant s of HE, particularly in \nmyeloid neoplasms with a PDGFRA  gene  fusion .5,7,21 Serum tryptase is \nelevated in the vast majority of patients with all subtypes of SM , and \neosinophilia is more prevalent in patients with advanced SM.41-43 \nAspergillus -specific  Igs and increased serum IgE are characteristic \nfindings of ABPA.3  Laboratory  testing should include complete blood count ( CBC)  with \ndifferential, comprehensive metabolic panel with uric acid, lactate \ndehydrogenase, liver function tests , and serum tryptase levels . Peripheral \nblood s mear  should be reviewed for the evidence of other blood count \nabnormalities (eg,  eosinophilia, dysplasia, monocytosis , circulating \nblasts ).21  \nAdditional laboratory testing may be considered based on the patient's \nhistory, symptoms, and findings on physical examination.7 This includes \nserology testing for Strongyloides and other parasitic infections; testing for \nantineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA ) and antinuclear antibodies \n(ANA); stool ova and parasites (O&P)  test and GI polymerase chain \nreaction ( PCR) ; quantitative serum Ig levels (including IgE), erythrocyte \nsedimentation rate (ESR) , and/or C -reactive protein (CRP) ; and \naspergillus IgE to evaluate for ABPA.   \nBone marrow aspirate and biopsy with immunohistochemistry  (IHC) for \ntryptase, CD117, CD25, and CD30 and/or flow cytometry for CD117, \nCD25, CD30, and CD20, and reticulin/collagen stains for fibrosis ; \nconventional cytogenetics; fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) and/or \nnested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR)  to \ndetect the TK gene  fusion ; and confirmatory FISH testing to identify \nbreakpoints associated with TK gene fusion is recommended for all \npatients to conf irm the diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm s.14,21  \nThe diagnostic testing algorithms for TK gene fusions are outlined in \nMLNE -3 in the algorithm .

The typical immunophenotype  of L-HES is CD3 -, CD4+, \nCD7-, and CD5++. Other abnormal immunophenotypes include CD3+, \nCD4+ , and CD7- or CD3+, CD4 -, and CD8-.21 When flow cytometry results \nare equivocal, molecular analysis to detect clonal TCR gene \nrearrangements may be additionally helpful to support the diagnosis of \nL-HES.21 STAT3  mutation has also been identified in the CD3- , CD4+ T  \ncells in a patient with L -HES.44 \nEvaluation of Target Organ Involvement  \nElectrocardiogram , cardiac troponin,  and/or N-terminal prohormone B -type \nnatriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) measurement and echocardiogram  \n(ECHO) and/or cardiac MRI (in the presence of elevated cardiac troponin \nor clinical features of cardiac injury) are helpful to establish cardiac \ninvolvement and/or organ damage .38,45,46 \nPulmonary function tests, chest x-ray, and bronchoscopy with \nbronchoalveolar lavage are useful to confirm lung involvement in patients \nwith respiratory symptoms.2 Electromyography and nerve biopsy are \nneeded to confirm eosinophil -induced peripheral neuropathy. Evaluation \nfor sinusitis, nasal polyposis , and sensorineural hearing loss is \nrecommended for patients presenting with ear, nose, and throat  \nsymptoms.2  \nOrgan -directed biopsy (skin, lung,  or liver biopsy) with appropriate IHC is \nneeded to confirm tissue eosinophilia and eosinophil -induced organ \ndamage.2 Endoscopy with relevant mucosal biopsy with IHC ( tryptase , \nCD117, CD25, and CD30 ) is recommended for patients with GI \ninvolvement. Deep skin biopsy that includes  fascia and MRI are useful to \nconfirm cutaneous involvement with eosinophilic fasciitis.  Cytogenetic and Molecular Testing   \nMLN E With PDGFRA Rearrangement  \nFIP1L1::PDGFRA  is the most common gene fusion in MLN E and results \nfrom a n interstitial deletion of CHIC2  gene on chromosome 4q12 .18-20 \nCHIC2  deletion on chromosome 4q12 is undetectable by standard \ncytogenetics and can only be detected by FISH with specific probes  (FISH \nfor the CHIC2  deletion) used  for the identification of the FIP1L1:: PDGFRA  \nrearrangement .19,47 Nested RT-PCR and quantitative RT- PCR (RT -qPCR) \nare more sensitive  for the detection of FIP1L1:: PDGFRA  gene fusion in \nperipheral blood.5,20,47- 49  \nPDGFRA  fusions with other partner genes ( BCR, ETV6, KIF5B, \nCDK5RAP2, STRN, TNKS2 , and FOXP1 ) that are detectable by standard \ncytogenetics have been described. These fusions can be best detected by \nFISH with break -apart probes or RT- PCR for specific TK gene fusions .5,6,20 \nIn addition to these rearrangements, several novel imatinib- sensitive point \nmutations in PDGFRA  have also been identified in patients with \nFIP1L1::PDGFRA –negative HES.50 These alternate PDGFRA  \nrearrangements, like FIP1L1::PDGFRA , are associated with an excellent \nprognosis when treated with imatinib.  \nPeripheral blood or bone marrow FISH have similar sensitivities , and the \ndiagnosis can be made from either source. However, peripheral blood FISH may not robustly detect the deletion due to low  clone size,  and \nfalse -negative results have also been reported with bone marrow \nFISH.\n51,52 Decalcified bone marrow should not be used as this results in a \nyellow autofluorescence in cells that precludes FISH interpretation . Nested \nRT-PCR or RT -qPCR are the methods  of choice to monitor response to \ntreatment during follow -up. However, RT -qPCR is not appropriate for \nscreening at diagnosis and the use of RT -PCR is complicated due to the \nconsiderable diversity of break points within the FIP1L1 gene.53 Therefore, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:50:36 PM.

A dual-color break -apart probe can be used to \nconfirm the partner gene if a specific one is suspected.  \nConventional cytogenetic analysis for t(5;12) followed by confirmatory \nFISH testing with break -apart probes to assess the involvement of \nPDGFRB  is the most effective approach to identify the gene fusion.59 \nConfirmation of PDGFRB rearrangement by FISH is indicated in all \npatients with a 5q31~33 breakpoint.   \nRT-PCR and RT- qPCR are more sensitive for the detection of complex \nand/or cryptic cases not evident by conventional cytogenetics and are well \nsuited to monitor response to treatment .49,60 However, the use of RT- PCR is limited by the large number of partner genes.  RNA sequencing may also \nbe considered in patients  with complex/cryptic fusions.61  \nMLN E With FGFR1 R earrangement  \nFGFR1:: ZMYM2  resulting from t(8;13)(p11;q12) is the most common gene \nfusion occurring in approximately 50% of patients .6,29,30 Several other \npartner  genes have been described. CNTRL ::FGFR1  [t(8;9)(p11;q33)] , \nFGFR1OP ::FGFR1 [t(6;8)(q27;p11)] , and BCR::FGFR1  [t(8;22)(p11.2; \nq11.2)] are the other common gene fusions occurring in about 10% to 29% \nof patients .5,6,30,62,63 RUNX1 mutations have also been reported in patients \nwith acute leukemia and an FGFR1 rearrangement confirmed by FISH .30  \nConventional cytogenetic analysis for t(8;13) followed by confirmatory \nFISH testing using dual -color break -apart probes  for FGFR1  is the \neffective diagnostic approach for the detection of FGFR1:: ZMYM2  gene \nfusion and can be applied to other FGFR1  rearrangements .5,30 \nMLN E With JAK2 R earrangement  \nPCM1 ::JAK2  resulting from t(8;9)(p22;p24) is the most common gene  \nfusion.6,10,64- 66 ETV6 ::JAK2  [t(9;12)(p24;p13)] and BCR::JAK2  \n[t(9;22)(p24;q11)]  are the other  gene fusions  reported only in few \npatients.6,10,67 -69 \nAs with other gene fusion s resulting from a translocation, c onventional \ncytogenetics to identify t(8;9) followed by confirmatory FISH with JAK2  \nbreak -apart probes  is recommended to confirm the diagnosis .6,10 \nMLN E With FLT3 or ABL1 R earrangement  \nETV6 ::FLT3 resulting from t(12;13)(p13;q12)  and ETV6 ::ABL1 resulting \nfrom t(9;12)(q34;p13) are the common gene fusions  involved in the \nmajority of patients .6,34,35,70 FLT3 fusion with o ther partner genes \n(SPTBN1, GOLGB1, TRIP11,  and ZMYM2 ) and c omplex rearrangements PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:50:36 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia  and  \nTyrosine  Kinase Gene Fusions  \nMS-11 resulting from fusion of ABL1  with partner genes  (other than ETV6 ) have \nalso been reported.6,56,71- 73 \nConventional cytogenetics for t(12;13) followed by confirmatory FISH with \nbreak -apart probes or nested RT -PCR (to identify reciprocal ETV6 ::FLT3 \nand FLT3:: ETV6  transcripts) can be used to confirm the presence of \nETV6 ::FLT3 gene fusion.34 However, conventional cytogenetics may be \ninconclusive for the detection of ETV6 ::ABL1 , mainly because the creation \nof the ETV6 ::ABL1 gene  fusion requires at least three chromosomal \nbreaks . In addition,  the gene fusion is not uniform across patients  and \ntypically involves cryptic insertions that  can be missed with routine \ncytogenetics.35 A multiplexed approach using NGS to detect gene fusions \nis now being increasingly adopted by clinical diagnostic laboratories and \nmay be used for both diagnosis and monitoring for minimal residual \ndisease (MRD). FISH with a combination of ETV6  and ABL1  probes, \nRT-PCR, or RNA sequencing are more reliable test s for the identification \nof an ETV6 ::ABL1 fusion.6,35  \nRole of NGS  \nNGS  studies  have also identified driver  mutations involving a broad \nspectrum of genes most frequently involved in DNA methylation/chromatin modifications in patients with idiopathic HES , although the number of \ngenes screened and the rate of mutation detection in these studies have been variable.\n74-77 In one study, myeloid neoplasm -related somatic \nmutations involving a single gene or ≥ 2 genes have been identified in 28% \nof patients (14 of 51) with idiopathic HES, with ASXL1  (43%), TET2 (36%), \nEZH2  (29%), SETBP1  (22%), CBL (14%), and NOTCH1 (14%) being the \nmost frequently mutated genes.75 In another study, 53% of patients (16 of \n30) had at least one candidate mutation with NOTCH1 (27%), SCRIB and \nSTAG2 (17%), and SH2B3 (13%) being the most frequently mutated \ngenes ; clonal TCR rearrangement was present in 13% of patients.76 \nSomatic STAT5B  N642H mutations were reported in 1.6% (27/1715) of patients with eosinophilia.77 The presence of STAT5B  N642H mutation as \na sole abnormality was associated with a shorter overall survival \ncompared to published series in patients with HES, suggesting that these \ncases should be reclassified as CEL -NOS.77 Thus, targeted NGS studies \nwill be helpful to establish clonality in a subset of patients with idiopathic HES leading to re -classification of some cases as CEL- NOS.  \nNGS studies are also useful for the detection of additional molecular abnormalities in patients with MLN E and rearrangement of PDGFRA, \nPDGFRB, FGFR1 , or PCM1 ::JAK2 .\n78-80 In an analysis of 61 patients with \nMLN E and rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1 , or \nPCM1 ::JAK2 , at least one additional mutation  in several other genes \n(ASXL1,  BCOR, DNMT3A, TET2,  RUNX1, ETV6, NRAS, STAT5B,  and \nZRSR2 ) was detected in 14 patients  (23%).78 Patients with FGFR1 \nrearrangement had a significantly higher frequency of additional  mutations \n(83%; 5 of 6 patients ; all had RUNX1  mutation) in comparison to those \nwith PDGFRA (14%; 5 of 35 patients) , PDGFRB  (23%; 3 of 13 patients) , \nor PCM1 ::JAK2  (14%; 1 of 7 patients)  rearrangements . NGS -based gene \nfusion detection techniques have identified genetic variants of CSF3R and \nKIT mutations ( CSF3R  M696T and KIT  P155S) in patients with myeloid \nneoplasms with eosinophilia and FIP1L1:: PDGFRA  rearrangement.79 \nNGS, RNA fusion panel, and/or comparative genomic hybridization can be \nused to identify novel gene fusion or gene fusion events that may not be \ndetectable with other methods when clinical suspicion is high and FISH for \nPDGFRA , PDGFRB , FGFR1 , JAK2 , ABL1 , or FLT3 are negative. As these \ndiagnostics are not broadly available, it is recommended that these cases \nbe discussed with a hematopathologist.  \nNGS studies are not broadly available and currently the prognostic impact \nand pathogenicity of additional mutations detected by NGS have  not been \nestablished. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of these novel mutations on disease course.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia  and  \nTyrosine  Kinase Gene Fusions  \nMS-12 Treatment  Considerations \nAll patients should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team \n(including engagement of other subspecialists based on clinical \npresentation and organ involvement) in specialized centers.  \nAssessment for clinical situations that may require urgent intervention is \nrecommended for all patients. In certain circumstances, i mmediate \ninstitution of oral or high- dose intravenous  cortico steroids may be \nindicated to mitigate organ damage , especially in patients in whom \neosinophil -mediated cardiac damage/heart failure is present or suspected.   \nAs noted earlier, c onsultation with an infectious disease specialist is \nrecommended as clinically indicated for  the management of infectious \ndisease- related complications.  \nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms With Eosinophilia and PDGFRA or \nPDGFRB  Rearrangement  \nImatinib has resulted in high rates of durable hematologic and molecular  \nresponses in the vast majority of patients with MLN E and PDGFRA  or \nPDGFRB  rearrangement .23,28,38,81- 94 Concurrent administration of \ncortico steroids for 7  to 10 days and consultation with a  cardiologist is \nrecommended for patients with symptoms/signs of cardiac involvement including troponinemia, elevated NT- proBNP , and/or abnormal ECHO \nfindings.\n84   \nImatinib 100 mg daily is the recommended dose for induction therapy for \nchronic phase disease in patients with FIP1L1:: PDGFRA  rearrangement. \nImatinib 100 to 400 mg daily is  the recommended  dose for chronic phase \ndisease in patients with PDGFRB  rearrangement , although  400 mg daily is \ngenerally used as the induction dose. Reduction to 100 mg daily can be \nconsidered after achievement of complete hematologic response ( CHR)  \nand complete cytogenetic response ( CCyR).   Blast phase disease may present either as de novo or as disease \nprogression from chronic phase due to cytogenetic/molecular clonal \nevolution, including PDGFRA  mutations associated with development of \nresistance to imatinib  including T674I or D842V .82  \nImatinib  monotherapy (100–400 mg daily) is recommended for blast phase \ndisease (400 mg daily is generally used as the induction dose in patients \nwith PDGFRB rearrangement) . Durable remissions are only rarely \nachieved with induction chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT). In instances when FIP1L1:: PDGFRA  or a PDGFRB \nrearrangement is identified only after the initiation of induction chemotherapy, imatinib should be added to induction chemotherapy  \n(ALL -type chemotherapy for lymphoid blast phase and AML- type \nchemotherapy for myeloid blast phase) , or a return to imatinib \nmonotherapy may also be consider ed.\n28,87   \nIn some cases, the diagnostic testing may not reveal the PDGFRA  or \nPDGFRB  rearrangement. Imatinib may be considered for patients with a \nclinical picture consistent with this diagnostic group.  \nMonitoring Response and Additional Treatment  \nCHR (defined as the normalization of peripheral blood counts and \neosinophilia) by 1 month and CCyR by 3 months is achieved in a vast \nmajority of patients.95  \nMonitoring blood counts (CBC and eosinophilia), imaging to document \ntarget organ response (as clinically indicated) , and peripheral blood or \nbone marrow evaluation ( FISH for FIP1L1 ::PDGFRA since standard \nkaryotyping cannot detect the fusion; standard cytogenetics and/or FISH \nfor PDGFRB ) are recommended at 3 months after initiation of imatinib. \nRT-PCR (if available) can be considered to document molecular response.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms with Eosinophilia  and  \nTyrosine  Kinase Gene Fusions  \nMS-13 Continuation of imatinib at the initial dose is recommended for patients \nachieving a complete response (CHR, CCyR , or complete molecular \nresponse [CMR]). While low doses of 100 to 200 mg daily have been \nsufficient to maintain molecular remission in the majority of patients with \nFIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement, and in some patients  this dose range \nhas been used only once weekly,83 higher doses (maximum of 400 mg \ndaily) may  be required for some patients.84,85  \nMonitoring hematologic response,  cytogenetic response (FISH) , and \nmolecular response (if RT- qPCR is  available)  every  3 and 6 months is \nrecommended for patients achieving a durable complete response to initial treatment. Clinical trial and/or early referral to allogeneic HCT should be \nconsidered for patients with loss of response. Evaluation of patient adherence or drug interactions is recommended prior to initiation of \nadditional treatment for patients with loss of response.  \nAcquired resistance to imatinib mediated by PDGFRA  T674I and D842V \nmutations has been reported in few patients with primarily blast phase \ndisease.\n82,96 Nilotinib, ponatinib,  and sorafenib have shown limited activity \nin patients with PDGFRA  T674I and D842V mutations.96-99 PDGFRB  T681I \nhas been shown to confer resistance to imatinib in vitro , but has not yet \nbeen identified in patients  treated with imatinib;  acquired resistance to \nimatinib mediated by other PDGFRB  mutations has been described only in \ntwo case reports.100- 102 Evaluation for cytogenetic/molecular clonal \nevolution can identify PDGFRA  (T674I and D842V) or PDGFRB  mutations \nconferring resistance to imatinib in patients with loss of response. A n HCT \nevaluation should also be considered.103 If a resistance mutation is found, \nreferral to a specialized treatment center and enrollment in a clinical trial (if \navailable)  is recommended.  \nAvapritinib is approved for indolent SM, advanced SM (aggressive SM, \nSM with an associated hematologic neoplasm, and mast cell leukemia) , \nand also for unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including D842V \nmutations.104- 107 This suggests a possible role for avapritinib in patients \nwith MLN E and PDGFRA  rearrangement  harboring PDGFRA D842V \nmutation resistant to imatinib. If this mutation is identified, a clinical trial of avapritinib is preferred (if available), rather than off -label use.  \nThe feasibility of discontinuation of imatinib in patients with MLN E and \nPDGFRA  rearrangement  who have achieved CMR has been studied \nmostly in retrospective studies in a limited number of patients.\n38,81,108,109 \nThere is substantial variability in the relapse- free survival rates (57% –91% \nat 12 months; 42% –65% at 24 months), although molecular remissions \nhave been re- established after restarting imatinib in most patients \nexperiencing relapse after discontinuation of imatinib.109 The feasibility of \ndiscontinuation of imatinib in patients with MLN E and a PDGFRB \nrearrangement has not been evaluated. At the present time, there are no \ndefinite criteria to identify patients suitable for discontinuation of imatinib \nand it is therefore not recommended outside the context of clinical trials.  \nMyeloid/Lymphoid Neoplasms With Eosinophilia and FGFR1 or \nJAK2 or ABL1 or FLT3  Rearrangement  \nGeneral Approach  \nMLN E with the above- mentioned TK gene fusion s are generally \nassociated with an aggressive clinical course, relapse,  or disease \nprogression to blast phase and allogeneic HCT is the only potentially \ncurative option.9,10,31,35,110  \n Clinical trial is the preferred treatment option for patients with  chronic \nphase disease. Pemigatinib is also a preferred treatment option for patients with chronic phase disease and FGFR1  rearrangement. Dasatinib \nand nilotinib are also preferred treatment options for patients with chronic phase disease and  an ABL1  rearrangement.

Given the rare nature of this disease, available evidence is mainly \nfrom case reports and/or their potential clinical activity is extrapolated from other diseases with the same target. Although TKI ± induction chemotherapy \ntypically does  not result in long- term disease control, it may be of potential benefit when used as a bridge to allogeneic HCT for disease cytoreduction \nprior to transplantation.30,110,112- 114  \nOther TKIs Besides FDA -\nApproved Pemigatiniba,111 With \nActivity Against  FGFR1  TKI With Activity Against  JAK2   TKI With Activity Against  FLT3  TKI With Activity Against   \nABL1 b \nMidostaurin115 \nPonatinib30,99,113,116,117  Ruxolitinib114,118 -120 \nFedratinibc Gilteritinibc \nMidostaurinc \nQuizartinibc \nSorafenib112,121 \nSunitinib121 Dasatinib114 \nNilotinib114 \nAsciminibc \nBosutinibc \nImatinib114 \nPonatinibc \n \na.

In the case of evolving life-threatening end-organ damage, the diagnosis can be made immediately to avoid delay in therapy.  \nb. Validated quantitative criteria for tissue HE do not exist for most tissues at the present time. Consequently, tissue HES is defined by a combination of qualitative and semiquantitative \nfindings that will require revision as new information becomes availab le. \nc. HEN and HE R are prediagnostic checkpoints that should guide further diagnostic evaluations but cannot serve as final diagnoses.  \nd. Clonality of eosinophils is often difficult to demonstrate or is not examined. However, if a myeloid or stem cell neoplasm known to present typically with clonal HE is present or a typical \nmolecular defect is demonstrable (eg, PDGFR  or FGFR  mutations or BCR/ABL1 ), eosinophilia should be considered clonal.  \ne. In a group of patients, HE R might be caused/triggered by other as yet unknown processes because no increase in eosinophilopoietic cy tokine levels can be documented.  \n \nReprinted from Valent P, Klion AD, Horny HP, et al.

In the case of evolving life-threatening end-organ damage, the diagnosis can be made immediately to avoid delay in therapy.  \nb. HE-related organ damage (damage attributable to HE): organ dysfunction with marked tissue eosinophil infiltrates and/or extensiv e deposition of eosinophil -derived proteins (in the \npresence or absence of marked tissue eosinophils) and 1 or more of the following: (1) fibrosis (lung, heart, digestive tract,  skin, and others); (2) thrombosis with or without \nthromboembolism; (3) cutaneous (including mucosal) eryt hema, edema/ angioedema, ulceration, pruritus, and eczema; and (4) peripheral or central neuropathy w ith chronic or \nrecurrent neurologic deficit. Less commonly, other organ system involvement (liver, pancreas, kidney, and other organs) and t he resulting organ damage can be judged as HE -related \npathology, so that the clinician concludes the clinical situation resembles HES. Note that HES can manifest in 1 or more organ systems.  \nc. Clonality of eosinophils is often difficult to demonstrate or is not examined. However, if a myeloid or stem cell neoplasm known to present typically with clonal HE is present or a typical \nmolecular defect is demonstrable (eg, PDGFR  or FGFR  mutations or BCR/ABL1 ), eosinophilia should be considered clonal.  \nd. The lymphoid variant of HES is regarded as a special form of secondary HES by several experts, although its exact nature and pathogenesis remain controversial.  \n \nReprinted from Valent P, Klion AD, Horny HP, et al.
