Of all mesotheliomas, ~85% arise from the \npleura, ~15% arise from the peritoneum, and the remainder (<1%) originate from the pericardium or the tunica vaginalis.1 \n• In the United States, diffuse pleural mesothelioma affects ~3,000 patients each year , with an annual incidence of ~1 in 100,000.2,3\n• The purpose of the pathologic evaluation of mesothelioma is based on the pathologic assessment of tumor tissue, which can be obtained \nfrom core biopsy sampling, pleurectomy, or other more extensive resections such as extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP). Given its rarity \nand overlapping microscopic features with other conditions, the histologic diagnosis of diffuse mesothelioma can be challenging. \n• To establish a pathologic diagnosis of mesothelioma, diagnostic tools that are used clinically include histologic assessment, \nimmunohistochemistry (IHC), cytogenetics, and molecular techniques (such as targeted next-generation sequencing [NGS], fluorescence in \nsitu hybridization [FISH], and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays). Despite the multiple diagnostic toolkits, the diagnosis relies primarily \non proper histologic assessment and IHC.\n• The new edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Thoracic Tumors by the International Agency for Research on \nCancer (IARC) introduced the following changes for 2021 from the previous 2015 edition:1,4\n\u0017New entity: mesothelioma in situ\n\u0017New terminology: diffuse pleural mesothelioma (instead of diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma)\n\u0017New terminology: localized pleural mesothelioma (instead of localized malignant pleural mesothelioma)\n\u0017New terminology: well-differentiated papillary mesothelial tumor (WDPMT , instead of well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma)\n\u0017Genetic tumor syndromes involving the thorax: BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by \nheterozygous germline pathogenic variants in the BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein 1) gene.\n• The descriptions below refer to diffuse mesothelioma, which will be named mesothelioma for the purpose of simplicity.\nMesothelioma Classification\n• Mesothelioma is classified into three histologic types: epithelioid, biphasic (mixed), and sarcomatoid, which have significant prognostic \nvalue.1\n• The determination of histologic types is based on the cytologic features of the tumor:\n\u0017Epithelioid mesothelioma  is characterized by epithelioid-to-round cells.\n\u0017Sarcomatoid mesothelioma is characterized by spindled cells with tapered nuclei.\n\u0017Biphasic mesothelioma contains both epithelioid and sarcomatoid components in various proportions, with each comprising at least 10% \nof the tumor.

Appropriate type \nclassification of mesothelioma is nonetheless important, given the prognostic significance of different histologic types.\n\u0017Studies comparing the concordance between histologic type in initial biopsies with subsequent resections have shown that the accuracy \nof typing increases with a higher number of biopsies.14 While sarcomatoid histology in biopsies is highly predictive of sarcomatoid \nhistology in resections, epithelioid histology in biopsies is not entirely specific and is changed to biphasic or sarcomatoid types in \nresections in up to 20% of patients.14\nHistologic Criteria for Mesothelioma\n• In mesothelioma, the goals of histologic assessment are to confirm the pathologic diagnosis and to determine the histologic type, which \nallows for prognostication and treatment planning. For the diagnosis of mesothelioma, one needs to establish each of the three conditions \nbelow:\n\u0017The lesion is diffuse and not solitary . Correlation with clinical and radiologic findings is needed to confirm that the distribution of the tumor \nis diffuse rather than solitary. While almost all (>99%) mesotheliomas are diffuse, rare cases of localized pleural mesothelioma  have been \ndescribed, which are solitary, have a different pathogenesis, and harbor a relatively less aggressive clinical course.15-18\n\u0017The lesional cells are mesothelial . Given the morphologic overlap between mesothelioma and diverse mimics such as carcinomas, IHC can \nbe used to confirm the presence of mesothelial differentiation in the tumor cells. Other tools such as cytogenetics and molecular analysis \nmay also be helpful in some instances (see next page).\n\u0017The lesional cells are malignant . Histologic assessment is integral to establish that the mesothelial cells are malignant. Morphologic \nfeatures that distinguish mesothelioma from reactive conditions include: 1) invasion into adjacent tissue, such as adipose or fibrous \ntissue, and skeletal muscle; 2) full-thickness serosal involvement; and 3) formation of expansile nodules (considered as a type of fibrous \ntissue invasion). The presence of tissue invasion is considered to be the most reliable criterion in distinguishing mesothelioma from \nreactive mesothelial proliferations.19,20 On the other hand, “worrisome” features such as necrosis, cytologic atypia, and mitoses should be \ninterpreted with caution, since each can be present in reactive pleuritis and do not necessarily indicate malignancy.\n• Interpretation can be difficult when there is limited diagnostic tissue, tangential sectioning, artifacts from histologic processing, and/\nor entrapment of adjacent structures mimicking invasion.19,21 For a mesothelial proliferation that is suspicious for, but not definitive for \nmalignancy, one may report the findings as “atypical mesothelial proliferation” and recommend rebiopsy and/or close follow-up.\n• In the distinction between mesothelioma and benign, reactive mesothelial proliferations, the role of ancillary studies has been limited until \nrecently, where BAP1 or MTAP IHC and CDKN2A  copy number assessment by FISH may aid in the distinction in some instances (see next \npage).22 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:47:05 PM.

Therefore, it is recommended that a panel including at \nleast two mesothelial markers (eg, calretinin, WT1, D2-40) and two carcinoma markers (eg, claudin-4, TTF-1, polyclonal CEA) should be used \nto establish the diagnosis .26\n• Broad-spectrum keratins ( eg, AE1/AE3, pancytokeratin, MNF116) are not specific and are expressed in both mesothelioma and carcinomas. \n• Sarcomatoid mesothelioma often shows focal to absent expression for most mesothelial markers, with the most sensitive marker being  \nD2-40/podoplanin.27 \n• Recently, GATA3 has been explored as a potential diagnostic marker for sarcomatoid mesotheliomas since GATA3 is expressed in only ~10%–\n20% of sarcomatoid carcinoma28 and strongly expressed in all sarcomatoid/desmoplastic mesotheliomas.29\nMarkers to Confirm a Mesothelial Malignant Proliferation\n• Although the distinction between diffuse or localized mesothelioma and reactive mesothelial proliferations primarily relies on histologic \nassessment, this can be challenging in some cases. \n• BAP1, MTAP IHC, and CDKN2A  (p16) FISH are established markers for diagnosing mesothelioma.22 \n\u0017BAP1 IHC is a specific (though not sensitive) marker to distinguish mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial proliferations. \n\u0017BAP1 is a tumor suppressor implicated in the pathogenesis of mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and clear cell renal \ncell carcinoma.30 Recurrent somatic and/or germline mutations in BAP1 are present in mesothelioma. As a surrogate for BAP1 genomic \nstatus, BAP1 IHC is used as a diagnostic marker for mesothelioma, whereas reactive proliferations have intact BAP1 nuclear staining. \nComplete absence of expression or cytoplasmic staining is considered a loss of BAP1 expression. Aberrant BAP1 protein expression, \ndefined as absence of nuclear BAP1 staining, is present in ~50%–70% of mesothelioma epithelioid type31-37 but in  <20% of sarcomatoid \ntype.38\n\u0017MTAP IHC has been used as a diagnostic marker for mesothelioma.39 MTAP is located near CDKN2A  on the chromosomal region 9p21. \nLoss of cytoplasmic MTAP staining is considered a surrogate for chromosomal 9p loss as determined by concurrent CDKN2A  FISH \ntesting39 and has been reported in ~40%–60% of mesothelioma but rarely in reactive proliferations.35-37 \n\u0017Although MTAP alone is not sensitive, combined use of BAP1 and MTAP IHC may improve sensitivity and specificity.35-37 Since ~10%–20% \nof lung adenocarcinomas have MTAP loss,36 MTAP IHC is not useful for distinction between mesothelioma and lung carcinoma.\n• Additional IHC markers such as 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine (5-HMC), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), cyclin D1, and programmed death \nligand 1 (PD-L1),  and NF2 by FISH are all potentially useful to distinguish mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial proliferations, but need \nfurther study since their utility in clinical practice remains unclear.22 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:47:05 PM.

Furthermore, distinction between a mesothelioma with prominent papillary surface projections and WDPMT can be \nchallenging, particularly in small superficial biopsies. \n\u0017Adenomatoid tumor  primarily affects the genital tracts but rarely can involve the pleura; recurrent mutations in TRAF7 have been described \nin adenomatoid tumors of genital type.72\n\u0017Peritoneal inclusion cyst  is a benign, rare tumor that displays multiple mesothelial-lined cysts that may be distinguished from mesothelial \nneoplasia. This lesion is almost always located in the peritoneum, although uncommon cases have been described in the pleura. These \ncystic proliferations are lined by bland mesothelial cells and lack significant stratification, papillary structures, or atypia.\n\u0017Mesothelioma in situ  is a preinvasive, single-layer surface proliferation of neoplastic mesothelial cells. Since the diagnosis of \nmesothelioma in situ cannot be simply made on conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains, the diagnosis requires either 1) loss of \nBAP1 nuclear expression by IHC; and/or 2) CDKN2A  homozygous deletion identified either by FISH or by MTAP IHC (cytoplasmic staining). \nFurthermore, no mass lesions should be identified on imaging or thoracoscopy .PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:47:05 PM.

See Recommended Doses for Radiation Therapy (PM-D 2 of 3).\n• A dose ≥60 Gy should be delivered to macroscopic residual tumors if the doses to adjacent normal structures are limited to their tolerances. \nIn addition to covering the surgical bed within the thorax, the volume of postoperative radiation should also include the surgical scars and \nbiopsy tracks in the chest wall.7-9\n• Daily doses of 4 Gy appear to be more efficacious than fractions of  <4 Gy in providing relief from chest pain associated with \nmesothelioma,8,10 although the optimal daily and total dose of RT for palliative purposes remains unclear. \n• For patients with residual tumors, some experienced investigators have used brachytherapy or intraoperative external beam RT (EBRT) in \ncombination with surgery.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:47:05 PM.

These \ntechnologies include (but are not limited to) 4D-CT and/or PET/CT simulation, IMRT/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), IGRT, motion \nmanagement, and proton therapy.\n• Special attention should be paid to minimize radiation to the contralateral lung,12 as the risk of fatal pneumonitis with IMRT is excessively \nhigh when strict limits are not applied.13 The contralateral uninvolved mean lung dose (MLD) should be kept as low as possible, preferably \n<8.5 Gy. The low-dose volume should be minimized.14 For postoperative RT for patients who have P/D, other recommended specific lung-\npreserving techniques are advised. Limit the ipsilateral lung dose to decrease risk of pneumonitis and keep total MLD <21 Gy and V20 <40% \nand contralateral lung V20 <7% and MLD <8 Gy.15 \n• The gross tumor volume (GTV) should include any grossly visible tumor. Surgical clips (indicative of gross residual tumor) should be \nincluded for postoperative adjuvant RT.\n• The clinical target volume (CTV) for adjuvant RT after P/D should encompass the entire pleural surface (for partial resection cases), surgical \nclips, and any potential sites with residual disease.  \n• Extensive elective nodal irradiation (ENI) (entire mediastinum and bilateral supraclavicular nodal regions) is not recommended.\n• The planning target volume (PTV) should consider the target motion and daily setup errors. The PTV margin should be based on the \nindividual patient's motion, simulation techniques used (with and without inclusion motion), and reproducibility of each clinic’ s daily setup.Recommended Doses for Radiation Therapy\nGeneral Principles and Radiation Dose and Volume (PM-D 1 of 3) References (PM-D 3 of 3)Treatment type Total dose Fraction size Treatment duration\nPalliative\nChest wall pain from recurrent nodules 20–40 Gy\nor 30 Gy≥4 Gy\n3 Gy1–2 weeks\n2 weeks\nMultiple brain or bone metastases 30 Gy 3 Gy 2 weeks\nPost P/D\nHigher dose to higher risk areas45–60 Gy 1.8–2 Gy 5–6 weeksPRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPYPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:47:05 PM.

Ann Thorac Surg \n2014;97:1859-1865.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY1\n• Surgical resection should be performed on carefully evaluated patients by thoracic surgeons with experience in managing pleural \nmesothelioma.\n• Decisions regarding surgical options for treatment are highly dependent on accurate histology. Pleural biopsy for diagnosis should provide \nenough tissue for differentiation of epithelioid, sarcomatoid, or mixed histology and clearly exclude metastatic pleural involvement of \nanother primary. Cytology is generally not considered adequate for important histologic differentiation required for treatment decisions.\n• For patients being considered for surgery, a single-port thoracoscopy on the line of the potential incision is recommended.\n• The goal of surgery is complete gross cytoreduction of the tumor. The goal of cytoreductive surgery is “macroscopic complete resection”—in \nother words, removal of ALL visible or palpable tumors. In cases where this is not possible, such as in multiple sites of chest wall invasion, \nsurgery should be aborted. If it is possible to remove most of the gross disease to help with postoperative management, with a minimal \nimpact on morbidity, then surgery should be continued. \n• The surgical choices are: 1) P/D with mediastinal lymph node sampling, which is defined as complete removal of the pleura and all gross tumor \n± en-bloc resection of pericardium and/or diaphragm with reconstruction; and 2) EPP, which is defined as en-bloc resection of the pleura, lung, \nipsilateral diaphragm, and often pericardium. Mediastinal node sampling should be performed with a goal to obtain at least 3 nodal stations.\n• For early-stage disease (confined to the pleural envelope, no clinical evidence for lymph node involvement) with favorable histology \n(epithelioid), P/D may be considered but it is unclear whether there is benefit over systemic therapy alone. There is controversy regarding a \ndecision for surgical resection that needs to be weighed, taking into account tumor histology, distribution, the patient's pulmonary reserve, and \navailability of adjuvant and intraoperative strategies. P/D is the preferred surgical treatment option and can be considered in select patients for \ncomplete gross cytoreduction. EPP may be selected in certain cases that require careful consideration of the total treatment plan that includes \nthe patient and  multidisciplinary team.2-5\n• If N2 disease is identified, prognosis with surgery (and other therapy) is substantially diminished. Surgical resection should only be considered \nin the setting of a clinical trial or at a center with expertise in pleural mesothelioma.\n• If technically appropriate for even more advanced disease, lung-sparing operations like P/D reduce the risk for perioperative mortality and \nmay be acceptable in terms of achieving complete macroscopic resection.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Pleural  \n \nMS-2 Overview \nMesothelioma is a rare cancer originating in mesothelial surfaces of the \npleura and other sites that is estimated to occur in approximately 3500  \npeople in the United States every year.1-5 These NCCN Clinical Practice \nGuidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) focus on pleural \nmesothelioma (PM), which is the most common type (approximately 85%).  \nMesothelioma can also occur in the lining of other sites , such as the \nperitoneum  (approximately  15%) , pericardium, and tunica vaginalis \ntestis.6-9 PM is difficult to treat, because most patients have advanced \ndisease at presentation. Median overall survival is approximately 1 year  \nafter diagnosis of PM, and 5- year overall survival is about 10%; cure is \nrare.2,10- 14 PM occurs mainly in older males  (median age at diagnosis, 72 \nyears) who have been exposed to asbestos, although death  occurs \ndecades after exposure (approximately 32 years later  [range, 13–70 \nyears] ).14-17  \nThese NCCN Guidelines® for Mesothelioma : Pleural  were first published in \n2010 and have been subsequently updated every year . The Summary of \nthe Guidelines Updates  section in the algorithm briefly describes the new \nchanges for 2022, which are described in greater detail in this revised Discussion text; recent references have been added.  For example, a new \nsection on pathology was added for the 2022 update (see Principles of  \nPathologic Review in the algorithm ). Additional supplementary material in \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Mesothelioma: Pleural includes the Principles of  \nSystemic T herapy , Principles of Supportive Care,  Principles of Surgery , \nand Principles of Radiation Therapy.  These NCCN Guidelines for \nMesothelioma: Pleural  were developed and are updated by panel \nmembers who also update the NCCN Guidelines for Mesothelioma: \nPeritoneal  and the NCCN Guidelines for Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer.   \nAsbestos use has decreased since the 1970s; however, the United States \nstill has more reported cases and deaths from PM than anywhere else in the world  because of the long latency period before the disease \noccurs .\n1,18- 21 The mortality burden from asbestos -related diseases in the \nUnited States did not change from 1999 to 2015.10,22,23 Although asbestos \nis no longer mined in the United States, it is still imported.21 The incidence \nof PM is increasing in other countries such as Russia, Western Europe, \nChina, and India.3,20,24- 29 Mortality rates from PM are highest in the United \nKingdom, Netherlands, and Australia; mortality rates are increasing in Poland, Spain, China, Japan, Argentina, Republic of Korea, and \nBrazil.\n12,24,25,30 Russia, China, Brazil, and Canada are the top producers of \nasbestos.31  \nAlthough most mesothelioma is linked to asbestos exposure, reports \nsuggest that ionizing radiation may also cause mesothelioma, such as in \npatients previously treated with mantle radiation for Hodgkin \nlymphoma.32-42 Two meta- analyses suggest that non- occupational \nexposure to asbestos is a risk factor for PM.43,44 Data also suggest that \nerionite (a mineral that may be found in gravel roads) is associated with \nmesothelioma.45-48 Genetic factors may also play a role in PM, with rare \nfamilies carrying a germline mutation in the BRCA1 -associated protein -1 \n(BAP1 ) gene.45,49 -58 Patients with germline BAP1  mutations have \nprolonged survival.53,56 BAP1  is one of the most frequently altered genes \nin patients with mesotheliomas; however, other genes may also be altered such as NF2 , TP53 , and SETD2  (see Principles of Pathologic Review in \nthe algorithm).\n59-63 Smoking is not a risk factor for mesothelioma.64 \nHowever, patients who smoke and have been exposed to asbestos are at \nincreased risk for lung cancer.65 Patients who smoke should be \nencouraged to quit because smoking impedes treatment (eg, delays wound healing after surgery) (see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking \nCessation, available at www.NCCN.org\n).66 Some patients who have been \nexposed to asbestos only have benign pleural disease, although they may have significant chest pain.\n67,68 Although screening for mesothelioma has \nbeen studied in patients at high risk (ie, those with asbestos exposure), PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:47:05 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Pleural  \n \nMS-3 these NCCN Guidelines do not recommend screening for PM because it \nhas not been shown to decrease mortality (see Initial Evaluation  in the \nalgorithm ).31,65,69 -75 Note that data and guidelines about screening for lung \ncancer with low -dose CT do not apply to PM; there are no data to suggest \nthat screening  with low- dose CT improves survival for patients with \nPM.31,65,76- 79 \nLiterature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update Methodology  \nAn electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain \nkey literature on mesothelioma using the following search term: malignant \npleural mesothelioma.  The PubMed database was chosen because it \nremains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature. The search results were narrowed by \nselecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial, Phase 2; Clinical Trial, Phase 3 ; \nClinic al Trial,  Phase 4; Guideline; Meta- Analysis;  Randomized Controlled \nTrial; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines and discussed by the \npanel have been included in this version of the Discussion section (eg, \ne-publications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). If high- level evidence is \nlacking , then recommendations are based on the panel’s review of \nlower -level evidence and expert opinion. The complete details of the \nDevelopment and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at  \nwww.NCCN.org\n.  \nDiagnosis \nPresentation and Evaluation  \nPatients with suspected PM often have dyspnea and chest pain; they may \nalso have pleural effusion, fatigue, insomnia, cough, chest wall mass, loss \nof appetite, and weight loss (see the NCCN Guidelines for Adult Cancer Pain, available at www.NCCN.org ).30,80,81 Patients with PM often have a \nhigh symptom burden when compared with patients who have other types of cancer  (see Principles of Supportive Care  in the algorithm) . Symptoms \nsuch as chest pain and/or dyspnea are associated with local disease . \nPatients often present without distant metastases ; CNS metastases are \nuncommon.\n69  \nIn patients with recurrent pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening, the \nrecommended initial evaluation for suspected PM includes: 1) CT with \ncontrast of the chest; 2) pleural biopsy (eg, thoracoscopic biopsy \n[preferred]) ; and 3) thoracentesis for cytologic assessment of the effusion \n(see Initial Evaluation in the algorithm ).30,31,69,82- 87 However, cytologic \nsamples are often negative even when patients have PM.88,89 Fine- needle \naspiration (FNA) is not recommended for diagnosis , although \nendobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)/endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) FNA may \nbe used to assess mediastinal lymph nodes .30  \nTalc pleurodesis or pleural catheter may be needed for management of \npleural effusion (see Principles of Supportive Care  in the algorithm) .69,90 -99 \nDrainage is preferred for patients with potentially operable disease, whereas either drainage or pleurodesis are options for patients who are \nmedically inoperable.\n90 Soluble mesothelin- related peptide (SMRP) levels \nmay also be assessed, and these levels may correlate with disease status;\n100- 103 osteopontin does not appear to be as useful for \ndiagnosis.69,104 -108 Other potential diagnostic biomarkers are being \nassessed.70-72,109- 113 \nPathology  \nThe NCCN Guidelines include an extensive section on pathologic evaluation of tumor tissue to diagnose PM (see Principles of Pathologic \nReview in the algorithm). The goals of assessment are to confirm the \npathologic diagnosis of PM and to determine the histology.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Pleural  \n \nMS-4 subtypes of mesothelioma include epithelioid (most common), \nsarcomatoid, and biphasic (mixed ), which includes  epithelioid and \nsarcomatoid.4,63,114,115 Patients with epithelioid histology have better \noutcomes than those with either mixed or sarcomatoid histologies.  It is \nessential to determine the histology, which is used to direct treatment. The WHO introduced several changes in 2021 for mesothelioma including new \nterminology: 1) diffuse pleural mesothelioma; 2) localized pleural \nmesothelioma; and 3) well -differentiated papillary mesothelioma (see \nPrinciples of Pathologic Review in the algorithm).\n63 \nIt can be difficult to distinguish malignant from benign pleural disease \n(such as reactive pleuritis) and also to distinguish PM from other \nmalignancies such as metastatic adenocarcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma, \nor other metastases to the pleura.26,116 -123 Almost all PMs are diffuse \n(>99%); however, rare cases of localized pleural mesothelioma have been \ndiagnosed, which are less aggressive.124- 128 It is also difficult to distinguish \nlocalized PM from diffuse PM.124 On CT, thymoma  metastatic to the pleura \ncan mimic PM; however, pleural effusion does not typically occur with thymoma. Cytologic samples of pleural fluid are often negative  or \ninconclusive, but diagnosis can sometimes be made using cytology .\n69,88,89,129,130 Immunohistochemical markers are used to diagnose \nPM, including markers specific for PM  (eg, WT1, calretinin, D2- 40) and \nmarkers that typically are positive in carcinoma and negative in \nmesothelioma (eg, thyroid transcription factor 1 [TTF- 1], polyclonal \ncarcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], claudin-4 ) (see Principles of Pathologic \nReview in the algorithm and Protocol for the Examination of Specimens \nFrom Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma from the College of \nAmerican Pathologists [CAP]).69,88,117,120,122,131,132 A panel of two positive \nmesothelial markers and two negative markers is recommended for diagnosis of PM.\n117 The presence or absence of BAP1  nuclear expression \nassessed by immunohistochemistry can be used in the differential diagnosis of mesothelioma.\n133- 135  Rare driver mutations have been identified in patients with PM,  such as \nEWSR1 -ATF1 fusions , TP53, NF2 , SETDB1, or SETD2 .59-62,136,137 A recent \nanalysis in 229 patients with PM identified seven somatic driver mutations including BAP1, NF2, TP53, SETD2, LATS2, DDX3X , and SETDB1 ; \ntargeted agents are being assessed .\n136,138 -141 NTRK  and ALK fusions have \nbeen identified in patients with PM, although at very low frequencies \n(0.6%).138,142,143 Targeted agents are available for NTRK  and ALK fusions \n(see the NCCN Guidelines for Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). Patients with PM have low tumor mutational burden.60,61 \nFor the 2022 update, the NCCN Panel now recommends broad molecular \nprofiling for patients with PM to identify rare driver alterations (eg, ALK or \nNTRK  fusions) for which effective drugs may be available or to counsel \npatients about clinical trials.60,138  \nManagement  \nThe NCCN Guidelines recommend that patients with PM be managed by a \nmultidisciplinary team with experience in PM. A general overview of \nmanagement is provided here; specific details are provided in the following sections (see Surgery , Systemic Therapy , and Radiation Therapy  in this \nDiscussion). Treatment options for patients with PM include surgery, \nradiation therapy (RT), and/or systemic therapy .\n4 Most patients have \nadvanced disease at presentation, and surgery is not recommended for these patients. Trimodality therapy —using chemotherapy, surgery, and \nhemithoracic RT—has been assessed in patients with medically operable \nPM.\n144- 151 Median survival of up to 20 to 29 months has been reported for \npatients who complete trimodality therapy.147,150 Nodal status and \nresponse to systemic therapy can affect survival.150,152 Appropriate \npatients should be evaluated by radiation oncologists, surgeons, medical oncologists, diagnostic imaging specialists, and pulmonologists to assess \nif they are candidates for multimodality treatment. S elect patients with \nmedically operable disease are candidates for multimodality therapy , \nincluding those with clinical stages I  to IIIA PM and epithelioid histology PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:47:05 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Pleural  \n \nMS-5 and good performance status (PS).148- 154 Surgical resection is \nrecommended for certain patients with clinical stage I to III A PM who are \nmedically operable and can tolerate the surgery.  Patients who are \ncandidates for surgery may have preoperative or postoperative \nchemotherapy followed by postoperative RT. Systemic therapy alone is \nrecommended for patients  with PS 0 to 2 and medically inoperable PM \n(see Systemic Therapy  in this Discussion and Treatment  in the \nalgorithm ).155,156 Definitive RT alone is not recommended in any setting for \npatients with PM.  \nObservation for progression may be considered for patients with PS 0 to 2 who are not eligible for surgery and are asymptomatic with minimal burden \nof disease if systemic therapy is planned when progression occurs (either \nradiologic or symptomatic progress ion). Best supportive care is \nrecommended for patients with PS 3 to 4  (see Chemotherapy  in this \nDiscussion and Principles of Systemic Therapy  and Principles of \nSupportive Care in the algorithm ). Pleural effusion can be managed using \nthoracoscopic talc pleurodesis or placement of a drainage \ncatheter.\n69,90- 95,99,157- 159 Therapeutic/palliative thoracentesis can also be \nused to remove pleural fluid and thus decrease dyspnea either before treatment or for patients who are not candidates for more aggressive \ntreatment.\n30 \nPretreatment Evaluation  \nFor patients diagnosed with PM , pretreatment evaluation, using chest and \nabdominal CT with contrast , is recommended  to stage patients and to \nassess whether patients are candidates for surgery.83,84,160 For patients \nwith a clinical diagnosis of stages I to IIIA PM with epithelioid histology \nwho are being considered for surgery , additional testing may be done to \nrule out metastatic disease, including 1) FDG PET/CT; 2) mediastinoscopy \nor EBUS/EUS  FNA of the mediastinal lymph nodes ;161,162 3) optional chest \nMRI with contrast to evaluate possible chest wall, spinal, diaphragmatic, or vascular involvement; and 4) v ideo- assisted thorac oscopic  surgery (VATS) \nor laparoscopy can be considered if contralateral or peritoneal disease is \nsuspected  to rule out transdiaphragmatic extension (eg, extension to the \nperitoneum is indicative of stage IV [unresectable] disease).163 PET/CT  \nscans should be obtained before pleurodesis if practical , because talc \nproduces pleural inflammation, which can affect the fluorodeoxyglucose \n(FDG ) avidity (ie, false -positive result).164- 166 Patients with clinical stage I to \nIIIA epithelioid PM are evaluated to assess whether they can tolerate \nsurgery using 1) pulmonary function tests (PFTs) , including diffusing \ncapacity for carbon di oxide (DLCO ); 2) perfusion scanning (if forced \nexpiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] <80%) ; and 3) cardiac stress tests \n(see Surgical Evaluation in the algorithm ). \nStaging  \nPatients who are not candidates for surgery  only have clinical staging. It is \ndifficult to clinically stage patients using CT , MRI, or PET/CT ; therefore, \npatients who have surgery may be upstaged.  Understaging is common \nwith PET/CT .166,167 However, PET/CT  is useful for determining whether \nmetastatic disease is present.167,168 Surgical s taging is performed using the \nInternational Mesothelioma Interest Group (IMIG) TNM staging system (see Staging in the algorithm ), which was approved by the AJCC.\n169- 172  \nSurgery  \nSurgery is recommended as a component of combined modality therapy \nfor certain patients with stage I to IIIA PM who are medically operable.173 \nThe NCCN Panel recommends surgery for certain patients with clinical \nstage I to III A PM and epithelioid histology.174 Surgery may be considered \nfor certain patients with early -stage PM who have biphasic histology.147,175 \nHowever, surgery is generally not an option for those with stage IIIB or IV \nPM regardless of histology. It is essential that patients receive a careful \nassessment before surgery is performed.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Pleural  \n \nMS-6 Surgical resection for patients with PM can include either 1) \npleurectomy/decortication (P/D; also known as total pleurectomy, \nlung- sparing surgery), which is complete removal of the involved pleura \nand all gross tumor  with or without en -bloc resection of the pericardium \nand/or diaphragm; or 2) extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP), which is \nen-bloc resection of the involved pleura, lung, ipsilateral diaphragm, and \noften the pericardium (see Principles of Surgery  in the algorithm ).176 \nExtended P/D refers to the resection of the diaphragm and pericardium in \naddition to total pleurectomy.176 Mediastinal nodal dissection is \nrecommended in patients having either P/D or EPP; at least 3 nodal stations should be obtained (see the NCCN Guidelines for Non -Small Cell \nLung Cancer, available at www.NCCN.org\n). The surgical goal for PM is \ncytoreductive surgery to achieve macroscopic complete resection by \nremoving all visible or palpable tumors .177,178 If macroscopic complete \nresection is not possible —such as patients with multiple sites of chest wall \ninvasion—then surgery should be aborted. However, surgery should be continued—if most of the gross disease can be removed— to help with \npostoperative management and if there will be a minimal impact on morbidity. \n \nThe choice of surgery for PM is controversial, because data from \nrandomized controlled trials are not available.4,30,69,173,179- 187 Neither EPP \nnor P/D will yield an R0 resection.4,188,189 EPP would often be required to \nremove all gross tumor in patients with stages II to III A PM.81 However, \nEPP is associated with higher morbidity and mortality.183,190 P/D (ie, \nlung- preserving surgery) is safer than EPP.190- 197 A retrospective analysis \n(n = 663) suggested that survival was greater after P/D than after EPP, but this analysis may have been confounded by patient selection.\n4,195 Another \nretrospective analysis compared EPP (n = 187) versus P/D (n = 95) in patients with PM.\n198 Median overall survival was 15 months for patients \nreceiving EPP versus 22 months for P/D ( P = .276). Perioperative \nmortality was 11% for those receiving EPP versus 0% for P/D ( P = .031). A large meta -analysis (n = 2903) suggests that 30 -day mortality is \nimproved with P/D versus EPP; 2 -year mortality was similar between the \narms.15,183 Another meta- analysis (n = 500) suggests that P/D is \nassociated with decreased 30- day mortality and complications (especially \nsupraventricular arrhythmia ) when compared with EPP.180 Lung- sparing \noptions, such as P/D, reduce the risk for perioperative mortality when \ncompared with EPP and yield either equal or better long- term survival than \nnon-surgical therapy in patients with more advanced disease.188,199 \nA feasibility trial (Mesothelioma and Radical Surgery [MARS]) assessed \nwhether patients treated with induction chemotherapy would accept \nrandomization to EPP or no surgery; 112 patients were enrolled in the trial, \nand 50 patients were randomized.200 The authors concluded that due to \nthe observed high rate of surgical mortality, EPP was not beneficial when \ncompared with chemotherapy treatment alone. However, these results \nwere controversial because survival was not the primary outcome of the \nstudy, the sample size was small, and the surgical mortality was higher \nthan expected.201 An Australian retrospective study (540 patients) reported \nthat several factors yielded increased survival for select patients, including \nEPP, surgeon experience, and treatment with pemetrexed.202  \nThe NCCN Panel feels that P/D and EPP are reasonable surgical options that should be considered in select patients to achieve complete gross \ncytoreduction.\n183,195,200,203,204 Although P/D may be safer than EPP, it is not \nclear which operation is oncologically better. When surgery is indicated, the choice between P/D and EPP should be made based on several \nfactors , including tumor histology and distribution, stage, pulmonary \nreserve, surgical experience and expertise, and  availability of adjuvant and \nintraoperative strategies.\n11,204 In patients who are medically operable, the \ndecision about whether to do a P/D or an EPP may not be made until surgical exploration. P/D may be more appropriate for patients with \nadvanced PM who cannot tolerate an EPP.\n191 P/D may also be useful for PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:47:05 PM.

Surgical resection should only be considered for \npatients with N2 disease at a center of expertise in PM or in a clinical trial.  \nSystemic Therapy  \nChemotherapy is recommended as part of a multimodality regimen for \npatients with medically operable PM (see Treatment  and Principles of \nSystemic Therapy  in the algorithm ). Patients with medically operable \nstage I to III A PM can receive chemotherapy either before or after surgery. \nSystemic therapy alone is recommended for patients with 1) stage IIIB or \nIV PM (PS 0 –2) regardless of histology; 2) those with sarcomatoid or \nbiphasic histology, regardless of clinical stage; or 3) medically inoperable stages I to IV PM , or those who refuse surgery .\n184,205- 207 All of the regimens \nrecommended for PM can also be used for peritoneal mesothelioma, \npericardial mesothelioma,  and tunica vaginalis testis mesothelioma.7,208 -210  \nMedically Operable PM  \nTrimodality therapy —using chemotherap y, surgery, and hemithoracic \nRT—has been studied in patients with medically operable PM.144- 151 \nMedian survival of up to 20 to 29 months has been reported for patients \nwho complete trimodality therapy.147,150 Nodal status and response to \nchemotherapy can affect survival.150,152 In patients who do not receive \ninduction chemotherapy before EPP, postoperative sequential \nchemotherapy with hemithoracic RT is recommended; hemithoracic \npleural IMRT may be considered at centers that have expertise with this \ntherapy for patients who have had P/D . Intraoperative adjuvant \ntherapies —such as hyperthermic pleural lavage, photodynamic therapy, or heated chemotherapy —have also been  studied, however, they are of \nunclear benefit .211- 220  \nA phase 2 trial assessed trimodality therapy in 77 eligible patients with resectable PM.\n150 Patients received preoperative chemotherapy with \ncisplatin/pemetrexed followed by EPP in 54 patients and then hemithoracic RT. In the overall population, median survival was 16.8 \nmonths (95% CI, 13.6– 23.2). For patients who completed all of the \ntrimodalit y therapy, median overall survival was 29.1 months with a 2 -year \nsurvival of 61.2%.   \nAnother  phase 2 trial assessed trimoda lity therapy in eligible patients \nwith resectable PM.\n147 Patients received preoperative chemotherapy with \ncisplatin/pemetrexed, carboplatin/pemetrexed, or cisplatin/gemcitabine \nfollowed by EPP and intensity -modulated RT (IMRT) in 62 patients. The \nmedian overall survival was 20.4 months. The 1 -year overall survival rate \nwas 63%; the 2- year overall survival rate was 42%.  Patients with biphasic \nhistology had a worse outcome compared with those who had epithelioid histology.  \nA phase 2 trial assessed trimodality therapy in 61 eligible patients with \nresectable PM.\n151 Patients received neoadjuvant therapy with \ncisplatin/gemcitabine; 45 patients had EPP and 36 patients had postoperative RT.

CheckMate 743, a phase 3 randomized \ntrial, assessed first -line therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus \nplatinum/pemetrexed chemotherapy in 605 patients with unresectable \nPM.222 Many patients had epithelioid histology (75%). Most of the patients \nwere males (77%), and the median age was 69 years. The median overall survival in the entire population was 18.1 months (95% CI, 16.8– 21.4) in \npatients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 14.1 months (95% CI, 12.4– 16.2) in those receiving chemotherapy (HR, 0.74; 96.6% CI, 0.60–\n0.91). The 2- year overall survival rate was 41% (95% CI, 35.1% –46.5%) in \nthe nivolumab plus ipilimumab group versus 27% (95% CI, 21.9% –32.4%) \nin the chemotherapy group in the entire population. Although the trial was not powered to assess superiority within the subgroups, the data are \ninteresting. In patients with epithelioid histology, the median overall \nsurvival was 18.7 months (95% CI, 16.9–22.0) in patients receiving \nnivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 16.5 months (95% CI, 14.9– 20.5) in those receiving chemotherapy (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.69– 1.08). In patients \nwith nonepithelioid histology, the median overall survival was 18.1 months (95% CI, 12.2– 22.8) in patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab \nversus 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.4– 10.2) in those receiving chemotherapy \n(HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.31 –0.68). Grade 3 to 4 treatment -related adverse \nevents were similar in both groups: 30% (91/300) of patients receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 32% (91/284) of those receiving \nchemotherapy. Three treatment -related deaths (1%) occurred in the \nnivolumab plus ipilimumab group, which were due to pneumonitis, encephalitis, and heart failure; one death (<1%) occurred in the \nchemotherapy group, which was due to myelosuppression.  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends  (category 1) nivolumab plus ipilimumab for \neligible patients with unresectable PM based on clinical trial data and the \nFDA approval (see Principles of Systemic Therapy  in the algorithm ).\n222 \nTesting for PD -L1 is not required for prescribing nivolumab for therapy \nfor patients with PM . Immune -related adverse events, such as \npneumonitis, may occur with nivolumab  plus ipilimumab (see the NCCN \nGuidelines for Management of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities, \navailable at www.NCCN.org ).223- 225 Intravenous high -dose corticosteroids  \nshould be administered based on the severity of the reaction for patients \nwith immune -mediated adverse events. Nivolumab plus ipilimumab \nshould be discontinued for patients with severe or life- threatening \npneumonitis and should be withheld or discontinued for other severe or \nlife-threatening immune- mediated adverse events when indicated (see \nprescribing information).  Ipilimumab  can also cause immune -mediated \nadverse events  such as hepatitis and endocrinopathies.   \nA phase 3 randomized trial assessed cisplatin/pemetrexed versus cisplatin \nalone in patients with PM who were not candidates for surgery; the \ncombined regimen increased survival by 2.8 months when compared with \ncisplatin alone (12.1 vs. 9.3 months, P = .02).226 The PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:47:05 PM.

Grade 3 to 4 adverse \nevents were reported in 71% (158/222) of patients receiving the \nbevacizumab regimen when compared with 62% (139/224) of those \nreceiving cisplatin/pemetrexed alone. More grade 3 or higher hypertension \n(23%  vs. 0% ), grade 3 proteinuria (3.1%  vs. 0% ), and grade 3 to 4 \nthrombotic events ( 6% vs. 1% ) were observed in patients receiving the \ntriplet arm. T he NCCN Panel recommends  (category 1) bevacizumab, \ncisplatin, and pemetrexed followed by maintenance bevacizumab for \nbevacizumab- eligible patients with unresectable PM regardless of \nhistology based on this trial (see Principles of Systemic Therapy  in the \nalgorithm ).234 Contraindications to bevacizumab include uncontrolled \nhypertension, risk for bleeding or clotting, and substantial cardiovascular \nmorbidity.69 An FDA -approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for \nbevacizumab.  A phase 2 trial assessed adding bevacizumab to carboplatin/pemetrexed \nwith or without maintenance bevacizumab as first -line therapy for patients \nwith unresectable PM.235 Overall survival was 15.3 months; 34% (26/76) of \npatients had a partial response and 58% (44/76) had stable disease. \nBowel perforation occurred in 4% of patients, and grade 3 to 4 fatigue \noccurred in 8%; there were 3 toxic deaths. Maintenance bevacizumab \n(maximum, 1 year) was administered to patients without progression \nand/or severe toxicities. The NCCN Panel recommends (category 2A) \nadding bevacizumab to carboplatin/pemetrexed with or without maintenance bevacizumab as a first -line therapy option for pat ients with \nunresectable PM based on this trial.\n235 Gemcitabine/cisplatin was \nassessed in phase 2  studies (median survival , 9.6–14.1 months).236- 238 \nGemcitabine/cisplatin may be useful for patients who cannot take \npemetrexed.

Many patients had received \nthird-line therapy (56%). Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% \nCI, 8.5 –12.1) in patients receiving nivolumab versus 6.9 months (95% CI, \n5.0–8.0) in those receiving placebo (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52– 0.91). Grade \n3 or worse adverse events were reported in 3% of patients receiving \nnivolumab (diarrhea and infusion- related reaction, 6/221).

The overall response rate was 28% (95% CI, 16% –40%) with nivolumab/ipilimumab \nversus 19% (95% CI, 8% –29%) with nivolumab alone. The disease control \nrate at 12 weeks was 52% (32/62) for nivolumab/ipilimumab versus 40% \n(25/63) for nivolumab alone.247 Positive PD- L1 levels were associated with \noverall response rate, especially high PD -L1 levels of 25% or more . \nHowever, only a few patients had very high PD -L1 expression levels of \n50% or more. There were more grade 3 to 4 adverse events in the \nnivolumab/ipilimumab arm when compared with the nivolumab alone arm \n(26% vs. 14%)  based on updated data; 3 treatment -related deaths were \nreported in the nivolumab/ipilimumab arm (one each: metabolic \nencephalopathy, fulminant hepatitis, and acute renal failure) .247 A phase 2 \nDutch trial ( INITIATE)  assessed nivolumab/ipilimumab as subsequent \ntherapy in patients with PM.248 Results showed a disease control rate of \n68% at 12 weeks (23/34; 95% CI, 50% –83%); 29%  (10/34) had a partial \nresponse and 38% (13/34) of patients had stable disease.248 Grade 3 \ntreatment -related adverse events were reported in 34% (12/ 35) of \npatients ; 94% (33/34) of patients had treatment -related adverse events .  \nPROMISE- meso , a multicenter phase 3 randomized trial, assessed \nsubsequent therapy with pembrolizumab versus either gemcitabine or vinorelbine in 144 patients with relapsed PM after progression on \nplatinum -based chemotherapy.\n260 There was no difference in overall \nsurvival between the groups (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.74–1.69; P = .59).  \nA phase 3 randomized trial assessed subsequent therapy with \npemetrexed plus best supportive care versus best supportive care alone in \n243 patients with PM who had progressed on systemic therapy.261 Median \noverall survival was not statistically significant between the arms (8.4 months for pemetrexed vs. 9.7 months for supportive care only; P =.74), \nprobably because patients could cross over to pemetrexed.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Pleural  \n \nMS-11 multicenter survey reported that rechallenging with a pemetrexed/platinum \nregimen reduced the risk of death when compared with rechallenging with \npemetrexed alone (HR, 0.11; P < .001).259  \nNCCN Recommendations  \nBased on these trials, the NCCN Panel recommends the following \nsubsequent therapy options for patients with PM  if not administered first \nline: 1) pemetrexed (category 1) ; or 2) nivolumab with (or without) \nipilimumab (category 2A).69,250- 253,261 The panel decided that if \nimmunotherapy was administered as first -line treatment, then combination \npemetrexed/platinum regimens are subsequent therapy options (eg, \npemetrexed plus either cisplatin or carboplatin). The NCCN Panel also \nrecommends other subsequent chemotherapy options based on clinical \ntrial data,  including  1) rechallenging with pemetrexed- based regimens if  \npatients had a good sustained response to first -line therapy; 2) \nvinorelbine; or 3) gemcitabine.240,242,259 -266 For the 2022 update (Version 1), \nthe NCCN Panel deleted pembrolizumab as a subsequent therapy option for patient with relapsed PM based on updated clinical trial data.\n260 As \npreviously mentioned, i mmune- related adverse events, such as \npneumonitis, may occur with nivolumab with (or without) ipilimumab (see \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Management of Immunotherapy -Related \nToxicities, available at www.NCCN.org ).223- 225 \nThe NCCN Panel has preference stratified the systemic therapy regimens \nand voted that the following regimens are preferred subsequent therapy \noptions for certain patients with PM who have progressed on systemic \ntherapy, including 1) pemetrexed if not given first line (category 1) ; 2) \nrechallenging with pemetrexed- based regimens if good response with \nfirst-line therapy; or 3) nivolumab with (or without) ipilimumab.69,250- 253,259,261 \nThe panel voted that the following regimens are other recommended options: 1)  vinorelbine; or 2) gemcitabine.\n260  Radiation Therapy  \nIt is very challenging to accurately and safely deliver RT to the entire \npleural surface without damaging radiosensitive sites, such as the lung \nand heart, especially when the lungs are intact.267 The Principles of \nRadiation Therapy  for PM are described in the algorithm and are \nsummarized in this Discussion. The NCCN Guidelines for Non- Small Cell \nLung Cancer are also a useful resource  (see Principles of Radiation \nTherapy ). In patients with PM, RT can be used as part of a multimodality \nregimen; however, RT alone is not recommended for treatment . RT can \nalso be used as palliative therapy for relief of chest pain, bronchial or \nesophageal obstruction,  or other symptomatic sites associated with PM, \nsuch as metastases in bone or in the brain (see the algorithm  and NCCN \nGuidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).30,155,268 The dose of radiation should be based on the \npurpose of treatment.269 The most appropriate timing of delivering RT (ie, \nafter surgical intervention, with [ or without ] chemotherapy) should be \ndiscussed with a multidisciplinary team. After EPP, adjuvant hemithoracic RT may reduce the local recurrence rate.\n270- 273 Patients are candidates for \nRT if they have good PS, pulmonary function, and kidney function (see Principles of Radiation Therapy  in the algorithm ). In patients with limited or \nno resection of disease (ie, in the setting of an intact lung), high -dose \nconventional RT to the entire hemithorax has not been shown to improve \nsurvival and is associated with significant toxicity.\n155,274  \nA phase 3 randomized trial assessed postoperative radical hemithoracic \nIMRT versus palliative RT given after lung- sparing surgery and \nchemotherapy in 108 patients with PM .275 The 2 -year overall survival rate \nwas 58% in the IMRT arm versus 28% in the palliative RT arm (HR, 0.54; \n95% CI, 0.31– 0.95; P = .031). In the IMRT arm, 11 patients had grade 3 or \ngreater acute toxicity; 17 patients had grade 3 to 4 late toxicity. One patient died.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Pleural  \n \nMS-12 chemotherapy and surgery.276 Radiation pneumonitis , which  was \nreversible with corticosteroids , was reported in 30% (95% CI, 14% –50%) \nof patients (grade 2 in 6 patients, grade 3 in 2 patients ). Most patients had \nstage III or IV PM; most evaluable patients had a partial P/D. In patients \nwith resectable tumors, 2 -year overall survival was 59%. Mediastinal nodal \nfailure occurred in 22% (6/27) of patients; distant progression occurred in 48% (13/27) of patients. Another trial assessed postoperative hemithoracic \nIMRT given after lung- sparin g surgery and cisplatin/pemetrexed in 69 \npatients with PM .\n277 Patients received either extended P/D (35) or partial \npleurectomy (34); the 2 -year overall survival was 65% and 64%, \nrespectively. Grade 2 to 3 pneumonitis occurred in 20% of patients; one patient died from pneumonitis. Based on these trials, the NCCN Panel \nrecommends that hemithoracic pleural IMRT can be considered following \ninduction chemotherapy and P/D in certain patients with PM if done in \ncenters with expertise in this technique.\n275- 277  \nIt has been controversial whether immediate (prophylactic) RT is useful for preventing instrument -tract recurrence after pleural intervention.\n278- 283 An \nolder French trial reported that  prophylactic RT was useful for preventing \nrecurrence, but 2 other trials did not find any benefit.278,282,283 A phase 3 \nrandomized trial (SMART trial) compared prophylactic radiotherapy with \ndeferred radiotherapy to assess the rate of recurrences in patients who \nhad had procedures for PM.284 Patients in the deferred RT arm did not \nreceive RT until procedure- tract metastases were evident. Data showed \nno difference in procedure- tract recurrence in the prophylactic RT arm (9% \n[9/102]) versus the deferred RT arm (16% [16/101]) (odds ratio [OR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.19– 1.32). In addition, prophylactic RT did not improve the \nquality of life, decrease chest pain, or decrease the need for analgesic drugs. However, if patients did not receive chemotherapy, prophylactic RT \ndid decrease the risk for procedure -tract metastases (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, \n0.02– 0.93; P = .021). The NCCN Panel does not routinely recommend \nprophylactic  RT to prevent instrument -tract recurrence after pleural intervention  based on the SMART trial (see Principles of Radiation \nTherapy  in the algorithm ).\n148,189,273,274,284- 287 Several prophylactic RT dose \nregimens are cited in the literature.278,282 -284  \nCT simulation –guided planning using either IMRT or conventional \nphoton/electron RT is acceptable.147,270,272,288 For treatment planning, PET \nscans can be used as indicated. The clinical target volumes should be \nreviewed with the thoracic surgeon to ensure coverage of all the volumes \nat risk. The total doses of radiation are described in the algorithm (see \nPrinciples of Radiation Therapy ). The postoperative RT doses after EPP \nare 45 to 60 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy, with a higher dose to higher risk areas. A \ndose of 60 Gy or more is recommended for  macroscopic residual tumors, \nif the doses to normal adjacent structures are limited to their tolerances (see the NCCN Guidelines for Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer, available at \nwww.NCCN.org\n).154 The volume of postoperative radiation should cover \nthe surgical bed within the thorax .148,189,273,274,286,287 The optimal dose of RT \nfor palliative purposes remains unclear.269,289 For patients with chest pain \nfrom PM, total doses of 20 to 40 Gy appear to be effective in providing \nrelief from pain .30,278,279  \nHem ithoracic pleural  IMRT allows for a more conformal high- dose RT and \nimproved coverage to the hemithorax at risk.154,155,270,271,275,276,290 -293 \nAdvanced technologies, such as image- guided RT (IGRT), may be used \nfor treatments involving IMRT  or helical tomotherapy (HT) , stereotactic  \nradiosurgery  (SRS) , or stereotactic  body  radiation therapy  (SBRT) .267,294 \nIntensity -modulated proton therapy (IMPT) may also be used.295 RT to the \ncontralateral uninvolved lung should be minimized,155,271,296 because fatal \npneumonitis may occur with IMRT if strict limits are not applied.297- 299 The \ncontralateral uninvolved mean lung dose should be kept as low as \npossible, preferably less than 8.5 Gy.300 The volume of contralateral lung \nreceiving low -dose RT (eg, 5 Gy) should be minimized.301,302 Hemithoracic \nIMRT immediately followed by EPP was assessed in 25 patients with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:47:05 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMesothelioma: Pleural  \n \nMS-13 stage III or IV PM on final pathologic review; for patients with epithelial \nsubtypes of PM, 3 -year survival reached 84%.292 However, 13 patients \nhad grade 3+ surgical complications and one patient died from treatment.  \nThe NCCN Panel does not recommend hemithoracic pleural  IMRT  after \nEPP.  \nSummary  \nThese NCCN Guidelines focus on PM, which is the most common type  of \nmesothelioma (approximately 85%).  Mesothelioma can also occur in the \nlining of other sites , such as the peritoneum  (approximately  15%) , \npericardium, and tunica vaginalis testis.6-9 The Summary of the Guidelines \nUpdates  section in the algorithm briefly describes the new changes for \n2022.  This Discussion text for PM describes the r ecommendations in the \nalgorithm  in greater detail, for example, by including the clinical trial data \nand other references that support  the NCCN Panel’s r ecommendations in \nthe algorithm . The Version 2 update reflects the addition of the updated \nDiscussion. The NCCN Pleural Mesothelioma Panel has also developed a \nguideline for peritoneal mesothelioma (see the N CCN Guidelines for \nMesothelioma : Peritoneal, available at www.NCCN.org ). \nFor the 2022 update (Version 1), the NCCN Pleural Mesothelioma Panel \ndecided that the pemetrexed/platinum with or without bevacizumab \nregimens were preferred first -line therapy options.222,226 -234 The NCCN \nPanel deleted pembrolizumab as a subsequent therapy option for patients \nwith relapsed PM based on updated clinical trial data.260 The panel also \nclarified that if immunotherapy is administered as first -line therapy then \npemetrexed combination regimens are options for subsequent therapy \n(eg, pemetrexed plus either cisplatin or carboplatin).  The panel added a \nnew section on pathology  for the 2022 update (see Principles of  \nPathologic Review in the algorithm ). \n   PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:47:05 PM.
