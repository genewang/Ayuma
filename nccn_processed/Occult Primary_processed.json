Empathetic discussion about the natural history of these types of cancer and their prognosis, and the provision of support and \ncounseling both by the primary oncology team and specialized services may help to alleviate this distress. See NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management .\nb Testing for some tumor markers such as serum CA-125, CA 19-9, and CA 15-3 may be useful in certain circumstances, but are not diagnostic and caution must be \nexercised in their interpretation. \nc  CT should be performed with contrast and MRI should be performed with and without IV contrast unless contraindicated. FDG-PET/CT is an alternative in patients with \na contraindication to contrast enhancement.\nd If available, the pathologist should be involved with the biopsy to provide rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) to confirm adequate sampling of the lesion and to perform \nspecimen triage including cell block with immediate formalin fixation, flow cytometry, and other ancillary studies as needed.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-2 Overview \nOccult primary tumors, or cancers of unknown primary (CUPs), are \nhistologically confirmed metastatic tumors whose primary site cannot be \nidentified during standard pretreatment evaluation.1,2 These \nheterogeneous tumors have a wide variety of clinical presentations and a poor prognosis in most patients. Early dissemination, aggressiveness, and \nunpredictability of metastatic pattern are characteristic of these tumors.\n3 \nMedian survival is 8 to 12 months and depends on several prognostic \nfactors that are discussed below.2 Select patients with favorable subsets of \nCUP have median overall survival (OS) in the range of 12 to 36 months.4,5 \nThese guidelines provide recommendations for evaluation, workup, \nmanagement, and follow- up of two pathologic diagnoses in patients with \nepithelial occult primary cancer:  \n• Adenocarcinoma, or carcinoma not otherwise specified  \n• Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)  \nRecommendations for neuroendocrine tumors or head and neck tumors of \nunknown primary origin can be found in the NCCN Guidelines for \nNeuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors  and the NCCN Guidelines for Head \nand Neck Cancer s, respectively.  \nThe NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) \nfor Occult Primary suggest diagnostic tests based on the location of \ndisease and histology . For SCC, the guidelines focus on the most \ncommon sites of clinical presentation, namely the head and neck nodes, \nsupraclavicular nodes, axillary nodes, inguinal nodes, and bone. For \nadenocarcinoma, 12 different clinical presentations are addressed, with \nsuggested diagnostic tests for each location. For each of the pathologic \ndiagnoses, if a primary tumor is subsequently found, treatment should be \nbased on recommendations in the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for the cancer site corresponding to the primary tumor (see the list of NCCN \nGuidelines for Treatment by Cancer Type ). \nThe management portion of the algorithm focuses on treatment of disseminated or localized disease for adenocarcinoma and site -specific \nSCC. The P anel endorses enrollment of patients in appropriate clinical \ntrials when possible. In most patients  with CUP , systemic therapy is \npalliative and does not significantly improve long -term survival. In patients \nwith disseminated disease in particular, the treatment goals are directed \ntoward symptom control and providing the best quality of life possible. \nHowever, certain clinical presentations of these tumors are associated \nwith a better prognosis.\n6 Special pathologic studies can identify subsets of \npatients with tumor types that are more responsive to systemic therapy. \nTreatment options should be individualized for this selected group of \npatients to achieve optimal response and survival rates.  \nLiterature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update \nMethodology  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines® for Occult \nPrimary (Cancer of Unknown Primary [CUP]), an electronic search of the \nPubMed database was performed to obtain key literature using the \nfollowing search terms: occult primary cancer; cancer of unknown primary; \ncarcinoma of unknown primary; and cancer of unknown origin. The \nPubMed database was chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer- reviewed biomedical \nliterature.\n7   \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; \nGuideline;  Practice Guideline;  Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-\nAnalysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-3 The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional \nsources deemed as relevant to these guidelines and discussed by the \nPanel have been included in this version of the Discussion section (eg , e-\npublications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). Recommendations for which high- level evidence is lacking are based on the P anel’s review of \nlower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nNCCN recommendations have been developed to be inclusive of \nindividuals of all sexual and gender identities to the greatest extent \npossible. When citing published studies and recommendations from other \norganizations, the terms used (eg, male , female ) reflect the cited sources.  \nThe complete details of the development and update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at www.NCCN.org\n.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.  NCCN Guidelines endeavor  to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  NCCN \nGuidelines  incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men , women , female, and male  when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender  from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the inform ation is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nEpidemiology \nCUP has an average age at diagnosis of 60 to 75  years  and accounts for \n2% to 9% of all tumors .2,8 CUP is among the 10 most frequently diagnosed \ntumors in developed countries.2,9 An estimated 34,950 cases of CUP are \nexpected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2024 , accounting for \napproximately 2% of all U.S. cancers.10 However, deaths from  CUP  are \nestimated to reach 49,240  in 2024 . This discrepancy is believed to reflect \na lack of specificity in recording the underlying cause of death on death \ncertificates and/or an undercount in the case estimate. Recently, the \nincidence of CUP diagnos es has been decreasing,  which is  likely \nattributed to improved diagnostics  and detection of primary tumors .11 \nUnfortunately, no improvement in median survival was seen over this time \nperiod.  \nA study based on an  analysis of the Swedish Family -Cancer Database \nrevealed that CUP may have a genetic basis.12 The analysis showed that \n2.8% of occult primary cases were familial (ie, a parent and offspring were both diagnosed with occult primary cancer). In addition, CUP was \nassociated with the occurrence of lung, kidney, and colorectal cancers in \nfamilies, suggesting that these tumor types are often the primary sites of \nthe disease.\n12 A latent primary cancer may emerge during the natural \ncourse of the disease, al though it is uncommon. In 20% to 50% of \npatients, the primary tumor is not identified even after postmortem \nexamination.8,13,14 Some data also suggest an epidemiologic correlation \nbetween smoking and risk of developing CUP.15 A literature review found \nstrong associations between CUP risk and smoking frequency  (>20 \ncigarettes per day) as compared to individuals who never smoked . \nIndividuals who smoked ≥40 years  also had an increased likelihood of \ndeveloping  CUP (multivariable adjusted hazard ratio [ HR], 1.45; 95% PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:23 PM.

Therefore, physicians should not rely on patterns of known metastases to determine the primary \nsite in patients with CUP. \nAbout 80%  of patients with CUP have  a poor prognosis and median OS of \n3 to 10 months.\n2,18  In general, adenocarcinomas and undifferentiated \ntumors have a worse prognosis than SCC (3.5% vs. 41.6% 3- year \nsurvival).2 Other unfavorable prognostic features include male gender  \nassigned at birth ; older age (≥65 years); poor performance status (PS); \nmultiple comorbidities; metastases involving multiple organs (eg, liver, \nlung, bone); nonpapillary malignant ascites (adenocarcinoma); peritoneal \nmetastases; multiple cerebral metastases; and adenocarcinoma with \nmultiple lung/pleural or bone lesions.2,19- 21 For these patients, an empiric \napproach to therapy is recommended, although the likelihood of survival benefit is questionable.  \nThe 20% of patients with CUP with a more favorable prognosis include \nthose with a single, small, and potentially resectable tumor; poorly \ndifferentiated carcinoma with midline nodal distribution; SCC involving \ncervical lymph nodes (constituting 2% –5% of all cases of occult primary  \ncancers\n22); isolated inguinal adenopathy (SCC); poorly differentiated \nneuroendocrine (PDNE) carcinomas; women with papillary \nadenocarcinoma of the peritoneal cavity; women with adenocarcinoma \ninvolving only axillary lymph nodes; and men with blastic bone metastases  \nand elevated prostate -specific antigen (PSA; adenocarcinoma).2,19,23,24 For \npatients with favorable prognostic features, tailored approaches to treatment, such as locoregional treatments or specific systemic therapy \nregimens (eg, fluorouracil- based therapy for suspected colon primary or \ncisplatin -based therapy for possible germ cell tumor) , are likely to provide \nclinical benefit and may prolong survival.    \nA robust prognostic model and nomogram to predict OS in patients with \nCUP was recently developed and externally validated using a large \nmulticenter cohort of 926 patients .5 Five independent prognostic factors \nwere identified:  gender  assigned at birth , Eastern Cooperative Oncology \nGroup ( ECOG ) PS, histology, number of metastatic sites , and neutrophil -\nlymphocyte ratio. Male gender  assigned at birth , poor ECOG PS, \nadenocarcinoma histology, high number of metastatic sites, and high neutrophil -lymphocyte ratio were associated with worse survival in the Cox  \nregression model. ECOG PS and neutrophil -lymphocyte ratio were the \nstrongest predictors of OS ( P < .001).  The resulting model predicted OS \nwith superior performance (concordance probability estimate [CPE] of 0.69 and concordance index of 0.71) compared with traditional prognostic \nclassifiers. This model uses universally available baseline factors to \nensure feasibility of use in diverse settings and can potentially aid in  \nclinical decision -making as well as clinical trial selection and stratification.  \nPathology  \nCUP can be classified into five major subtypes after routine evaluation \nwith light microscopy. The most frequently occurring subtype is well - or \nmoderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (60%), followed by poorly  \ndifferentiated adenocarcinoma (25%), SCC (5%), undifferentiated \ncarcinoma (5%), and neuroendocrine tumors (5%).1,2 CUP often has \nmultiple chromosomal abnormalities and overexpression of several genes, including EGFR, MET, JAK3, BRAF, PIK3CA, c- kit/PDGFR  (PDGFR α or \nPDGFRβ ), RAS, BCL2 , HER2 , and TP53 .\n9,25- 27 The BRD4 -NUT oncogene, \nresulting from the chromosomal translocation t(15;19), has been identified \nin children and young adults with carcinoma of midline structures and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:23 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-5 unclear primary sites.1,29,30 Other chromosomal abnormalities frequently \nobserved in CUP are activation of angiogenesis genes (50% –89% of CUP \ntumors), oncogene overexpression (10% –30%), epithelial -to-\nmesenchymal transition marker elevation (16%), and activation of hypoxia -\nrelated prot eins (25%) and intracellular signaling molecules (20% –35%).2 \nA study that performed targeted gene panel sequencing in a series of 252 \npatients with CUP found that the most common genetic alterations were \ndeletions in the tumor suppressor genes p53 (49.6%), CDKN2A  (19.0%) , \nand NOTCH1  (14.1%) as well as activation of the oncogenes  KRAS \n(23.4%),  FGFR4  (14.9%) , and PIK3CA (10.7%).31 Both KRAS activation \nand CDKN2A deletion were associated with poor prognosis.  Additionally, \nchromosomal instability has been suggested as a possible cause or \nprognostic factor for more aggressive presentations of CUP.2,32 \nIn an attempt to identify the tissue of origin, biopsy specimens are often \nanalyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC).33-36 Gene expression profiling \n(GEP) assays have also been developed to attempt to identify the tissue of origin in patients with occult primary cancers.\n37-39 Both methodologies \noffer a similar range of accuracy in tumor classification (approximately \n75%).40 While there may be a diagnostic benefit to GEP, a clinical benefit \nhas not been demonstrated. Consequently, the P anel does not currently \nrecommend use of gene sequencing to predict tissue of origin. Until more \nrobust outcomes and comparative effectiveness data are available, \npathologists and oncologists must collaborate on the judicious use of IHC \nand GEP  on a case- by-case basis, with the best possible individualized \npatient outcome in mind.41     \nImmunohistochemistry \nIHC studies are useful for the characterization of CUP tumors by providing \ninformation about tumor lineage, cell type, and pathologic diagnosis.33-36,42 \nThe use of IHC in CUP is based on the premise that concordance exists in \nthe expression profiles of primary and metastatic cancers.37,39 The predictive value of IHC panels improves with the recognition of patterns \nthat are strongly indicative of specific tumors. However, limitations of IHC \ntesting include factors affecting tissue antigenicity, interobserver and \nintraobserver variability in interpretation, tissue heterogeneity, and \ninadequate biopsy samples. Nevertheless, with well -performed and \ninterpreted IHC panels, pathologists can identify the putative site of origin \nof CUP in about 75% of samples ( however, validation to determine \naccur acy is a challenge given the unknown primary cancer designation).40 \nExhaustive IHC studies (in excess of 10 –12 stains) have not been shown \nto increase the diagnostic accuracy in identifying the putative primary \nsites.43 Therefore, testing a large series of IHC markers in individual \npatients should be avoided.   \nTo determine tissue of origin using IHC, a tiered approach is \nrecommended to conserve the diagnostic material. A first tier of IHC \nassays can be used to help determine tissue lineage using lineage-\nrestricted markers (eg, carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, melanoma). A \nsecond tier of IHC, using organ -specific markers, can be used to help \nsuggest the putative primary site.40 In select patients, it may be helpful to \nuse a third tier of testing for tumor biomarkers that might inform treatment \ndecisions, such as RAS , HER2, or ALK rearrangements. Per physician \ndiscretion, TRK protein testing can be considered as part of broad IHC testing (a positive test should be confirmed with next -generation \nsequencing [ NGS ]).\n44,45 IHC studies should be used in conjunction with \nimaging studies to select the best possible treatment options for patients \nwith CUP.  \nIn Situ Hybridization \nThe use of  in situ hybridization  (ISH) studies in CUP tumors is critical for \nevaluating chromosomal aberrations including translocations, insertions or inversions, deletions , and amplifications.\n46The utility of ISH in CUP is \nmultifaceted and can provide information that may  aid in the identification \nof the primary tumor or in  guiding  treatment.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-6 (ie, HER2 positivity) can help predict sensitivity to certain targeted \nagents.47 Select  chromosomal errors may help delineate solid tumors, \npotentially leading to identification of the primary site. In a study of 85 \npatient s with metastatic head and neck SCC , human papillomavirus \n(HPV) (p16) analysis via ISH was conducted as part of the clinical \nworkup.48 Of the 60 p16 -positive samples, 98% correlated with the \npresence of HPV via ISH.  In cancers of the head and neck,  p16 positivity \nis prognosticative of oropharyngeal origin ( P < .001) . Limitations to ISH \ninclude factors relating to the complexity of ISH testing, that of which is more cumbersome than IHC testing.\n49 Historically, ISH also has \ndecreased sensitivity to low -expression genes or short transcripts.  The \nemergence of new and informative IHC markers , and recent  advances in \ntesting methodologies and test sensitivity in ISH, will likely continue to  aid \nin the diagnosis of CUP.49,50 See Immunohistochemistry /In Situ \nHybridization  Markers for Unknown Primary Cancers  in the algorithm for \nsuggested IHC markers.  \nMolecular Profiling  \nRecent advances in molecular profiling techniques can potentially offer \nnew therapy options to patients with CUP; however, the clinical benefit of \nusing molecular profiling to guide treatment decisions in CUP remains to \nbe determined. There are two main applications for  molecular profiling  in \nthe management of  CUP. The first application  utilizes GEP and \nmolecular cancer classifier assays to determine the tissue of origin to \nguide site -specific therapy . The second application  utilizes NGS to \nidentify genomic  aberrations that can be targeted therapeutically.   \nGEP and Molecular Cancer Classifier Assays for Tissue of Origin  \nOver the past decade, several studies have examined various molecular \nas\nsays designed to identify the tissue of origin in CUP.39,51 These assays \nare designed based on the assumption that metastatic tumors will have a similar molecular profile to that of the primary tumor. Assays used in GEP utilize messenger RNA (mRNA)- , DNA -, or microRNA (miRNA) -based \nplatforms , which analyze anywhere between 10 and 2000 genes \nsimultaneously and can distinguish between 6 and 50 different cancer \ntypes .52-61 When compared to  samples from known tumor types, these \nassays have generally demonstrated an accuracy rate of 83% to 94% in \ndetermining the tissue of origin.62 However, because it is difficult to \nconfirm the site of origin in most cases of CUP, the accuracy of GEP assays in occult primary tumor samples is challenging to determine. \nSurrogate measures used to determine accuracy include correlation with \nIHC finding s, clinical presentation/response to therapy, as well as the \nappearance of latent disease at the primary tumor site.\n39,51 Several \nstudies suggest that the accuracy of GEP profiling is comparable or \nsuperior to the accuracy of IHC  for poorly differentiated/undifferentiated \ncarcinomas.43,62,63 \nSeveral commercially available GEP tests have been evaluated in \nprospective clinical studies  in an attempt to determine if the information \nthey provide regarding tissue of origin translates into clinically meaningful benefits for patients .\n64 Comparisons between commercially available GEP \ntests have also been published.39,41,51 Currently, there is no evidence of \nimproved outcomes with the use of site -specific therapy guided by \nmolecular testing results in patients with CUP. Results from a prospective \nphase II study of 194 patients with CUP in which treatments were based \non the identification of primary sites by a 92 -gene assay showed that \nclinical features and response to treatment were generally consistent with \nassay results.64 However, while the median survival time of 12.5 months in \nthe subset of patients who received GEP- directed treatment was better \nthan the predefined historical cohort, the difference was small and similar \nresults could be expected from empiric use of these regimens in a good \nPS group of patients with CUP predominantly below the diaphragm.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-7 treatment did not significant ly improve 1 -year survival  rates  compared with \nempirical carboplatin plus paclitaxel in patients with CUP .65 The \nrandomized phase III GEFCAPI04 trial directly compared the clinical \neffectiveness of systemic treatment based on GEP results to empiric \nchemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine in 243 European  patients \nwith CUP .66 Median progression- free survival (PFS) and OS were similar \nbetween the two groups. Although GEP -based site- specific treatment did \nnot improve outcomes, it is important to note that many patients in this trial  \nhad cancers that are difficult to treat and for which no targeted therapies \nare available (ie, pancreatico- biliary cancer ). Molecular testing in a small \nnumber of patients with suspected primary cancers unlikely to respond to \nempiric chemotherapy allowed the use of a targeted agent or better \ntailored therapy. However, there were not enough of these patients to \nimpact the overal l trial results . Thus, the clinical benefit that might be \nderived from the use of GEP assays, if any, remains to be determined.  \nMutational Testing with Next -Generation Sequencing  \nSince the identification of clinically relevant genomic alterations has the potential to influence therapy options, use of standardized comprehensive \nNGS assays may help identify novel treatment paradigms to address the \nlimited treatment options and poor prognoses of patients with CUP.\n67-70 \nThe ability  of NGS to identify potentially actionable mutations in patients \nwith CUP varies widely in the literature. Depending on the study, \nmutations with potential therapeutic relevance have been identified in 30% to 85% of patients with CUP.\n21,67,71- 75 The wide reported variation in \nthe detection of actionable mutations by NGS in patients with CUP may be attributed to the different NGS assays, gene panels, analysis tools, and \ndefinitions for what is considered an actionable mutation used across the \ndifferent studies. In a study by Ross et al, use of a hybrid- capture–based \nNGS assay enabled the identification of at least one  potentially actionable \ngenomic alteration in 85% of the 200 CUP specimens analyzed .\n67 \nHowever, only 13% of  patients had  alterations associated with U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)-approved targeted therapies.21 In an \nupdated analysis by the same group, 32% of the 303 patients with CUP \nanalyzed had actionable genomic alterations associated with FDA -\napproved targeted therapies, including alterations in programmed death  \nligand 1 ( PD-L1) expression, microsatellite instability (MSI) status , and \ntumor mutational burden (TMB) .75 Similarly, a study by Varghese et al, \nwhich  defined an actionable mutation as a specific molecular alteration \nthat is linked to a drug response by an FDA approval or other high- level \nclinical evidence, found actionable genomic alterations in 30% of patients \nwith CUP .74 Another study analyzed the mutation and copy number profile \nof 1709 CUP samples in the GENIE cohort to identify potential targeted treatment options.\n76 Fifty two significantly mutated genes were detected, in \nwhich 13 (25%) had approved (or undergoing clinical trials) targeted therapy options available.  In a large study by Kato et al, comprehensive \ngenomic profiling identified genomic alterations potentially targetable by FDA-approved agents in 63.8% of the 442 patients with CUP who were  \ntested.\n73 Using multi -platform profiling, including IHC, gene sequencing, \nand ISH, Gatalica et al identified actionable mutations in 96% of 1806 \nCUP cases.72 However, most of these were identified using established \nIHC techniques . Importantly, 4 years after the publication of this study, the \nauthors used a 592 -gene panel to profile 389 CUP cases and found that \nonly 28% were associated with therapeutically targetable mutations.77   \nTo date, there is a lack of high- level evidence to suggest that use of \ntargeted therapies based on NGS results improves outcomes in patients  \nwith CUP.  The phase II, randomized, international CUPISCO trial \nassessed the clinical benefit of NGS -directed targeted therapy  in 528 \nparticipants  by directly comparing the efficacy of empiric platinum -based \nchemotherapy with molecularly  targeted therapies relevant to the \naberrations found by genomic profiling in patients with histologically confirmed CUP.

This trial has recently closed \nand results are pending (Clinical Trial ID: NCT03498521 ).  \nInitial Evaluation \nPatients with a suspected metastatic malignancy should undergo a \ncomplete history and physical examination (including breast, genitourinary, \npelvic, rectal, skin, and/or oral cavity  examinations  as appropriate) with a \ndetailed review of past biopsies or malignancies, removed lesions, spontaneously regressing lesions, and existing imaging studies. Routine \nlaboratory tests (ie, complete blood count [ CBC] , electrolytes, liver function \ntests, creatinine, calcium ) and contrast -enhanced chest/abdom en/pelvi s \nCT sc ans with IV contrast are also recommended. Clinically  directed \nendoscopy , urinalysis [UA],  hemoccult test,  and measurement of lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH)  can be included in the initial evaluation, if indicated.  \nDiagnostic Imaging  \nImaging can play an integral role in the multidisciplinary diagnostic \nevaluation of patients with CUP.\n78 CT is the most frequently used imaging \nmodality in the management of occult primary cancers. PET scan has been shown to be useful for the diagnosis, staging, and restaging of many \nmalignancies,\n79,80 and might be warranted in some situations for CUP. \nPET scan has shown intermediate specificity and high sensitivity in a few small studies, but larger randomized studies are required to determine the \nclinical utility of PET in patients with CUP.\n4,78,81 In a comprehensive review \nof 10 published studies, Seve et al concluded that PET is a valuable imaging modality for patients with CUP with a single site of metastasis if \ntherapy with a curative intent is planned.\n82 Cumulative data from a meta-\nanalysis examining PET as a diagnostic tool in 246 patients with cervical nodal metastases of unknown primary tumors demonstrated a tumor \ndetection rate of 44% and a sensitivity and specificity rate of 97% and \n68%, respectively .\n83  One of the limitations of PET has been the limited accuracy of anatomic \nlocalization of functional abnormalities because of very little accumulation \nof 18F -fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer in some neoplastic tissues. In \nthese cases, the combination of PET with either CT or MRI can provide more useful information.\n84,85 Several studies have reported that the \ncombination of PET/CT identified the primary site in 25% to 75% of patients with CUP.\n86-94 A multicent ric diagnostic accuracy test study \nassessed the role of FDG -PET/CT in the detection of primary tumor s in \n175 patients with CUP.95 Lesions indicative of malignant p rimary tumors \nwere detected  in 60% of patients  and pathologically proven in 57.1% . \nResults also showed a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 93.3%.  In a \nprospective study of 56 patients with CUP, the sensitivity and accuracy of \nPET/CT for the detection of primary tumors were significantly higher than \nthe sensitivity and accuracy of CT/MRI (69% and 77% vs. 41% and 48%, \nrespectively; P < .04).96 PET/CT has also been shown to improve the \naccuracy of staging CUP by detecting more metastases than CT alone.97 \nAlthough one study suggested that PET/CT detected more primary sites \n(24% –40%) than conventional CT (20% –27%),98 the exact role of PET/CT \nremains undefined because of the lack of large prospective clinical trials comparing PET/CT with conventional imaging modalities. Therefore, the \nPanel recommends using FDG -PET/CT as an alternative to CT/MRI for \nthe initial evaluation only in patients with a contraindication to contrast \nenhancement . However, FDG -PET/CT may be warranted in some other \nsituations, especially when considering local or regional therapy.  \nCombined modality screening with PET/MRI has been evaluated in \nseveral studies for its diagnostic significance in CUP. In a preliminary comparison trial to evaluate the diagnostic potential of whole- body \nPET/MRI versus PET/CT, Ruhlmann et al found that both hybrid imaging \ntechniques provide a comparable diagnostic ability for detection of the \nprimary cancer site in patients with CUP.\n99 Furthermore, due to the \nsignificantly lower dose of ionizing radiation (IR), PET/MRI may serve as PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:23 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-9 an alternative to PET/CT, particularly for therapy monitoring and long- term \nsurveillance.99 In a prospective study by Sekine et al, 43 patients with \nsuspected CUP were assessed with PET/CT and PET/MRI for the \npresence of a primary tumor, lymph node metastases, and distant \nmetastases.100 PET/MRI was found to be superior to PET/CT for primary \ntumor detection (sensitivity/specificity, 85%/97% vs. 69%/73%; P  = \n.02) and comparable to PET/CT for the detection of lymph node \nmetastases (93%/100% vs. 93%/93%;  P = .157)  and distant metastases \n(100%/97% vs. 82%/100%; P = .564). PET/CT also tended to misclassify \nphysiologic uptake of FDG as malignancy compared with PET/MRI.100 \nAdvances in MRI technology have enabled the emergence of more \nsensitive and accurate techniques. Multiparametric MRI (MPMRI), which consists of three separate imaging parameters (T2- weighted imaging, \ndiffusion- weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast -enhanced imaging), \nallows for detailed visualization of tissues as well as their chemical \nmakeup, enabling experienced radiologists to better separate cancer ous \ntissue from benign tissue. In a retrospective study of 38 patients with CUP and cervical lymph node metastases, the accuracy of PET/CT and MPMRI \nin locating the primary tumor in the neck region was identical, with MPMRI \nhaving the added advantage of sparing patients the exposure to IR.\n101 T1-\nweighted high- resolution isotropic volume examination (THRIVE) is a 3D \nultrafast spoiled gradient MRI sequence that provides more detailed \nanatomic information and improved spatial resolution with reduced \nartifacts when compared to traditional 2D spin- echo MRI. In a \nretrospective study of 73 patients with CUP and cervical lymph node metastases, 3D -THRIVE MRI enabled the identification of the primary \ntumor in 72.9% of patients compared to 49.2% and 36.4%, respectively, for spin- echo MRI and contrast -enhanced CT.\n102 The diagnostic accuracy \nof 3D -THRIVE MRI (71.2%) was found to be higher than the accuracies of \nspin-echo MRI (53.4%) and CT (46.4%; P  = .001). Therefore, because of \ntheir lower IR dose levels and either identical or improved efficacy and accuracy, PET/MRI, MPMRI, and 3D -THRIVE MRI may be favorable over \nPET/CT scans in the workup of suspected occult malignancies. However, \nmore robust data from randomized prospective trials that include treatment \noutcome and patient survival data are required to support this  assertion.  \nWorkup  \nPatients with a suspected occult primary tumor should undergo an initial \ncore needle biopsy (preferred) and/or fine -needle aspiration ( FNA) with \ncell block  of the most accessible site.  Accurate pathologic assessment of \nthe biopsied material is of utmost importance. Therefore, a pathologist \nmust be consulted to determine the adequacy of the specimen and to \nperform additional studies including IHC stains  or ISH testing . If available, \nthe pathologist should provide r apid on-site evaluation (ROSE) and \nconfirm adequate sampling of the lesion.103,104 If additional biopsy material \nis necessary, a core needle, incisional, or excisional biopsy may be performed. Examination of the biopsy material by light microscopy is \nusually performed first. Other techniques include electron microscopy and \nflow cytometry. Although IHC stains can be informative (see \nImmunohistochemistry  above), large panels of IHC markers should be \navoided.  \nMSI/mismatch repair (MMR) testing is indicated for patients with CUP; \nhowever, it should be noted that the population of patients with MSI -\nhigh/MMR -deficient (MSI -H/dMMR) occult primary tumors is generally low. \nIn a comprehensive analysis of 389 CUP tumors, only 1.8% of tumors were MSI -H.\n77 Determination of TMB by a validated and/or FDA -approved \nassay is a category 2B recommendation.105 Molecular profiling of tumor \ntissue using NGS or other technique to identify gene fusions can be \nconsidered after an initial determination of histology has been made. \nTumor/somatic molecular profiling should be considered for patients who \nare candidates for anti -cancer therapy to identify uncommon mutations \n(ie, RET fusions).

The \nPanel does not recommend tissue -of-origin  studies .   \nAt this point, a specific pathologic diagnosis may be made (ie, epithelial \noccult primary [not site- specific], lymphoma or other hematologic \nmalignancy, thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma, germ cell tumor). \nOther diagnostic studies should be based on clinical presentation and \nsubsequent histopathologic findings. This initial evaluation will identify a \nprimary site in approximately 30% of patients presenting with CUP. These patients should be treated according to the appropriate NCCN Guidelines \nfor Treatment by Cancer Type (see list of \nNCCN Guidelines for Treatment \nby Cancer Type ). For the remaining patients, a great deal of controversy \nexists regarding whether an exhaustive, time- consuming, and costly \nevaluation should be conducted to search for the primary tumor beyond these initial tests, as opposed to a more directed evaluation based on the \ncomplete history and physical examination, clinical presentation, \nhistopathologic diagnosis, and metastatic sites of involvement. Suggested \ndiagnostic tests for each pathologic subtype , location, and anatomic site \n(where applicable)  are indi cated in the algorithm and are discussed below. \nAdditional studies can be important in determining whether the occult \nprimary cancer is potentially curable, or in diagnosing a possibly treatable \ndisease associated with long- term survival.  \nWorkup for Possible Breast Primary \nAdenocarcinoma with positive axillary and /or mediastinal nodes in \nindividuals with intact breast tissue (including gynecomastia) is highly \nsuggestive of a breast primary  site. Adenocarcinoma in the supraclavicular \nnodes, chest, peritoneum, retroperitoneum, liver, bone, or brain could also indicate primary breast cancer. Therefore, mammogram is indicated for \nthese patients . For patients with a non -diagnostic mammogram and \nhistopathologic evidence of breast cancer, c ontrast -enhanced MRI and/or \nultrasound of t he breast should be considered. Contrast -enhanced breast MRI (if not contraindicated) should also be considered when \nmammography is not adequate to assess the extent of the disease, \nespecially in individuals  with dense breast tissue and/or positive axillary \nnodes, or to evaluate the chest wall.\n106 Breast MRI has been shown to be \nuseful in identifying the primary site in patients with occult primary breast \ncancer and may also facilitate breast conservation in select patients  by \nallowing for lumpectomy instead of mastectomy.107,108 In one report, MRI \nidentified the breast as the primary site in approximately half of the \npatients  presenting with axillary metastases, irrespective of breast \ndensity.109   \nFor patients  with involvement of the mediastinum whose workup does not \nindicate primary breast cancer, additional consultation with a pathologist to \ndetermine whether further analysis would help differentiate between breast \nand non- small cell lung cancer (or other put ative primary sites) should be \nconsidered.  \nWorkup for Possible Testicular Germ Cell Primary  \nAdenocarcinoma with positive mediastinal nodes  in patients with testes \nwho are < 50 years suggests a possible primary testicular germ cell tumor, \nas does a retroperitoneal mass in such patients  <65 years of age. \nMeasurement of the serum tumor markers β -human chorionic \ngonadotropin ( β-hCG) and α -fetoprotein (AFP) is recommended; t esticular \nultrasound is indicated for patients found to have elevated levels of serum \nβ-hCG or  AFP. For patients who have involvement of the mediastinum  and \nwhose workup does not indicate a primary germ cell tumor, additional \nconsultation with a pathologist to determine whether further analysis would \nhelp differentiate between testicular and non- small cell lung cancer should \nbe considered.

Testing for the ovarian cancer marker CA -125 is \nrecommended in these cases, as is consultation with a gynecologic \noncologist. For patients who have involvement of the mediastinum but \nwhose workup does not indicate a primary ovarian  tumor, consider treating \nfor germ cell tumors (including poor -risk germ cell tumors) or non -small \ncell lung cancer based on the age of the individual.  \nWorkup for Possible Prostate Primary   \nAll patients with a prostate (or post -prostatectomy) who are > 40 years with \nan adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, except for those with metastases \nlimited to the liver or brain, should undergo testing for PSA levels. In addition, patients presenting with bone metastases or multiple sites of \ninvolvement should have PSA levels assessed regardless of age.  \nAdditional Workup for Localized Adenocarcinoma or Carcinoma Not \nOtherwise Specified  \nIn patients with adenocarcinoma involving painful bone lesions, a contrast -\nenhanced c hest/abdom en/pelvi s CT with bone scan is indicated.  For \npatients presenting with a retroperitoneal mass, peritoneal mass , or \nascites, urine cytology is recommended followed by cystoscopy if findings \nare suspicious. In patients with inguinal lymph node involvement, the \nguidelines include proctoscopy, if clinically indicated, to assess for rectal \nor anal cancer.\n110 Endoscopic evaluation is recommended for patients \npresenting with malignancy in the liver and is suggested for patients with positive supraclavicular nodes, if clinically indicated. However, endoscopy is not routinely recommended for patients presenting with malignant \nascites (ie, peritoneal presentation). Since the differentiation between \nmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the liver and primary hepatocellular \ncarcinoma (HCC) is sometimes challenging, the use of AFP as a marker \nfor HCC is recommended as part of the additional workup for CUP in the liver.\n111 In the absence of a positive fecal occult blood test or other clinical \nfactors suggesting a putative colon primary or concern for bowel involvement/obstruction from metastatic cancer or carcinomatosis, the \ndiagnostic yield of colonoscopy is low and is therefore not recommended \nas standard practice in the workup process of CUP .\n112  \nWorkup for S quamous Cell Carcinoma  \nSCC can be present in the lymph nodes of the head and neck region, as \nwell as in the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal nodes. Contrast -\nenhanced CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, careful perineal and lower extremity examination including reproductive organs and genitalia, \ngynec ologic oncology consult , and anal endoscopy are recommended for \npatients with SCC involving inguinal lymph nodes. PET/CT can be \nconsidered as an alternative for patients with a contraindication to contrast \nenhancement.

The workup recommendations for \nNeuroendocrine Tumors of Unknown Primary  in the NCCN Guidelines for \nNeuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors  s hould be followed for patients with \nsuspected primary neuroendocrine tumors . \nManagement  \nPsychosocial Distress  \nFor many patients, the apparent uncertainties surrounding the diagnosis of an unknown primary cancer may result in significant psychosocial distress \nand increased difficulty in accepting treatment options. A study by \nHyphantis et al found that psychiatric manifestations, including anxiety and \ndepression, were more common in patients with CUP than in those with \nknown primary cancers.\n113 Empathetic discussion about the natural histo ry \nof these types of cancers,  their prognoses, and the provision of support \nand counseling by both the primary oncology team and specialized \nservices may help alleviate this distress. Please see the NCCN Guidelines \nfor Distress Management  f or further information.  \nSupportive Care  \nIn addition to psychosocial support, patients with active and incurable CUP often require symptom management and palliative care interventions. \nGiven the natural history of this disease, end -of-life discussions should be \ninitiated early in the clinical course. Hospice care should also be considered and utilized as appropriate. Please see the \nNCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care  and the NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship  for more \ninformation.  \nTreatment Based on Workup Findings  \nAdenocarcinoma  \nLocalized adenocarcinoma or carcinoma not otherwise specified is treated \naccording to the most likely primary site. Patients with localized \nadenocarcinoma or carcinoma not otherwise specified involving \nsupraclavicular nodes or the head and neck regions should be treated \naccording to the Occult Primary pathway described in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Head and Neck Cancers . P atients  with localized \nadenocarcinoma involving axillary nodes as well as those who are breast -\nmarker positive and have pleural effusion should be treated according to the \nNCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer . Patients  with localized \nadenocarcinoma with a peritoneal mass or ascites consistent with ovarian \nhistology should be treated according to the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian \nCancer . Pati ents  with a retroperitoneal mass consistent with germ cell \nhistology should be treated according to the NCCN Guidelines for \nTesticular Cancer  or NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer , respectively .  \nLocalized adenocarcinoma occurring in the mediastinum most likely \nderives from either a germ cell tumor or a non- small cell lung tumor. \nPatients <40 years and those between 40 and 50 years should be treated \nfor poor -risk germ cell tumors according to the NCCN Guidelines for \nTesticular Cancer or the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer . \nAlternatively, patients aged 40 to 50 years could also be treated according \nto the NCCN Guidelines for Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer .

For example, axillary node dissection is recommended for \npatients with a prostate (or post -prostatectomy) with localized \nadenocarcinoma involving the axillary nodes. Additionally, radiation \ntherapy (RT) or systemic therapy can also be considered if clinically \nindicated. Patients with completely resectable lung nodules should be \nconsidered for s urgery. Systemic therapy, preferably as part of a clinical \ntrial, or stereotactic body RT (SBRT) can be considered for oligometastatic lung nodules with or without resection. Lymph node dissection is \nrecommended for inguinal nodal involvement; RT with or without systemic \ntherapy can also be considered if clinically indicated. It should be noted \nthat the use of RT alone in cases of bilateral inguinal node involvement is \na category 2B recommendation.\n114  \nSurgical resection with or without systemic therapy is recommended for \npatients with localized adenocarcinoma in the liver. If surgery is medically \ncontraindicated or declined by the patient, or if the tumor is unresectable, \nrecommended  systemic therapy and/or locoregional treatment options as \ndescribed in the NCCN Guidelines for Hepatocellular Carcinoma  should \nbe followed.  \nFor patients with good PS and bone lesions with potential for fracture in weight -bearing areas, surgery and RT are recommended. In the case of \npatients with poor PS, RT without surgery is recommended. Patients with brain metastases should be treated according to the recommendations for \ntreating metastatic lesions in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous \nSystem Cancers . S ystemic therapy (preferably within a clinical trial) can \nbe considered for patients presenting with breast marker -negative pleural \neffusion or ascites/peritoneal mass of non- ovarian origin. In the case of a \nretroperitoneal mass of non- germ cell histology, surgery and/or RT is \nrecommended, with systemic t herapy considered only for select patients. \nEfforts should be made to control symptoms in patients with disseminated \nadenocarcinoma of unknown primary. The preferred treatment approach for these patients is  enrollment in a clinical trial. Additional \nrecommendations include consideration of systemic therapy on an \nindividual basis and specialized approaches (see Specialized Approaches  \nbelow).  \nSCC \nIn patients with site -specific SCC and localized axillary or inguinal lymph \nnode involvement, lymph node dissection is recommended. RT with or \nwithout systemic therapy can be considered if clinically indicated (the use \nof RT alone in the case of bilateral inguinal node involvement is a category 2B recommendation).\n114 Systemic therapy is not recommended if the \ntumor has a high likelihood of cutaneous origin.  \nPatients with  involvement of SCC in the supraclavicular lymph nodes or in \nthe head and neck  regions  should be treated according to the \nrecommendations for occult primary tumors described in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Head and Neck Cancers . Patients with site -s pecific SCC in \nthe mediastinum should be treated according to the NCCN Guidelines for \nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer . Participation in a clinical trial is the preferred \ntreatment option for patients with multiple lung nodules or pleural effusion. \nSystemic therapy can also be considered.  \nSurgery and RT are recommended for patients with good PS and bone \nlesions with potential for fracture in weight -bearing areas . For patients with \npoor PS, RT alone is recommended. Patients with brain metastases should be treated according to the recommendations for metastatic lesions \nin the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers\n. \nEfforts should be made to control symptoms in patients with disseminated \nSCC of unknown primary .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-14 Neuroendocrine Tumors  \nTreatment of suspected neuroendocrine tumors should follow the \nNeuroendocrine Unknown Primary pathway of the NCCN Guidelines for \nNeuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors . \nSystemic Therapy  \nMany systemic therap y regimens have been evaluated in patients with \nCUP in an attempt to  prolong survival and provide symptom relief. Various \nregimens have shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with CUP in \nphase II studies. However, a 2012 systematic review of chemotherapy \ntrials in patients with CUP of unfavorable presentations concluded that no \nspecific regimen can be recommended as standard of care.115 Historically, \nresponse rates of around 20% and median OS of 6 months have been observed in patients with CUP treated with taxane - or platinum -based \nregimens.\n116,117 A systematic review and meta -analysis published in 2013 \nlargely reached  the same conclusion, with taxanes showing a possible \nslight advantage over platinum -based regimens.118 In general, systemic \ntherapy shows limited efficacy and considerable toxicity in patients with \nCUP. Therefore, these guidelines recommend that systemic therapy for \npatients with disseminated disease be limited to patients who are symptomatic with a PS of 1 –2 or to patients who are asymptomatic with \naggressive cancer and a PS of 0. The choice of regimen should be based on the histologic type of cancer. Regimens in addition to those listed in the \nguidelines can be considered. \nAdenocarcinoma  \nPoorly differentiated or undifferentiated occult primary tumors respond \ndifferently from well- to moderately differentiated occult primary tumors. \nTumors in the former group seem to be highly responsive to cisplatin -based combination chemotherapy.\n119,120 ORRs  reported in two \nstudies from the early 1990s were 53% (van der Gaast et al120) and 63% (Hainsworth et al119) with complete response rates of 12% and 26%, \nrespectively, with cisplatin -based regimens. In one study, patients who \nhad tumors with extragonadal germ cell features showed an especially high response rate.\n119 In the other, patients with undifferentiated \ncarcinomas had a better response rate than those with poorly \ndifferentiated carcinomas (79% vs. 35%; P  = .02).120 Taxane- based \nchemotherapy has also been associated with long- term survival in some \npatients with CUP, with 1 -, 2-, 3-, and 4 -year survival rates of 42%, 22%, \n17%, and 17%, respectively, and a median survival of 10 months.121  \nThe following regimens are included in the algorithm for treating \nadenocarcinoma of unknown primary based on the results of phase II \nand/or phase III studies, as described below. Regimens other than those \nlisted can also be considered.  It is important to note that leucovorin is \nindicated with certain fluorouracil -based regimens. However, depending \non availability, these regimens may be used with or without leucovorin. For \nmore information regarding the leucovorin shortage, see below.   \nPaclitaxel and Carboplatin with or without Etoposide \nThe combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin is commonly used to treat \nnon-small cell lung  and esophageal cancers.122- 128 The combination of \npaclitaxel and carboplatin (with or without etoposide) was found to be effective for the treatment of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary in \nseveral studies.\n121,129- 133 In the  phase II  Hellenic Cooperative Oncology \nGroup study, the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin was well \ntolerated and produced an ORR of 38.7%.129 In a randomized prospective \nphase II study conducted by the German CUP Study Group, paclitaxel and carboplatin showed better clinical activity than gemcitabine and \nvinorelbine.\n133 The median OS, 1 -year survival rate, and response rate \nwere 11.0 months, 38%, and 23.8%, respectively, for patients treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin, compared with 7.0 months, 29%, and 20%, \nrespectively, for those treated with gemcitabine and vinorelbine.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-15 III randomized trial found paclitaxel, carboplatin, and etoposide to be an \neffective  regimen in the first -line treatment of patients with CUP.132 The \nORR was 18% among 93 patients; median PFS and OS were 3.3 months \nand 7.4 months, respectively ; and the 2- year survival rate was 15%. In a \nphase II trial with  long- term follow- up, patients treated with paclitaxel, \ncarboplatin, and etoposide had 2- and 3- year survival rates of 20% and \n14%, respectively.130 However, overall toxicity  is higher  with the addition of \netoposide than that typically observed with paclitaxel and carboplatin. \nTherefore, paclitaxel and carboplatin is a preferred regimen for the \ntreatment of occult primary adenocarcinoma while the combination of \npaclitaxel, carboplatin, and etoposide should be reserved for patients with \na PS of 0 to 1 on the ECOG scale. \nGemcitabine and Cisplatin or Docetaxel   \nThe combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin is commonly used to treat non-small cell lung cancer and bladder cancer.\n124,125,134 -137 The efficacy of \ncombined gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of CUP w as \nevaluated in the randomized phase II GEFCAPI 01 study.138 Well-\ndifferentiated adenocarcinoma was the most common histology, with one-fourth of patients having a single metastatic site. Objective responses \nwere observed in 55% of patients (n = 21) receiving gemcitabine and \ncisplatin and the median survival was 8 months . The follow- up GEFCAPI \n02 trial randomly assigned 52 patients 1:1 to receive gemcitabine and \ncisplatin or cisplatin alone.\n139 Median OS and 1 -year survival rates w ere \n11 months and 46% for the gemcitabine and cisplatin arm compared to 8 \nmonths and 35% for cisplatin alone. Median PFS was 5 months in the \ngemcitabine and cisplatin arm and 3 months in the cisplatin arm; 1 -year \nPFS rates were 29% and 15%, respectively.  \nGemcitabine and docetaxel was also found to be active and well -tolerated  \nas first -line therapy in patients with CUP.140 Of 35 patients, 1 complete \nresponse and 13 partial responses were observed with an ORR of 40%. The median time to disease progression was 2 months and the median \nOS was 10 months. Based on these data, the Panel recommends \ngemcitabine and cisplatin ( preferred ) and gemcitabine and docetaxel as  \ntreatment options for patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary.  \nCapecitabine with  Oxaliplatin (CapeOx) and Fluorouracil/Leucovorin with \nOxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6)  \nThe combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOx) has been evaluated in phase II studies for first -line\n141 and second- line142 treatment of \npatients with CUP. As an active and well -tolerated regimen, CapeOx is a \npreferred option in patients with presumed GI primary adenocarcinoma. A  \nphase II trial involving 51 patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, first- line treatment with CapeOx resulted in an ORR  of 11.7%, \nmedian PFS of 2.5 months, OS of 7.5 months , and a favorable toxicity \nprofile.\n141 Second- line treatment with CapeOx  resulted in an ORR of 19%, \nmedian PFS of 3.7 months , and OS of 9.7 months  in a phase II trial of 48 \npatients with CUP, the majority of whom (65%)  had adenocarcinoma of \nunknown primary .142  \nAlthough fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) has not been  \nprospectively evaluated in patients with CUP, FOLFOX has been shown to be equivalent to CapeOx in the treatment of colorectal cancer.\n143- 147 The \nPanel therefore recommends  FOLFOX (mFOLFOX6 regimen148) as a \npreferred  treatment option for  patients with presumed GI primary \nadenocarcinoma.   \nFluorouracil/Leucovorin and Irinotecan (FOLFIRI)  \nThe combination of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) is commonly used in the first - and second -line treatment of gastrointestinal  \n(GI) cancers.\n149- 154 The landmark phase III French Intergroup trial, which \ncompared first -line treatment with FOLFIRI to epirubicin, cisplatin, and \nfluorouracil (ECF) in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:23 PM.

Second -line \ntherapy with FOLFIRI has also been shown to be active and well -\ntolerated in patients with metastatic gastric cancer, recurrent or \nadvanced biliary trac t cancer, and locally advanced or metastatic \npancreatic cancer.\n151,153   \nData for the efficacy of FOLFIRI in the treatment of patients with CUP \nare limited. A retrospective study identified 32 patients with CUP \npredicted to have a colorectal site of origin by molecular profiling who were treated with colorectal cancer regimens, including FOLFIRI.\n155 \nResults showed significantly improved ORRs in patients treated with site -\nspecific regimens such as FOLFIRI compared to empirical regimens \nused to treat CUP (50% vs. 17%; P = .0257). Since a colorectal primary \nsite is among the most common primary sites in CUP ,156,157 the Panel \nrecommends FOLFIRI as a preferred treatment  option for first - or \nsecond -line therapy in patients with  presumed GI  CUP.  \nDocetaxel and Carboplatin or Cisplatin  \nGreco et al reported that docetaxel in combination with either cisplatin or carboplatin was active in patients with adenocarcinoma and poorly   \ndifferentiated CUP .\n158 Major response to therapy was observed in 26% of \npatients receiving docetaxel and cisplatin, with a median survival of 8 months and a 1 -year survival rate of 42%. In patients receiving docetaxel \nand carboplatin, the corresponding response rate was 22%, with a median survival of 8 months and a 1- year survival rate of 29%. Docetaxel in \ncombination with carboplatin was better tolerated than docetaxel with cisplatin in this study.\n158  In a phase II  Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group study, treatment with \ndocetaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks was found to be as safe and effective as  palliative treatment for patients with adenocarcinoma or poorly \ndifferentiated CUP  with a PS of 0 to 2.\n159 Median time to progression was \n5.5 months  and OS was 16.2 months. Combination therapy with docetaxel \nand cisplatin was examined in a cohort of 29 patients with CUP.160 \nApproximately half of these patients (51.7%) had well - to moderately \ndifferentiated adenocarcinoma; patients with undifferentiated carcinoma (27.6%) and SCC histologies (13.8%) were also included. The ORR was \n37.9%, and median PFS and OS were 6 and 16 months, respectively. Therefore, docetaxel in combination with either cisplatin or carboplatin are \nrecommended treatment options for patients with adenocarcinoma of \nunknown primary.  \nIrinotecan and Carboplatin or Gemcitabine  \nThe combination of irinotecan and carboplatin was evaluated in a phase II \nstudy of 45 chemotherapy -naïve patients with CUP. The regimen was \nassociated with an ORR of 41.9%; median PFS was 4.8 months and OS was 12.2 months. The 1- and 2 -year survival rates were 44% and 27%, \nrespectively. However, this regimen was also associated with significant \ntoxicities, including grade 3 or higher  leukopenia (21%), neutropenia \n(33%), anemia (25%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).\n161 A phase III \nrandomized trial found irinotecan and gemcitabine to be an effective \nregimen in the first -line treatment of patients with CUP, with a  response \nrate and 2- year survival rate of  18% each. Median PFS and OS were 5.3 \nmonths and 8.5 months, respectively.132 The Panel recommends \nirinotecan and carboplatin as a  treatment  option for occult primary \nadenocarcinoma; irinotecan and gemcitabine should be reserved for \npatients who are ineligible to receive platinum -based chemotherapy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-17 Capecitabine  or Fluorouracil  \nCapecitabine and fluorouracil are commonly used as single agents in the \ntreatment of GI cancers.162- 165 A trial conducted by the National Surgical \nAdjuvant Breast and Bowel Project  reported that treatment with \nfluorouracil  significantly improved disease- free survival  (DFS)  and OS in \npatients with stage II or III colon cancer.164 In this trial, 1081 patients were \nrandomized to receive fluorouracil or lomustine, vincristine, and \nfluorouracil (MOF). Three- year DFS was 73% in the fluorouracil group \ncompared to 64% in patients receiving MOF ( P = .003). Additionally, \npatients treated with fluorouracil had a 30% reduction in treatment failure and a 32% reduction in mortality risk compared to patients treated with \nMOF after 3 years of follow -up. In a phase III randomized trial involving \n1987 patients with metastatic colon cancer, adjuvant  treatment with single -\nagent capecitabine improved relapse -free survival (HR, 0 .86; 95% CI, \n0.74–0 .99; P = .04) and was associated with significantly fewer adverse \nevents than fluorouracil ( P < .001).\n162 Therefore, single- agent capecitabine \nand single- agent fluorouracil are recommended options for the treatment \nof occult primary adenocarcinoma. Single -agent capecitabine or \nfluorouracil can be given with concurrent RT, if clinically indicated.  \nFluorouracil/Leucovorin, Irinotecan, and Oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX)  and \nmFOLFIRINOX  \nThe FOLFIRINOX  regimen is commonly used in the treatment of \npancreatic cancer.166- 170 The landmark  phase III  PRODIGE  trial, which  \nrandomized 342 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and good PS \nto receive FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine, found that treatment with \nFOLFIRINOX resulted in dramatic improvements in median OS (11.1 vs. \n6.8 months ; P < .001), median PFS (6.4 vs. 3.3 months ; P < .001) , and \nORR (31.6% vs. 9.4 %; P < .001) compared to treatment with \ngemcitabine.166 In a systematic review and meta- analysis that included \n315 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer across 11 studies, treatment with FOLFIRINOX showed a pooled median OS of 24.2 months, which is longer than that typically observed with gemcitabine (6 –\n13 months).\n169 However, FOLFIRINOX has been associated with \nsignificant toxicities , including grade 3– 4 febrile neutropenia, \nthrombocytopenia, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue , and sensory \nneuropathy.166,169 Additionally,  there is a lack of data regarding the \nefficacy of FOLFIRINOX in  the treatment of  CUP. Therefore, \nFOLFIRINOX should be reserved for patients with a PS of 0– 1 and a \npresumed GI primary site.   \nThe mFOLFIRINOX  regimen has  also shown efficacy in the treatment of \npancreatic adenocarcinoma.  In a multicenter phase III  trial, 493 patients \nwith resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were randomized to \nreceive mFOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine.171 At a median follow -up of 34 \nmonths, the median DFS was 22 months in the mFOLFIRINOX group and 13 months in the gemcitabine group ( P < .001). The median OS was \n54 months with mFOLFIRINOX compared to 35 months with gemcitabine (P = .003). The 3 -year OS rate was 63% in the modified -FOLFIRINOX \ngroup and 49% in the gemcitabine group. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 76% of patients receiving mFOLFIRINOX compared to  53% \nof those receiving gemcitabine.  Due to significant toxicity  and a lack of \ndata regardi ng the efficacy of mFOLFIRINOX in the treatment of CUP , \nmFOLFIRINOX should be reserved for patients with a PS of 0– 1 and a \npresumed GI primary site.  \nPembrolizumab  \nPembroli zumab, an anti -programmed cell death  protein 1 (PD-1) antibody, \nwas approved by the FDA in 2017 for the treatment of patients with \nunresectable or metastatic MSI -H/dMMR  solid tumors that have \nprogressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.\n172 This first -ever tissue- and site- agnostic \napproval was based on data from 149 patients with MSI -H/dMMR cancers PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:23 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-18 (90 patients had colorectal cancer) enrolled across five  multicenter single-\narm clinical trials. One of the trials included in the FDA approval was \nKEYNOTE- 016, a phase II trial that evaluated the activity of \npembrolizumab in 41 patients with metastatic treatment -refractory dMMR \ncolorectal cancer, MMR -proficient colorectal cancer, or dMMR non -\ncolorect al cancer who had received at least two previous lines of \ntherapy.173,174 The immune- related ORR for patients with dMMR colorectal \ncancers was 40 % with an immune -related PFS rate of 78 %.173 Responses \nof patients with dMMR noncolorectal cancer s were  similar. Importantly, the \nimmune- related ORR and PFS rate were 0% and 11%, respectively, in \npatients with MMR -proficient colorectal cancer. In a n expansion of this \nstudy, data from 86 patients with dMMR tumors representing 12 different \ncancer types achieved an ORR of 53% with 21% of patients achieving a \ncomplete response  to pembrolizumab .174 In the phase II KEYNOTE -158 \ntrial, 233 patients with 27 different  MSI-H/dMMR  tumor types (endometrial, \ngastric, cholangiosarcoma, and pancreatic cancers being the most \ncommon) were treated with pembrolizumab following the failure of at least one previous line of therapy.\n175 After a median follow -up of 13 months, the \nORR was 34.3%. Median PFS was 4 months and median OS was 24 \nmonths. Treatment -related adverse events occurred in 64.8% of patients \n(14.6% were grade 3–5).                  \nIn 2020, the FDA approved pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients \nwith metastatic TMB -high (TMB -H) [≥10  mutations/megabase (mut/Mb)] \nsolid tumors, as determined by an FDA -approved test, that have \nprogressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.\n176 This approval was based on a \nretrospective analysis of 102 patients enrolled in the KEYNOTE- 158 trial  \nwho had tumors identified as TMB -H.177 The ORR for these patients was \n29%, with a 4% complete response rate and 25% partial response rate. The median duration of response was not reached, with 50% of patients \nhaving response durations for ≥24 months. Based on these data, pembrolizumab may be used to treat patients with MSI -H/dMMR  or TMB -H \n(≥10 mut/Mb) occult primary  tumors .  \nDostarlimab -gxly \nDostarlimab -gx ly, an anti -PD-1 antibody, was approved by the FDA in \n2021 for the treatment of patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced solid \ntumors that have progressed on or following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.\n178 This approval was based \non data from the nonrandomized phase 1 multi -cohort GARNET trial that \nevaluated the safety and antitumor activity  of dostarlimab- gxly in  209 \npatients with dMMR solid tumors.179,180 The majority of patients had \nendometrial or GI  cancer s. The ORR was 42 %, with  a 9% complete \nresponse rate and 33 % partial response rate , and the m edian duration of \nresponse was 3 5 months.  The m ost common treatment -related adverse \nevents were fatigue, anemia, diarrhea, and nausea. Immune- mediated \nadverse events  also occurred, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, \nendocrinopathies, nephritis , and dermatologic toxicities . Based on these \ndata, dostarlimab- gxly may be used to treat patients with MSI -H/dMMR \noccult primary adenocarcinoma tumors.  \nSelpercatinib  \nSelpercatinib, a R ET kinase inhibitor, was approved by the FDA in 2022 \nfor the treatment of advanced or metastatic RET gene fusion- positive \nsolid tumors  that have progressed on or following prior systemic \ntreatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options .181   \nThis approval was based on data from the ongoing international  phase \nI/II LIBRETTO -001 trial, which evaluated the dose escalation and dose \nexpansion of selpercatinib in patients with RET gene fusion -positive \ntumors (other than non -small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer) .182 The \nORR was 44% in the 41 evaluable patients who received the recommended  starting dose of 160 mg  twice daily.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-19 related adverse events occurred in 40% of 45 patients.  The most \ncommon grade 3 or higher treatment -related adverse events were \nhypertension (22%), increased alanine aminotransferase (16%), and \nincreased aspartate aminotransferase (13%). Based on these data, \nselpercatinib may be used to treat  patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic solid tumors that progressed on or following prior systemic \ntreatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment  options.  \nDabrafenib and Trametinib \nDabrafenib, a BRAF  V 600E -directed tyrosine kinase inhibitor  (TKI) , used \nin combination with trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, was approved by the FDA \nin 2022 for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E \nmutated solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.\n183 The open- label, \nsingle -arm EAY131 -H study evaluated the  efficacy  of dabrafenib and \ntrametinib in solid tumors  with BRAF V600 mutations (excluding those with \nmelanoma, thyroid or colorectal cancer, and non- small cell lung cancer).184 \nOf the 29 patients included in the primary efficacy analysis, ORR was 38% \n(90% CI, 22.9% –54.9%) with  P < .0001 against a null rate of 5%, and PFS \nwas 11.4 months (90% CI, 8.4– 16.3 months) . Average OS was 28.6 \nmonths. Based on these data, the P anel recommends dabrafenib and \ntrametinib as a treatment option for patients with BRAF V600E mutated \nsolid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory treatment options.  \nEntrectinib, Larotrectinib , and Repotrectinib  \nEntrectinib and larotrectinib ( T RK-directed TKIs), and repotrectinib (a next -\ngeneration ROS1 and TRK-directed TKI) , are used as single agents in \npatients with NTRK gene fusion- positive tumo rs without a known acquired \nresistance mutation, that are metastatic or where surgical r esection is \nlikely to  result in severe morbidity, and that have no satisfactory alternative treatments or  that have progressed following treatment.  A pooled analysis \nof three clinical trials (two phase 1 trials [ ALKA- 372–001 and STARTR K-1] \nand one phase 2 trial [STARTRK- 2]) evaluated the activity of entrectinib in \n54 patients aged ≥18 years  with NTRK  gene fusion- positive solid tumors.45 \nThirty one participants  (57%; 95% CI 43 .2–70.8]) had an objective \nresponse, of which 4 (7%) and 27 (50%) had a complete response and \npartial response, respectively. The average duration of response was 10 \nmonths. To evaluate the efficacy of larotrectinib on NTRK  gene fusion-\npositive  solid tumors , 55 patients were enrolled in one of three protocols:  a \nphase 1 study involving adults, a phase 1– 2 study involving children, or a \nphase 2 study involving adolescents and adults .44 ORR was 75% (95% CI, \n61–85) at the primary data cutoff date. Seven (13%) patients  had a \ncomplete response, 34 (62%) had a partial response, and 7 (13%) had \nstable disease. At 1 year, 71% of participants continued to have a \nresponse and 55% remained progression free. The ongoing phase I/II \nTRIDENT -1 trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of  repotrectinib in TKI -\nnaïve and TKI -pretreated ROS1  and NTRK gene fusion- positive  locally \nadvanced or metastatic  solid tumors.185 Of the total participants in the \nstudy ( TKI-naïve: n = 40; TKI -pretreated: n = 48), one (n  =1) had CUP  in \nthe TKI -pretreated cohort . The primary endpoint of TRIDENT -1 was \nconfirmed ORR and results showed an ORR of 50% (95% CI, 35- 65) in \nthe TKI -pretreated cohort  (Clinical Trial ID: NCT03093116). \nFam-Trastuzumab Deruxtecan- nxki \nFam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd) , an antibody drug conjugate, \nwas approved by the FDA in 2024 for patients with HER2 -positive (IHC \n3+) advanced or metastatic solid tumors that progressed on or  following \nprior systemic treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative \ntreatment options.186 An open- label phase II study evaluated the efficacy \nof T-DXd in 267 patients (of which n = 5 had CUP) with HER2 -expressing \n(IHC 3+/2+) locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who had received \n≥1 systemic t reatment or without alternative treatment  options.187 Results PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:23 PM.

Based on these data, the P anel recommends  T-DXd as a \nuseful in certain circumstances treatment option for patients with HER2-\npositive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who meet the criteria consistent with the \nFDA indication.  \nSquamous Cell Carcinoma  \nPlatinum -based regimens have typically been used to treat disseminated \nSCC. Historically, the combination of cisplatin and fluorouracil has been the most frequently used regimen for patients with SCC of unknown \nprimary.\n188,189 Overall, only a few small studies have evaluated the efficacy \nof systemic therapy regimens in patients with SCC occult primary tumors. \nTherefore, the P anel lists possible regimens based on evidence from \nstudies of patients with SCC of known primaries and small studies of patients with SCC of occult primaries. Regimens other than those listed \ncan also be considered.  \nPaclitaxel and Carboplatin \nIn the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group phase II study of paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with CUP (discussed above for \nadenocarcinoma), three  patients had tumors of SCC histology.\n129 These \npatients had a response rate  of 30% and a median response duration of 3 \nmonths. The Panel recommends paclitaxel and carboplatin as a preferred \ntreatment option for patients with occult primary SCC.  \nmFOLFOX6 \nFOLFOX is used to treat SCC of the esophagus and stomach.190,191 The \nPanel lists mFOLFOX6 as a preferred treatment option for occult primary \nSCC based on the evidence discussed above for adenocarcinoma.147,148  Gemcitabine and Cisplatin  \nThe GEFCAPI 02 trial compared cisplatin to cisplatin plus gemcitabine in 52 patients with CUP.\n139 Although the trial was terminated early due to \npoor accrual, there was a trend towards better OS with the addition of gemcitabine (11 vs. 8 months, with overlapping CIs). \nCapecitabine or Fluorouracil  \nAs previously stated, capecitabine and fluorouracil are commonly used \nas single agents in the treatment of GI cancers.162-165 The Panel lists \nsingle -agent capecitabine and single- agent fluorouracil as treatment \noptions  for occult primary SCC  based on the evidence discussed above \nfor adenocarcinoma.  Single -agent capecitabine or fluorouracil can be \ngiven with concurrent RT, if clinically indicated.  \nPaclitaxel and Cisplatin  \nThe combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin is commonly used to treat \nesophageal, head and neck, and non -small cell lung cancers.125,192- 195 \nThis regimen has also been assessed in a phase II study of 37 patients with unfavorable presentations of CUP.\n196 The ORR was 42% (95% CI, \n23%– 61%), median time to disease progression was 4 months (95% CI, \n1.3–6.8), and the median OS was 11 months (95% CI, 8.3– 13.5). Three \nof the 37 patients had SCC.  \nDocetaxel and Carboplatin or Cisplatin  \nThe combination of docetaxel and carboplatin  was assessed in a phase \nII trial of 47 patients with  CUP.159 Twenty -four patients had favorable risk \ndisease  (defined as predominantly nodal disease or non -mucinous \nperitoneal carcinomatosis) and 23 had unfavorable risk disease (visceral \nmetastases).

Two \npatients in this study had tumors of SCC histology  and both had a partial \nresponse to the docetaxel/cisplatin regimen. Combination therapy with docetaxel and cisplatin  was also examined in a cohort of 29 patients with \nCUP, four of whom had tumo rs of SCC histology.\n160 The ORR was \n37.9%, and median PFS and OS were 6 months and 16 months, \nrespectively.  \nCisplatin and Fluorouracil  \nThis regimen has historically been used in the treatment of metastatic \nanal, head and neck , and esophageal SCC.194,198- 202 Cisplatin and \nfluorouracil  has been retrospectively evaluated in patients with SCC of \nunknown primary.188,189 Kusaba et al reported a response rate of 54.5% , \nmedian time to progression of 3 months , and a median OS of 10 months  \nin a retrospective analysis  of 11 patients with CUP  who had received this \nregimen .203 Combined cisplatin and fluorouracil can be given with \nconcurrent RT, if clinically indicated.  \nDocetaxel, Cisplatin, and Fluorouracil  (DCF)  \nThe combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil is commonly \nused to treat gastric, esophageal, and head and neck cancers.204- 207 In a \nrandomized trial of 213  patients with advanced SCC of the head and \nneck, patients received cisplatin and fluorouracil (with or  without \ndocetaxel) followed by RT.204 The ORRs were 80% and 59.2% in the 3 -drug and 2 -drug arms, respectively  (P = .002) . A similar trial involving \n501 patients with advanced head and neck SCC reported ORRs of 72% \nand 64%, respectively, for patients treated with DCF or cisplatin and \nfluorouracil alone.205 However, DCF has been associated with significant \ntoxicities, including grade 4 febrile neutropenia, and should therefore be reserved for patients with a PS of 0 to 1 .   \nPembrolizumab  \nThe Panel recommends pembrolizumab for dMMR/MSI -H or TMB -H (≥10 \nmut/Mb) occult primary SCC tumors based on the evidence discussed \nabove for adenocarcinoma.175,177 \nSelpercatinib  \nThe Panel recommends selpercatinib for patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic solid SCC occult primary tumors that progressed on or following prior systemic treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative \ntreatment options based on the evidence discussed above for \nadenocarcinoma.\n182  \nNeuroendocrine Tumors  \nNeuroendocrine CUPs are uncommon, constituting approximately 12% \nto 22% of all diagnosed neuroendocrine tumors, and their clinical \nbehavior is dependent on the tumor grade and level of differentiation.\n208,209 Neuroendocrine tumors, regardless of grade, \nrepresent a favorable prognostic subset of CUPs that are responsive to \ncombination chemotherapy, making long -term survival a possibility in \nsome patients.208  \nHainsworth et al evalu ated the efficacy of paclitaxel, carboplatin , and \netoposide in patients with metastatic  PDNE carcinomas who had \nreceived no prior treatment.210 Of these patients, 62% had PDNE of \nunknown primary .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-22 with a median survival of 14.5 months and 2- and 3- year survival rates of \n33% and 24%, respectively. The results of this trial showed that PDNE \ncarcinomas are chemosensitive, with a high ORR to combination \nchemotherapy.  \nIn another study, the combination of cisplatin and etoposide produced significant responses in patients with poorly differentiated, rapidly \nprogressing neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids and pancreatic \nneuroendocrine tumors of known primaries) when used as a second - or \nthird-line treatment.\n211 In two small series of patients, temozolomide, as a \nsingle agent or in combination with thalidomide, was also found to be \neffective in the treatment of advanced or metastatic neuroendocrine \ntumors.212,213 \nPDNE tumors can also be treated with small cell lung cancer regimens. \nIn a randomized phase III trial (JCOG 9702), the combination of \ncarboplatin plus etoposide was equally as effective as cisplatin plus \netoposide in older  patients with small cell lung cancer or those with poor -\nrisk disease who were not previously treated.214 No significant \ndifferences were seen in response rate (73% for both regimens) and \nmedian OS (10.6 months for carboplatin and etoposide vs. 9.9 months \nfor cisplatin  and etoposide).  \nThe Panel recommends that poorly differentiated (high- grade or \nanaplastic) or small cell subtype (other than lung ) neuroendocrine tumors \nbe treated following the NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung  Cancer . \nWell- differentiated neuroendocrine tumors should be treated as carcinoid \ntumors in the NCCN Guidelines for Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors . \nLeucovorin Shortage  \nLeucovorin is indicated with certain fluorouracil -based regimens. However, \nthere is currently a shortage of leucovorin in the United States.172 There \nare no specific data to guide management under these circumstances, and all proposed strategies are empiric. One is the use of levoleucovorin, which is commonly used in Europe. A levoleucovorin dose of 200 mg/m\n2 is \nequivalent to 400 mg/m2 of standard leucovorin. Another option is to use \nlower doses of leucovorin in all patients, since lower doses are likely to be \nas efficacious as higher doses based on several studies in patients with \ncolorectal cancer.215- 217 However, there are insufficient  high- quality data to \nsupport either approach. Therefore, the Panel recommends use of these \nregimens without leucovorin in situations where leucovorin is not available.  \nRadiation Therapy  \nRT is a treatment option for a variety of localized tumors, particularly as \nfollow- up treatment after lymph node dissection. Adjuvant RT may be \nappropriate if the disease is limited to a single nodal site with extranodal extension, or in the case of inadequate nodal dissection with multiple \npositive nodes. Definitive RT can be considered for patients with localized \ndisease. RT alone may also be considered for bone lesions, a \nretroperitoneal mass  with non-germ cell histology, or supraclavicular nodal \ninvolve ment in site -specific SCC. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy \n(SABR) may be used for limited (1–3) metastases or pulmonary \nmetastases.\n218,219 In the palliative setting, hypofractionated RT can be \nconsidered for symptomatic patients with uncontrolled pain, impending pathologic fracture, or impending spinal cord compression.  \nA study by Janssen et al examined individualized intensity -modulated RT \n(IMRT) with risk -adapted planning treatment volumes in 28 patients with \nCUP and cervical nodal metastases.\n220 The majority of patients (71%) \nreceived concomitant systemic therapy. In this cohort, 3 -year OS, \nmucosal control, neck control, and distant metastasis -free survival rates \nwere 76%, 100%, 93%, and 88%, respectively. No patient experienced a \nlocoregional recurrence and no grade 2 or higher adverse events were \nreported . Another retrospective study evaluated the utility of IMRT in 260 \npatients with CUP metastatic to the neck.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nOccult Primary  \n \nMS-23 control, and distant metastases -free survival rates were 84%, 91%, and \n94%, respectively.221 However, 7% of patients were diagnosed with \nchronic radiation -associated dysphagia. A third retrospective study \nassessed RT in 68 patients with metastatic head and neck SCC of \nunknown primary.222 These patients underwent oropharynx -targeted RT \nto spare the mucosal surfaces of the nasopharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx; 40% of patients received IMRT and 56% of patients received \nconcurrent chemoradiation, resulting in an actuarial locoregional control  \nrate of 95.5% and a median time to locoregional recurrence of 18 months. RT -associated toxicities included grade 1 xerostomia, \ndysphagia, neck stiffness, and trismus. The results of these studies are promising; however, large randomized prospective trials  are needed to \nfurther assess the efficacy and safety of IMRT- based treatment \napproaches for CUP.  \nLocoregional Therapeutic Options  \nIn patients with unresectable localized liver lesions, locoregional \ntherapeutic options may be considered when clinically indicated based on \ntumor size, pathology, and clinical presentation. Recommendations for \nlocoregional treatment options are described in the \nNCCN Guidelines for \nHepatocellular Carcinoma . \nSpecialized Approaches  \nSpecialized approaches are suggested for all patients with disseminated \nmetastases. The term emphasizes the importance of individualized \ntreatment plans. Specialized approaches may include palliative care \noptions (such as thoracentesis and paracentesis), targeted therapies, \nand/or novel approaches to RT.  The importance of distress management \nis also discussed in the algorithm and included as a specialized approac h. \nFor many patients the apparent uncertainties surrounding the diagnosis of \nan unknown primary cancer may result in significant psychosocial distress and increased  difficulty in accepting treatment options. Empathetic \ndiscussion about the natural history of these types of cancer and their prognosis, and the provision of support and  counseling both by the \nprimary oncology team and specialized services may help to alleviate this distress.  For additional information on addressing psychosocial distress, \nsee the NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management\n. \nFollow -up \nFollow- up frequency should be determined by clinical need in patients with \nactive disease or localized disease in remission. Follow -up consists of a \nhistory and physical examination, with diagnostic tests for patients who are symptomatic. \nFor patients with active and incurable disease, psychosocial support, \nsymptom management, end- of-life discussions, palliative care \ninterventions, and hospice care should all be considered and used as appropriate (see Psychosocial Distress  and Supportive Care above). \nPlease see the NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management , the \nNCCN \nGuidelines for Palliative Care , and the  NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship  \nfor more information.
