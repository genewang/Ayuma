Treatment for adults with WT is \nsimilar to treatment for pediatric patients; thus, referral or partnership with a pediatric oncologist familiar with the treatment of WT  is recommended.\n• Clinical presentation, bullet 6 modified: WT is associated with genetic predisposing conditions in 10% to 15% of cases, with some reports suggesting \n>30% of cases, such as Denys-Drash syndrome (male pseudohermaphroditism and glomerulopathy); WAGR syndrome (WT, aniridia, genitourinary \nabnormalities, and range of intellectual disability);  and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (macroglossia, hemihyperplasia, gigantism, and umbilical \nhernia) ; Perlman syndrome; Frasier syndrome; Sotos syndrome; Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome; Bloom syndrome; Li-Fraumeni syndrome; and \ntrisomy 18. See WILMS-I (2 of 5).\nINTRO-2\n• Treatment, bullet 8 modified: Recommend referral to infertility risk/fertility preservation counseling for patients treated with chemotherapy; strongly \nencourage prior to treatment with regimen M, regimen I, revised regimen UH-1, revised regimen UH-2,  or whole abdominal irradiation (WAI).\nWILMS-2\n• Footnote g added: Limited data exist for patients with unilateral multifocal tumors; thus, the NCCN Panel recommends that either approach is \nreasonable.\n• Footnote f modified: \"Conditions that predispose to the development of WT  include genetic disorders such as Denys-Drash , WAGR, Beckwith-\nWiedemann , Frasier, and Perlman syndromes; contralateral nephrogenic rests in children <12 months. Ten percent to 33% of WT occurs in children \nwith predisposing conditions...\" (Also for WILMS-11)\nWILMS-3\n• Footnote s modified: A retrospective analysis of the biology suggests patients with VLR FHWT and 11p15 LOH or LOI may not be suitable for reduction \nof therapy (observation without adjuvant chemotherapy). Deintensification strategy may not be suitable for patients with any adverse biomarker \n(including 1q gain or combined LOH at 1p and 16q).\n• Footnote u modified: Radiation therapy (RT) to the primary site is often given 10 to 14 days after surgery. We recognize the concern for overlapping \nfields if the abdomen and lung are treated at different times and recommend planning for possible abdominal and lung fields with initial abdominal \nRT planning, even if lung RT ultimately not given, to avoid potential of  minimize the degree of  overlapping fields. Some degree of overlap between \nthe fields is expected in order to cover the target. Local stage III refers to staging of the primary tumor regardless of metastases.

Five-year survival for these patients is >90% with appropriate treatment. However , outcome of some groups, particularly those with diffuse \nanaplastic WT (DAWT), remains poor.\n\u0017Incidence of WT is highest among African American children, followed by white children, and children of Asian descent have the lowest incidence.1 More \nthan 75% of WT present between 1–5 years (most commonly 3 years).2\n• Most patients have a solitary tumor at presentation. However, 5%–13% have bilateral tumors, and 10% have multifocal tumors in a single kidney.3-6\n\u0017For unilateral tumors, the median age at diagnosis is 35 months for males, and 42 months for females.1\n\u0017For bilateral tumors, the median age at diagnosis is 23 months for males, and 28.5 months for females.1\nClinical Presentation\n• Most patients present with abdominal distention and/or presence of an abdominal mass (83%) with or without abdominal pain (37%), fever (23%), hematuria \n(21%–25%), and hypertension (20%–25%). Less common symptoms include: varicocele, hernia, enlarged testicle, congestive heart failure, hypoglycemia, \nCushing syndrome, pleural effusion, and acute abdomen.\n• A healthy-appearing child with an abdominal mass is more likely to have WT, whereas a child with neuroblastoma tends to be ill-appearing at presentation.\n• Calcification of the tumor appears in approximately 5%–10% of WTs, versus approximately 60%–70% of neuroblastomas.\n• Almost 10% of patients with WT have coagulopathy (acquired von Willebrand disease).7-9 \n• Most common sites of hematogenous metastases include: lung (81%), lung and liver (15%), and other (4%).10 Spread to regional lymph nodes (LNs) also \noccurs.\n• WT is associated with genetic predisposing conditions in 10% to 15% of cases, with some reports suggesting >30% of cases, such as Denys-Drash \nsyndrome (male pseudohermaphroditism and glomerulopathy); WAGR syndrome (WT, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and range of intellectual \ndisability); Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (macroglossia, hemihyperplasia, gigantism, and umbilical hernia); Perlman syndrome; Frasier syndrome; \nSotos syndrome; Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome; Bloom syndrome; Li-Fraumeni syndrome; and trisomy 18. See WILMS-I (2 of 5) .11-15\n• Aniridia is present in 1% of children with WT, and hemihyperplasia appears in 2%–3% of patients with WT.15-17\n• Genitourinary malformations (ie, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, fused [horseshoe] kidneys) are found in 5% of patients with WT.17,18\n• If a predisposing condition is present, routine screening for WT is recommended with physical exam (PE) and renal ultrasound (US) every 3 months until 7 \nyears of age (ie, all of year 6).19,20\n• Compared with children with unilateral disease, children with multifocal/bilateral disease present at a younger age and are often identified as part of a \nsurveillance program for patients with a predisposing condition.19,20INTRODUCTION TO WILMS TUMOR\nINTRO-1All patients with suspected Wilms tumor (WT) should receive comprehensive care by a multidisciplinary team with experience in managing renal tumors led \nby a pediatric oncologist. \nNCCN recommendations have been developed to be inclusive of individuals of all sexual and gender identities to the greatest extent possible. On this page, \nthe terms male and female refer to sex assigned at birth.WT is largely a disease of children, though adults may occasionally present with high-risk disease. Treatment for adults with WT is similar to treatment for \npediatric patients; thus, referral or partnership with a pediatric oncologist familar with the treatment of WT is recommended.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

Second opinion consultations and referral to tertiary care centers should \nbe considered for complex surgeries.\n• Imaging studies, pathology, and tumor genetic testing results that are used to determine stage and risk group should be performed in consultation with \nexperienced specialists.\n• Consulting a radiation oncologist is recommended at time of suspected or confirmed diagnosis of WT.\n• Studies of long-term survivors show these therapies are effective; however , judicious use of available therapies is necessary to maximize cure while \nminimizing long-term toxicities.  \n• Appropriate assignment of therapy to balance these goals employs an evolving system of risk stratification. \n• Referral for cancer predisposition consultation is recommended when available for all patients with WT and strongly encouraged for patients with \nmultifocal or bilateral WT.21\n• Recommend referral to infertility risk/fertility preservation counseling for patients treated with chemotherapy; strongly encourage prior to treatment with \nregimen M, regimen I, revised regimen UH-1, revised regimen UH-2, or whole abdominal irradiation (WAI).22-24PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

Ultimately tumor staging remains surgical, but as \ntherapies continue to evolve, preoperative imaging evaluation is \nbecoming more important for staging.1,2\nGoals of Imaging\n• Differentiate primary renal tumors from primary extra-renal tumors.\n• Evaluate the involved and contralateral kidney. \n• Assess for the presence of two kidneys and determine the location \nof the tumor (renal fossa vs. ectopic).\n• Define extent of tumor in preparation for resection and RT.\n• Assess patency of the renal vein and IVC. Assess for tumor \nthrombus extending through the renal vein and IVC (can occur in \n10% of cases), and determine extent of thrombus in the IVC and/or \nrenal vein, if present.\n• Evaluate abdomen and lungs for presence of metastatic spread.\n• Provide surveillance in high-risk populations and following \ntherapy. \nImaging: US\n• First-line modality for the assessment of abdominal masses in the \npediatric population given the lack of radiation and the ability to \nperform the US without sedation. \n• Allows determination of origin of abdominal mass from the kidney \ngiven that renal masses typically distort the renal parenchyma with \na “claw sign” surrounding the mass. \n• Identifies contralateral kidney, liver evaluation, and presence or \nabsence of tumor extension into the renal vein or IVC. \na https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/americancoldf5f-acrorgf92a-productioncb02-3650/media/ACR/Files/Clinical/Contrast-Manual/ACR-Manual-on-Contrast-Media.pdf\n1 Chung EM, Graeber AR, Conran RM.

J Clin Oncol 2018;36:3396-3403.Imaging: CT/MRI\n• Abdomen CT or MRI is recommended after US to better evaluate the \noverall extent and involvement of the renal mass.3 However, both \nmodalities may require some level of sedation, especially MRI, and \nshould be performed after an initial assessment with US. \n• Pelvis CT or MRI may also be performed if the mass is assumed to \nextend to the pelvis. \n• Abdomen CT and MRI have been shown to be equivalent in the initial \nassessment of WT.4  \n• If abdomen CT is performed, portal venous phase timing is \nrecommended and multiphase imaging is not required.5\n• Prior to CT and MRI scan, renal function should be assessed by \ndetermining an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR).a\n• CT or MRI imaging of the abdomen and pelvis should assess for:\n\u0017Volume of tumor\n\u0017Evidence of tumor rupture\n\u0017Evidence of tumor thrombus extension into the renal vein or IVC\n\u0017Symmetric excretion of contrast\n• CT of the chest is also recommended to assess for pulmonary \nmetastases. If concerned with mediastinal/thoracic hilar involvement, \ncontrast may be helpful. While CT and MRI are equivalent for the \nabdomen, chest CT is superior to chest MRI for evaluation of lung \nmetastases. Perform chest CT prior to anesthesia to avoid atelectasis. \nPost-Treatment Surveillance6,7\n• Chest and abdominal imaging every 3 months for 2 years, then every \n6 months for 2 years\n• Chest x-ray and abdominal US may be used in place of cross-\nsectional imaging with chest CT and abdomen CT or MRIPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

They have evenly distributed coarse \nchromatin, small nucleoli, and are mitotically active. Blastemal-predominant tumors (66% of tumor) are aggressive, invasive, and present \nwith advanced stage, but are responsive to chemotherapy. \n• Cells that are differentiated towards epithelial and stromal lineages\n\u0017Epithelial cells are arranged in early tubular forms resembling primitive, rosette-like structures, which mimic tubular and glomerular \nelements. Epithelial lineage-predominant tumors are associated with a low risk of progression or recurrence after treatment, but frequently \nhave a poor response to chemotherapy.\n\u0017Stromal patterns include: \n ◊Smooth muscle and fibroblastic differentiation\n ◊Spindle cells in a myxoid background\n ◊Skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, ganglion cells, and neuroglial tissue with heterologous stromal differentiation\n• Completely necrotic cells\n• The most characteristic pattern is the triphasic pattern, in which blastema, epithelial, and stromal lineages are all present. However , biphasic \nand monophasic patterns also exist, and heterologous non-renal elements also occur. The tumor corresponds to stages of normal/abnormal \nnephrogenesis.\n• An additional important microscopic characteristic of WT is the presence of a peritumoral fibrous capsule that demarcates the tumor from \nadjacent renal parenchyma.\n• Chemotherapy-induced changes include necrosis, foamy macrophages, hemosiderin deposits, and fibrosis. Chemotherapy induces \nmaturation of blastemal, epithelial, and stromal components with striated muscle differentiation being the most common. At times there is an \nexcellent response to chemotherapy and the tumor is totally necrotic.1PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGY\nWILMS-C\n1 OF 21 Vujanić GM, Parsons LN, D'Hooghe E, et al.

Further , tumor \nbiopsy will automatically upstage the local stage to III, which in turn mandates additional cardiotoxic chemotherapy (doxorubicin) and RT \n(for treatment of those with unilateral tumor without a predisposing condition ). \n• The only situation in which  a pre-treatment biopsy is recommended is when the tumor is deemed unresectable in patients with a unilateral \ntumor without a predisposing condition. If a biopsy is thus considered, there are two possible options: 1) an open posterior approach—done \nto avoid intra-abdominal spill; or 2) percutaneous core needle biopsies (fine-needle aspirates are not recommended). In both instances, \nsufficient tissue must be obtained so that all necessary tests may be performed. Identification of anaplasia may be difficult by either biopsy \ntechnique.\n• If surgical exploration is performed with intent to resect but the tumor is deemed unresectable, then open biopsy should be performed.

Risk stratification is used to assign the most appropriate therapy to patients, with a goal of maximizing good outcome while \nbalancing risk of toxicity of therapies. Risk stratification has evolved through multiple large collaborative clinical trials. Current risk stratification \nincludes consideration of tumor histology, histopathologic and surgical stage, tumor biology (LOH of 1p and 16q), presence of metastatic or \nbilateral disease, and clinical factors such as patient age, known predisposing conditions, and response of pulmonary lesions to initial therapy . \nAdditional tumor biomarkers have been associated with increased risk of relapse (LOH and LOI of 1p and 16q, 1q gain), but alteration of therapy \nhas not yet been studied.\n• Cytogenetic and molecular testing are recommended for all newly diagnosed FHWT to assess for unfavorable biomarkers, including chromosome \n1q gain and/or LOH in chromosomes 1p and 16q.1,2 There are fewer data for using 11p15 LOH or LOI as unfavorable biomarkers. There are no data \nfor using chromosome 17p13 to direct therapy. Results from molecular testing can be obtained in 2 weeks.\n• Initial risk is based on age, clinical, radiographic, surgical, and pathologic findings.\n• Final risk is based on initial risk plus LOH at 1p and 16q, and response of lung metastases at week 6.INITIAL AND FINAL RISK ASSESSMENT FOR FHWT\nWILMS-F1 Gratias EJ, Dome JS, Jennings LJ, et al.

Dactinomycin and doxorubicin can be \nadministered at full doses prior to the start of radiation.\n• Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered for unresectable tumors or tumors for which NSS is indicated (see Principles of Surgery \n[WILMS-D]) to reduce the size of the tumor(s).\n\u0017Re-image after 6 weeks of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to determine whether the tumor(s) is/are resectable.\n\u0017The postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy regimen is determined by tumor histology , stage, and molecular markers.\nChemotherapy Regimens\n• EE4A: 13 doses of vincristine and 7 doses of dactinomycin administered over 18 weeks.7,8\n• DD4A: 15 doses of vincristine, 5 doses of dactinomycin, and 4 doses of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 150 mg/m2) administered over 24 \nweeks with alternating doses of dactinomycin and doxorubicin.1,2\n• VAD: 6–12 doses of vincristine, 2–4 doses of dactinomycin, and 2–4 doses of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 70–140 mg/m2) administered \nover 6–12 weeks used only in the neoadjuvant setting for patients who are candidates for NSS. In this regimen dactinomycin and \ndoxorubicin are given together.9\n• Regimen M: 9 doses of vincristine, 5 doses of dactinomycin, 5 doses of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 150 mg/m2), 4 cycles of 5 daily \ndoses of cyclophosphamide (cumulative dose 8,800 mg/m2), and 4 cycles of 5 daily doses of etoposide over 24 weeks. Dactinomycin and \ndoxorubicin are given together, and cyclophosphamide and etoposide are given together. This regimen starts at week 7 for tumors requiring \naugmentation of therapy based on molecular markers or response of lung metastases to 6 weeks of DD4A.10,11\n• Regimen I: 9 doses of vincristine, 4 doses of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 180 mg/m2), 7 cycles of 3 or 5 daily doses of cyclophosphamide \n(cumulative dose 11,880 mg/m2), and 3 cycles of 5 daily doses of etoposide. Doxorubicin and 3 daily doses of cyclophosphamide are given \ntogether, and 5 daily doses of cyclophosphamide and etoposide are given together. This regimen starts at week 7 for tumors requiring \naugmentation of therapy based on histology.9,11,12\n• Revised Regimen UH-1: 15 doses of vincristine, 5 doses of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 225 mg/m2), 5 single doses of cyclophosphamide \n(total cumulative dose 14,800 mg/m2), 5 cycles of 4 doses of cyclophosphamide, 5 doses of carboplatin, and 5 cycles of 4 doses of etoposide \nfor stage IV WT with focal anaplasia.13\n• Revised Regimen UH-2: 19 doses of vincristine, 5 doses of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 225 mg/m2), 5 doses of cyclophosphamide \n(total cumulative dose 14,800 mg/m2), 5 cycles of 4 daily doses of cyclophosphamide, 5 doses of carboplatin, 5 cycles of 4 daily doses of \netoposide, and 2 cycles of 5 daily doses of irinotecan. This regimen is used for stage II–IV WT with diffuse anaplasia.13\nContinued\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion\nChemotherapy Toxicity\n• The types of acute and long-term toxicities and the severity of the toxicities from the treatment regimens used for WT previously described \nare dependent on the number and types of anticancer drugs included in the regimen. More intensive regimens with more drugs are used to \ntreat tumors in higher risk groups. The greater risk of toxicities from these regimens is balanced by a lower risk of relapse. T reatment for \nrelapse is intensive with drugs that have increased acute and late toxicities; survival after relapse remains unsatisfactory.\n• Doxorubicin—which is included in Regimens DD4A, VAD, M, I, and UH-2—can cause myocardial damage, correlated to the cumulative dose \nof the drug. Although the cumulative dose of doxorubicin on these regimens is 150 to 250 mg/m2, younger children, especially children \nassigned female at birth, are more susceptible to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. An echocardiogram to assess cardiac function should be \nperformed prior to the first dose of doxorubicin and then prior to exceeding a cumulative dose of 200 mg/m2 and at the end of treatment to \nmonitor cardiac function.\n• Cyclophosphamide and etoposide—which are included in Regimens M, I, and Revised Regimen UH-2—increase the risk of acute toxicities, \nsuch as myelosuppression, and of long-term effects, including infertility and secondary cancers later in life. The cumulative dose of \ncyclophosphamide is lower in Regimen M (8.8 g/m2) than in Regimen I (11.88 g/m2). The cumulative dose of etoposide is ≤2 g/m2 in Regimens \nM and I. Cumulative doses >4 g/m2 cyclophosphamide equivalent dose are associated with a risk of oligospermia and azoospermia.14-16\n• The UH-1 and UH-2 Regimens used to treat anaplastic WT are the most toxic regimens used to treat WT. Several toxicity-related deaths \noccurred in patients treated with UH-1, but there were no toxic deaths on the revised UH-2 Regimen.17\n• 0.8% of patients experience severe hepatopathy, including sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, which presents with abdominal distension, \nascites, hepatomegaly, elevated transaminases, and bilirubin and thrombocytopenia. Severe hepatopathy occurred most often after a \ncourse of vincristine and dactinomycin, but radiation to the liver also contributes to this level of hepatopathy. Treatment could be safety \nreintroduced in the vast majority of patients after recovery.18\nDose Modifications\n• Infants do not tolerate chemotherapy drugs that have been dosed based on body surface area (BSA). Dosing based on body weight rather \nthan BSA using the 30-Rule (BSA dose divided by 30 and multiplied by the body weight) is better tolerated. Recently, a uniform method of \ninfant dosing of chemotherapy drugs was devised and implemented using BSA-banded infant dosing tables for patients with a BSA <0.6 \nm2.19\n• For 6 weeks after WLI or WAI, the doses of dactinomycin and doxorubicin should be reduced by 50% to ameliorate radiation recall reactions.\nSupportive Care\n• The addition of dexrazoxane can be considered for all children receiving doxorubicin. If the planned cumulative dose of doxorubicin will \nexceed 150 mg/m2, dexrazoxane should be administered prior to each dose of doxorubicin to ameliorate cardiotoxicity. Dexrazoxane dosing \nis given as a 10:1 dose ratio of dexrazoxane:doxorubicin.\n• Colony-stimulating factors (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim)a are not necessary after doses of myelosuppressive agents in Regimens EE4A, \nDD4A, and VAD, but should be considered for cycles of cyclophosphamide and etoposide, and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine \nand cycles of cyclophosphamide, carboplatin, and etoposide in Regimen M; Regimen I; Revised Regimen UH-1; and Revised Regimen UH-2.PRINCIPLES OF CHEMOTHERAPYa\nWILMS-G\n2 OF 4ReferencesContinued a An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

A later radiation \nstart is linked to increased risk of abdominal recurrence in some studies.1-3 \n• Consider patient factors when deciding about the timing of RT (eg, age of patient, need to assess response of lung metastases to \nchemotherapy), when giving whole abdomen and whole lung RT. \nFlank Radiation\n• Indicationsa,b: Discussion with the surgeon about at-risk areas is necessary for all patients and particularly in the setting of intraoperative \nspillage, whether focal or diffuse (as determined by the surgeon). If focal spill is confirmed to be localized and contained within a flank field, \nthen flank RT is recommended. See ST-1 for staging criteria. Local stage III refers to staging at the primary tumor regardless of metastases.\n• Target volume: Contour the preoperative tumor on presentation imaging (either CT or MRI). Add a 1-cm clinical target volume (CTV) \nexpansion while respecting anatomical barriers. If this target would create a dose gradient along the vertebral body , contour the adjacent \nvertebral bodies. Add a 5- to 10-mm planning target volume (PTV) margin. \n• Flank + para-aortic nodal volume: Traditional para-aortic fields include the entire chain from the crus of the diaphragm to the bottom of L5. \nCTV should include all enlarged nodes on preoperative imaging. Add a 5- to 10-mm PTV margin.\n\u0017Indication: If LNs are positive, an additional boost is given to unresected nodes.\n• Delivery of RT has traditionally been done with 3D conformal photons, although IMRT and proton therapy are options at experienced \ncenters. Shielding of the contralateral kidney should be considered in the flank area. Boost modality should be more conformal with three-\ndimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), or protons.\n• Testicular shielding should be used for most males.\n \nWhole Abdominal Irradiation (WAI)\n• Indicationsa,b: Discussion with the surgeon about at-risk areas is necessary for all patients and particularly in the setting of both \nintraoperative spillage (whether focal or diffuse) and preoperative rupture (as determined by the surgeon). If preoperative rupture has \noccurred, then WAI is recommended. See ST-1 for staging criteria.\n• Target volume: The CTV shall encompass the entire peritoneal cavity that includes the dome of the diaphragm superiorly and extends \ninferiorly to the pelvic diaphragm. A four-dimensional (4D)-CT should be used to determine diaphragm motion. Final PTV expansion should \nbe similar to the traditional field borders listed below.\n• Traditional field borders:\n\u0017Superior: 1 cm above dome of diaphragm\n\u0017Inferior: Bottom of obturator foramen (femoral heads should be blocked)\n\u0017Lateral: 1 cm beyond lateral abdominal walls\nContinueda Recommend fertility counseling for female patients receiving flank RT and/or WAI, which may cause impairment of fertility.\nb For patients with unilateral renal tumor with predisposing conditions or bilateral renal tumors, a local stage III due to biopsy only may not need R T.NCCN recommendations have been developed to be inclusive of individuals of all sexual and gender identities to the greatest extent possible.

Treatment technique: Conformal techniques \nare preferred (3D-CRT, IMRT, or protons). \n• Target volume: 3D imaging data should be acquired with the patient in the treatment position to define a gross tumor volume (GTV), CTV, \nPTV, and critical structures. 4D imaging should be considered.\n\u0017GTV is the postoperative residual tumor and should be based on imaging performed for treatment planning and postoperative diagnostic \nCT/MRI. \n\u0017CTV will be an anatomically confined margin of 0.5 cm surrounding the GTV . \n\u0017PTV will be a geometrically expanded margin surrounding the CTV. The PTV margin will be chosen by the local institution, ranging from \n0.5–1 cm. \n \nWhole Lung Irradiation  (WLI)\n• Indications: WLI is recommended in patients with lung metastases and other extra-thoracic metastases (such as liver, bone, or brain), LN \nmetastases in the hilum and/or mediastinum, or cytology-positive pleural effusion regardless of response to chemotherapy .\n  WLI can be delayed to week 6 in select patients with FHWT who only have metastases in the lungs and do not have 1q gain or combined LOH \nat 1p and 16q. WLI can be omitted if there is a CR to chemotherapy and the tumor did not have 1q gain or combined LOH at 1p and 16q. \n• Target volume: The CTV is the entire pleural surface of lung on CT simulation. Add a 5- to 10-mm PTV.\n• Technique:\n\u0017 Anteroposterior/posteroanterior (AP/PA), IMRT,4-6 or protons.7\n\u0017 If possible, 4D imaging for motion assessment with creation of internal target volume (ITV) is recommended.\n• If treating, or potentially treating, whole lung and abdomen/flank, consider planning the entire treatment up front. \nWILMS-H\n2 OF 5PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY (CONTINUED)\nContinued\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

WT1 codes a transcription factor \ncrucial for normal kidney/genitourinary function (5%–10% of cases).7-16\n\u0017WT2, a tumor suppressor gene found on chromosome 11p15, is also implicated in the development of WT.\n• Additional genes recurrently mutated in the germline of patients with WT include:4,6,17,18 \n\u0017REST, TRIM28, FBXW7, NYNRIN, KDM3B, XPO5, and DICER1\n• Congenital malformations\n\u0017Aniridia\n\u0017Cryptorchidism\n\u0017Hemihyperplasia\n\u0017Horseshoe kidney (patients are twice as likely to develop WT)\n\u0017Hypospadias\n\u0017Renal duplication\n\u0017Renal ectopia\n\u0017Renal hypoplasia\n\u0017Ureteral duplication\n• Surveillance recommendations for WT predisposing  conditions  (WILMS-I 2 of 5  and WILMS-I 3 of 5 )16,19\n\u0017The Pediatric Cancer Working Group of the American Association for Cancer Research recommends renal US every 3 months until 7 years \n(ie, all of year 6).\nFamilial WT (Nephroblastoma)\n• FWT1/FWT2  (familial WT) gene mutations account for about 1%–2% of WT cases. These mutations are autosomal dominant (AD) with \nvariable penetrance. They have no association with the WT1 mutation. FWT1 is found on chromosome 17q, whereas FWT2 is found on \nchromosome 19q.20-23\nReferencesContinued• Principles of Cancer Risk Assessment and Counseling: See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, \nPancreatic, and Prostate (EVAL-A)\n• Pedigree: First-, Second-, and Third-Degree Relatives of Proband: See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, \nOvarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate (EVAL-B)\n• Genetic testing should be considered for all patients with WT; however, the highest risk of underlying cancer predisposition is in individuals \nwith bilateral and/or multifocal, early-onset (age <2 years), and/or familial WT as well as patients with multiple nephrogenic rests or clinical \nfeatures of WT predisposing conditions.1-3 Consider germline testing for patients with physical findings consistent with predisposing \nconditions. In settings where counseling and testing for all children is not available, decision-support algorithms such as the MIPOGG tool \ncan be used to prioritize children for genetic testing.4,5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

The NCCN \nGuidelines for Survivorship defines cancer survivorship starting “from the time of diagnosis, through the balance of life.” See NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship. \n• There are two important facts about the survivorship plan for patients after they complete treatment: 1) every patient needs a plan; and 2) the plan \nneeds to be tailored to each patient based on their cancer, cancer treatment, age of treatment, and other comorbidities.\n• Being knowledgeable about the potential late effects, discussing these with patients and caregivers, and creating a survivorship plan for \nmonitoring and screening is in the purview of the treating oncology team. \n• It is outside the scope of the NCCN Guidelines for Wilms Tumor to comprehensively discuss all the potential late effects that a patient with WT \nmight experience, but we have provided some general statements about late effects that patients with WT might face (these are organized by \npotential exposure).

RADIATION\n• A traditional whole abdominal radiation field for WT includes both \nabdominal radiation (top of diaphragm to iliac crest) AND pelvis \nradiation. \n• Most flank radiation fields do not extend beyond the iliac crest; \nhowever, depending on the size of the tumor, the field may extend \ninto the pelvis. If the hemi-abdominal field extends below the iliac \ncrest, exposure to pelvic fields should be considered in assessing risk \nfor late effects. Additionally, hemi-abdominal fields will be unilateral \n(medial border along contralateral vertebral bodies) and must be \nconsidered in assessing risk for late effects. \n• Abdominal radiation\n\u0017Potential late effects: Cardiac toxicity, functional asplenia, \nesophageal stricture, impaired glucose metabolism/diabetes mellitus, \ndyslipidemia, hepatic toxicity, cholelithiasis, bowel obstruction, \nchronic enterocolitis, fistula, strictures, colorectal cancer, and renal \ntoxicity\n• Pelvic radiation\n\u0017Potential late effects: Urinary tract toxicity, bladder malignancy, \novarian hormone deficiencies, diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), \ninfertility, uterine vascular insufficiency, and vaginal fibrosis/\nstenosis1,2,3\n• Lung radiation\n\u0017Potential late effects: Subclavian artery disease, breast cancer, \nbreast tissue hypoplasia, pulmonary toxicity, lung cancer, and \ncardiac toxicity. There is potential for synergistic (increased) late \neffects in patients who are exposed to both alkylators and irradiation.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

The renal capsule is intact. The tumor was not ruptured or biopsied prior to \nremoval. The vessels of the renal sinus are not involved. There is no evidence of tumor at or beyond the margins of resection. \nNote: For a tumor to qualify for certain therapeutic protocols as Stage I, regional lymph nodes must be examined microscopically.\nStage II The tumor is completely resected and there is no evidence of tumor at or beyond the margins of resection. The tumor extends \nbeyond kidney, as is evidenced by any one of the following criteria: \n• There is regional extension of the tumor (ie, penetration of the renal capsule, or extensive invasion of the soft tissue of the renal \nsinus, as discussed below). \n• Blood vessels within the nephrectomy specimen outside the renal parenchyma, including those of the renal sinus, contain \ntumor. \nNote: Rupture or spillage confined to the flank, including biopsy of the tumor, is no longer included in Stage II and is now \nincluded in Stage III.\nStage III Residual nonhematogenous tumor present following surgery, and confined to abdomen. Any one of the following may occur: \n• Lymph nodes within the abdomen or pelvis are involved by tumor. (Lymph node involvement in the thorax, or other extra-\nabdominal sites is a criterion for stage IV.)\n• The tumor has penetrated through the peritoneal surface.\n• Tumor implants are found on the peritoneal surface.\n• Gross or microscopic tumor remains postoperatively (eg, tumor cells are found at the margin of surgical resection on \nmicroscopic examination).\n• The tumor is not completely resectable because of local infiltration into vital structures.\n• Tumor spillage occurring either before or during surgery.\n• The tumor was biopsied (whether tru-cut, open or fine needle aspiration) before removal.\n• Tumor is removed in greater than one piece (eg, tumor cells are found in a separately excised adrenal gland; a tumor thrombus \nwithin the renal vein is removed separately from the nephrectomy specimen). \nNote: Extension of the primary tumor within vena cava into thoracic vena cava and heart is considered Stage III, rather than Stage \nIV even though outside the abdomen. \nStage IV Hematogenous metastases (eg, lung, liver, bone, brain), or lymph node metastases outside the abdominopelvic region are \npresent. (The presence of tumor within the adrenal gland is not interpreted as metastasis and staging depends on all other \nstaging parameters present).\nStage V Bilateral renal involvement by tumor is present at diagnosis. An attempt should be made to stage each side according to the \nabove criteria on the basis of the extent of disease.\nST-11 Adapted from Wilms Tumor and Other Childhood Kidney Tumors Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nWilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma)  \n \nMS-2 Overview \nWilms tumor (WT, also known as nephroblastoma)  is the most common \nprimary kidney tumor in children. In the United States, approximately 650 \nchildren are diagnosed with WT each year.1 WT accounts for >90% of \nprimary kidney tumors in patients < 20 years and for 5% of all childhood \ncancers. Most children (75%) present with WT between 1 and 5 years of \nage, most commonly at 3 years.1,2 The incidence of WT is highest among \nAfrican American children, followed by w hite children, and then Asian \nchildren.3-6 WT can generally be separated  into two histology types: \nfavorable histology (FHWT) and anaplastic histology , with a majority of \npatients having favorable histology . These histologic  features direct \ntherapy  with a naplas tic tumors hav ing been shown to be more resistant to \nthe chemotherapy regimens used to treat FHWT.7,8 Five-year survival is \n>90% for children with all stages of FHWT who receive appropriate \ntreatment , but survival remains poor for children with higher stage diffuse \nanaplastic WT .7,9-13 Additionally, bilater al tumors  or multifocal tumors in a \nsingle kidney  can occur in approximately 5 % to 13 % of patients  and 10% \nof patients, respectively , and tend to be more  prevalent  in individuals with \ngenetic predisposition syndromes.14 For unilateral tumors, the median age \nat diagnosis is 35 months for males and 42 months for females , while the \nmedian age at diagnosis is 23 months for males and 28.5 months for \nfemales  for bilateral tumors .3  \nThe NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines (NCCN Guidelines®) for Wilms \nTumor (Nephroblastoma)  were first published in 2021 and recently were \nupdated to include recommendations for anaplastic tumors  along with \nFHWT . These guidelines outline therapeutic measures for these \nconditions that should be closely followed to maximize the potential for \ncure and to avoid unnecessary side effects, complications, and late toxicities.   Guidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines® are available at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines® for Wilms Tumor \n(Nephroblastoma) , an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain ke y literature in Wilms Tumor  since the previous \nGuidelines update, using the following search term s: Wilms tumor  and \nnephroblastoma.  The PubMed database was chosen as it remains the \nmost widely used resource for medical literature and indexes \npeer-reviewed biomedical literature.  \nThe search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV ; \nGuideline;  Practice Guideline;  Meta -Analysis; Randomized Controlled \nTrial; Systematic Reviews;  and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional \nsources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines as discussed by the \nPanel have been included in this version of the Discussion section.  \nRecommendations for which high- level evidence is lacking are based on \nthe Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist , and anti -weight -biased; and \ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. \nNCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nWilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma)  \n \nMS-3 on organ -specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, femal e, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources d o not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more  inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.   \nClinical Presentation and Initial Evaluation \nMost children present with signs suggesting the presence of a kidney condition, including abdomen swelling and/or a suspicious mass  (generally \nfirm, non -tender , smooth)  (83%) with or without abdomen pain (37%), \nfever (23%), hematuria (21% –25%), and hypertension (20% –25%).  Less \ncommon symptoms include:  varicocele, hernia, enlarged testicle, \ncongestive heart failure, hypoglycemia,  Cushing syndrome, pleural \neffusion, and acute abdomen.  Children may also be asymptomatic  with the \nabdomen mass being discovered either by a caretaker during routine \nactivities  like bathing or during examination by a pediatrician,  as these \ntumors can grow large in size prior to causing any symptoms . A second \nmethod of detection is through planned radiologic screening for children who have been identified as having a genetic predi sposition condition \nand/or congenital anomaly.  Tumors discovered on routine imaging are \ntypically  small and asymptomatic. There are other rare presentations that \nare found incidentally at surgery for another cause (eg, trauma, appendicitis). A healthy -appearing child with abdominal distension is more \nlikely to have WT, whereas an ill -appearing child with an abdomen mass \nmay have neuroblastoma. Left -sided kidney tumors may be mistaken for  splenomegaly  on clinical examination while right-sided tumors may be \nmistaken for  hepatomegaly.  Calcification of the tumor can also occur, but \nis less common in WT, appearing in approximately 5% to 10% of cases \nversus approximately 60% to 70% of neuroblastomas. It is important to \nnote that the abdominal mass should not be vigorously or frequently \npalpated to avoid rupturing the tumor.  \nInitial testing recommended for children with a suspicious abdom en mass \nincludes : history and physical examination including blood pressure \nmeasurement along with assessment for congenital anomalies  and \nscreening for genetic predisposition conditions if relevant (see Genetic \nPredisposition Conditions  below) . Blood tests , including a complete blood \ncount (CBC) with differential  and a comprehensive metabolic panel , \nshould be performed along with urinalysis (UA)  and evaluation of urine \nhomovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) to rule out \nneuroblastoma. An a ssessment of  coagulation with consideration of \nscreening for prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time (PT/PTT) should also be performed with further  workup for  von Willebrand disease if \nPT/PTT is abnormal  as almost 10%  of patients  with WT  have an acquired \nform of this disease .\n15-17 Imaging, including abdom inal ultrasound ( US), \nCT, or MRI of abdom en/pelvis  with intravenous contras t as well as non -\nsedated chest CT with or without contrast  (see Initial Evaluation in the \nalgorithm)  are also part of the initial evaluation. Oncofertility counseling \nshould also be considered at this time . \nThe goal of imaging at diagnosis  is to differentiate tumors of primary \nkidney  origin from extra -kidney  tumors  and from benign kidney  conditions; \nimaging will also determine whether a child has unilateral  or bilateral \nkidney disease and whether metastatic disease is present (see Principles \nof Imaging in the algorithm) . It is also important to assess for ascites, \nwhich may raise concern for tumor rupture.  Abdominal US is typically the \nfirst imaging modality utilized, because it is usually easily obtained, can be PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nWilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma)  \n \nMS-4 performed without sedation, does not expose the patient to radiation, and \ncan most often quickly ascertain both the presence of a mass and organ of \norigin.18,19 Abdominal and pelvic CT with contrast  or MRI  with and without \ncontrast  is then often used to evaluate the extent and involvement of the \nkidney  mass  identified on US .20,21 CT should include standard coronal and \nsagittal reconstructions. When bilateral disease is suspected, MRI is the \npreferred modality because it may help to distinguish between \nnephrogenic rests and WT (see Principles of Imaging in the algorithm) . If a \ndiagnosis of WT, or any malignant kidney tumor is suspected, further \nimaging assessment s for metastatic disease should be performed. Chest \nCT with and without contrast should be conducted for the evaluat ion of  \npulmonary nodules,  which are the most common site of metastatic \ndisease. The chest CT should be performed without sedation, as sedation \nincreases dependent atelectasis, which can obscure lung nodules .  \nThe differential diagnosis for c hildren with abdom inal swelling and/or a \nsuspicious mass includes WT, kidney tumors other than WT, extra- kidney \ntumors, and benign kidney conditions (see Principles of Abdominal Mass \nEvaluation in the algorithm). Kidney tumors other than WT include clear \ncell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) , congenital mesoblastic nephroma , \nrenal cell carcinoma (including renal medullary carcinoma) , rhabdoid \ntumor of the kidney , kidney  sarcoma, primitive  neuroectodermal tumors \n(PNETs ), DICER1 -associated sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell \ntumors (DSRCT), lymphoma, kidney  neuroblastoma, and perivascular \nepithelioid cell tumors (PEComas).  Other intrabdominal malignancies that \nwould produce a flank mass include Burkitt lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma, \nextrarenal WT, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, \nmalignant germ cell tumors, or other rare malignancies.  Patients with \nnephroblastomatosis are at risk for WT development and those with cystic nephroma are at risk for transformation to kidney sarcoma. Benign kidney  \nconditions need to be ruled out , includ ing adrenal hemorrhage, \nangiomyolipoma, dysplastic kidney, hydronephrosis, metanephric tumors (ie, adenoma, stromal tumor,  adenofibroma), multicystic kidney disease,  \npolycystic kidney  disease, renal hemorrhage, and renal vein  thrombosis . \nReferral to appropriate specialists or  consultation of the appropriate NCCN \nGuidelines  is recommended where applicable.  All patients with suspected \nWT should receive comprehensive care by a multidisciplinary team with experience in managing kidney  tumors led by a pediatric oncologist. \nAdditionally, while WT is largely a disease of children, adults may occasionally present with WT . Treatment for adults with WT is similar to \ntreatment for pediatric patients; thus, referral or partnership with a \npediatric oncologist familiar with the treatment of WT is recommended.  \nGenetic Predisposition Conditions  \nGenetic conditions predisposing children to develop WT may be present in \n10% to 15% of cases, with some reports suggesting that this number may \neven be as high as 30%.\n22-25 The highest risk of underlying cancer \npredisposition to WT is in individuals with bilateral/multifocal WT, those \nwith early -onset disease (<2 years of age), and/or those with familial WT \nas well as those with multiple nephrogenic rests or clinical features of WT \npredisposing conditions.26-28 Genetic testing and cancer predisposition \nconsultation should be considered for all patients with WT,  especially for \nthose with multifocal or bilateral WT,  but if counseling and testing is not \navailable for all children, decision- support algorithms such as the MIPOGG \ntool can be used for prioritization.29  \nCongenital anomalies, such as aniridia (1% of children with WT), \ngenitourinary abnormalities ( eg, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, fused \n[horseshoe] kidneys)  (5%), and hemihyperplasia (2 %–3%) may suggest \nthe presence of certain genetic predisposition conditions  that are \nassociated with a higher risk of WT.30-33 These predisposing conditions \ninclude: Denys -Drash syndrome ( features disorders of sexual \ndevelopment, mesangial sclerosis, renal failure, and usually 46 XY \nkaryotype) , WAGR/WAGR syndrome with obesity (WT, aniridia, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

Beck with-Wiedemann syndrome, Frasier \nsyndrome, Bohring- Opitz syndrome, MULIBREY (MUscle, LIver, BRain, \nEYes) Nanism syndrome, Li Fraumeni syndrome, and t risomy 18 \nsyndrome (also known as Edwards syndrome) are also predisposing \nconditions that are associated with a  low to  moderate risk for WT, and \ndescriptions of the characteristics of these conditions can be found in the \nPrinciples of Cancer Risk Assessment and Counseling section of the \nalgorithm. Approximately 10% of children with Beckwith- Wiedemann \nsyndrome will develop WT, but the risk varies with the genetic alteration. \nChildren with Beckwith -Wiedemann syndrome who have germline \nhypermethylation of 11p15 have the highest risk (24%) of developing WT. \nOther syndromes with a >1% risk include: Simpson- Golabi -Behmel \nsyndrome at 5% to 10%, Bloom syndrome at 3%, m osaic variegated \naneuploidy syndrome (BUB1B or TRIP13) at > 25%, Bohring- Opitz \nsyndrome (ASXL1) at 7% , and Sotos syndrome at <3% . \nVariants in WT1, a gene located within 11p13 that  codes a transcription \nfactor essential for normal kidney/genitourinary function, are implicated in \nthe development of WT.14,22,30- 33,41- 44 WT1 variants are found in WAGR \nsyndrome and Denys -Drash syndrome , with Deny s-Drash syndrome \ndemonstrating an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.  WT1 variants \nare also associated with Frasier syndrome. Similarly , WT2,  a gene located \nwithin 11p15 that results in overexpression of IGF2,  is implicated in WT \ndevelopment.  WT2 is associated with Beckwith -Wiedemann syndrome \nalong with CDKN1 C. Perlman syndrome is associated with DIS3L2 gene mutations and demonstrates an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. \nASXL1 , TRIM37, and TP53 are associated with Bohring- Opitz syndrome, \nMULIBREY Nanism syndrome, and Li -Fraumeni syndrome, respectively.38 \nAdditionally, f amilial WT gene mutations ( FWT1/FWT2,  which are on \nchromosomes  17q and 19q, respectively ) are rare (1% –2% of WT), are \nautosomal dominant with variable penetrance, and are not associated with \nthe WT1 mutation.45-48 For children with WT, their siblings will rarely get \nWT (<1%).   \nOther genes that have been found to be recurrently mutated in the \ngermline of patients with WT include: REST , TRIM28, FBXW7 , NYNRIN, \nKDM3B , XPO5 , and DICER1 .49-51 CTNNB1, DROSHA , WT1, AMER -1 \n(WTX) , DGCR8 , SIX1 , BCORL1 , MLLT1 , MYCN , and SIX2  are other  \ncommon somatic variants in WT .41 TP53 is also included in this list and is \nassociated with anaplastic WT.41  \nIt is important to note that the presence of a genetic predisposition \nsyndrome  does not mean that a child will develop WT. Germline testing \nshould be considered for children with physical findings consistent with a \npredisposition condition.  The American Association for Cancer Research \n(AACR)  recommends  screening in all children with a >1% risk of \ndeveloping WT, and the Pediatric Working Group of the AACR \nrecommends  renal US every 3 months until 7 years of age (ie, all of year \n6); thus, the NCCN Panel recommends  surveillance, including physical \nexamination and abdomen US, following this schedule.23,52- 55 The goal is \nto identify and treat the  WT at an  early stage when the tumor is small and \nasymptomatic ; this may hopefully be accomplished by partial \nnephrectomy, preserving renal tissue.  Children who present at a younger \nage are more likely to have multifocal /bilateral disease than children \nwithout a predisposition syndrome  and often have been identified as part \nof a surveillance program .23,53 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nWilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma)  \n \nMS-6 Initial Treatment  \nMost children present with resectable disease in one kidney, and upfront \nunilateral nephrectomy and regional lymph node ( LN) sampling is \nrecommended for these children.11 It is critical that LN sampling be \nperformed for adequate staging with a recommended minimum of 5 nodes \nbeing obtained from areas in the renal hilum that are anatomically \nexpected to represent nodes associated with the kidney .56 The preferred \nsurgical approaches  are transabdominal or thoracoabdominal exposure \nwith transperitoneal approach to avoid tumor spillage.57-60 Any tumor \nspillage or signs of preoperative tumor rupture must be documented to \nguide therapy.61 Patients with spillage or rupture are classified as stage \nIII.62 \nThe surgical goals for unilateral WT include removal of all disease  without \ndisrupting the tumor(s)  capsule(s)  (ie, no gross tumor spill), accurate LN  \nstaging, and complete pathologic evaluation (see Principles of Surgery  in \nthe algorithm) .56,63- 66 Primary resection also provides necessary biologic \ninformation for risk stratification and the selection of appropriate further \nadjuvant therapy , as testing is done on the surgical tissue specimens to \nconfirm the diagnosis, assess for certain molecular markers (eg, loss of \nheterozygosity [ LOH]), and determine histology (eg, anaplasia) .12,67 This \nultimately aids in minimizing treatment for patients at low risk and \nimproving survival for patients at higher risk (see Pathology and Staging \nbelow for more information).  \nIf a unilateral renal  tumor is found and is not resectable,  a tumor biopsy is \nnecessary (unless the patient has a predisposing condition)  so that  \ndiagnosis and molecular biomarker testing can be performed earl y to aid \nin guiding appropriate neoadjuvant treatment . The evaluation of \nresectability includes assessment of the following: number and extent of tumors; and whether the patient is at risk for pulmonary compromise, \ngross tumor spill, or long- term kidney  failure. Tumors may also be unresectable at diagnosis due to tumor extension to contiguous structures, \nsolitary kidney, tumor thrombus extending above the hepatic veins, the \npresence of bilateral tumors, involvement of surrounding organs, or \npulmonary function compromise from extensive metastatic disease, and/or \nrisk for significant morbidity or mortality.\n62 Metastases are not typically a \ncontraindication to surgery.  \nAn open posterior biopsy or a percutaneous core needle biopsy are the \ntwo options that should be considered. Fine- needle aspiration  (FNA)  is not \nrecommended. An open biopsy should be performed if surgical exploration is performed with the intent to resect but the tumor is deemed \nunresectable. There are limitations to information that can be obtained \nthrough biopsy , and it is critical to note that biopsy will automatically \nupstage the local stage to stage III , which will require additional \nchemotherapy and radiation therapy ( RT). Unless a rim of capsule or \nnormal tissue is included in the sample, a core or needle biopsy cannot distinguish between nephrogenic rests and WT. It is important to know that \nanaplastic histology is often not identified in patients who had core needle \nor open wedge resection biopsy; however, anaplastic histology is identified \nwhen evaluating tissue specimens from nephrectomy.\n68  \nFor unilateral renal  tumors in the presence of a predisposing condition as \nwell as bilateral renal  tumors with or without predisposing conditions, \ntumor resections should be delayed and neoadjuvant treatment should be initiated. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended to shrink the tumors \nbefore surgery in children with suspected bilateral WT, those with initially \nunresectable unilateral tumors, or those with predisposing conditions and \neither localized or metastatic unilateral renal  tumors .\n69,70 For tumors in \nthese categories that are <2 cm, close surveillance should be considered \ngiven the challenge of differentiating WT from proliferating nephrogenic \nrests, which are benign foci of embryonal kidney cells  and are precursors \nof WT.

Multifocal unilateral WTs are uncommon (7%) , therefore, the \nPanel recommends that proceeding with either primary nephrectomy or neoadjuvant therapy are reasonable approaches. For more information on \nfurther treatment recommendations for individual settings of WT, see the \ncorresponding section below.  \nPathology  and Staging  \nAccurate  confirmation and histologic  staging of WT is necessary for \nappropriate treatment of patients . Confirm ation of WT diagnosis and \ndetermination of local stage occur after surgery ; imaging is useful but may \noverstage or understage disease.\n18-20,71 Two major histopathologic  types of \nWT exist  and can be found at the time of  biopsy or  surgery : FHWT and \nanaplasia. FHWT implies the absence of focal or diffuse anaplasia and is \ncharacterized by undifferentiated blastemal cells as well as cells that have differentiated towards epithelial and stromal lineages. The most \ncharacteristic pattern is the tri phasic pattern where blastema, epithelial, \nand stromal lineages are all present , but biphasic and monophasic \npatterns  also exist . Tumors that are predominantly blastemal (66% of the \ntumor) are aggressive and invasive but are generally responsive to chemotherapy. Conversely, anaplastic WT generally has large, atypical \nmultipolar mitotic figures as well as nuclei that are greatly enlarged and hyperchromatic.\n72 These tumors can be classified  as either diffuse or focal  \nanaplasia with focality being determined by a localized or completely \nexcised area with anaplastic features.  A peritumoral fibrous capsule that \ndemarcates the tumor from adjacent renal parenchyma is an additional critical microscopic characteristic of WT. Chemotherapy can induce \nchanges in histology , leading to either reductions or increases in certain \nelements as well as maturation of blastemal, epithelial, and stromal components with striated muscle differentiation being the most common.\n73 \nBlastemal predominance after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered a high- risk histology group and may require more intensive treatment.  \nSurgical tissue is also used to evaluate  molecular markers. Unfavorable \nbiomarkers include 1q gain and LOH in 1p  and 16q, and LOH or loss of \nimprinting ( LOI) in 11p. Use of  11p15 LOH or LOI as unfavorable \nbiomarkers applies only to patients with very -low-risk disease. N o clinical \nevidence exists to use chromosome 17p13 to direct therapy. TP53 \nmutations are common in anaplastic tumors but almost never occur  in \nFHWT and have been shown to be a potential adverse prognostic factor in patients with stage III/IV disease when combined with anaplastic \nfeatures.\n74 More information can be found in the Principles of Pathology  \nsection in the algorithm.  \nIn Nor th America, the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) staging system \nfor WT is used (see Children’s Oncology Group [ COG ] Staging of Wilms \nTumor  in the algorithm)  with WTs being staged both locally (reflecting \nabdom inal spread of the tumor) and overall . Local stage  refers to the \nstaging of the primary tumor, regardless of metastases (eg, stage IV with \nlocal stage III) and is used to determine the need for RT  (flank or whole \nabdom en irradia tion [WAI]).71 WT can extend locally to perirenal soft \ntissues, renal vein, and vena cava. T he most common sites of \nhematogenous metastases include: lung (81%), lung and liver (15%), and \nother sites (4%); s pread to regional LNs also occurs.75 However, WT \nrarely metastasizes to bone and brain, unlike CCSK  or other kidney \ncancers.  Patients with any evidence of metastatic disease seen on \nimaging are categorized as stage IV. Abdominal staging can be stage I \n(limited to renal parenchyma); stage II  (demonstrating invasion into renal \npelvis or renal capsule) ; or stage III (with tumor outside the capsule, \nremaining in the abdomen, including finding of positive margins, \nconfirmation of preoperative rupture or intraoperative tumor spill, positive PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

Stage V WT refers to bilateral \ninvolvement, in which each kidney tumor is staged independently. Staging \nis critical to overall risk stratification and therapy assignment, for both \nchemotherapy and RT.  \nFurther Treatment  Recommendations for Individual \nSettings  \nOverview  \nTreatment for WT can range from surgery only to intensive chemotherapy, \nsurgery, and RT, depending on whether the WT is unilateral or bilateral, \nlocal stage, presence of metastases, patient’s age, tumor weight, biologic risk factors, histology, and clinical response to therapy. Risk stratification \nis used to determine the most appropriate therapy to minimize both risk of \nrecurrence and long- term toxicity from treatment.\n67,76,77 The goals of \ntreatment are to maximize cure and avoid relapse while appropriately risk -\nstratifying patients.  Tumor histology, histopathologic and surgical stage, \nmolecular markers ( such as 1q gain, LOH of 1p and 16q), presence of \nmetastatic and/or bilateral disease, and clinical factors —including age of \nthe child, presence or absence of predisposition syndromes, and response \nof pulmonary lesions to neoadjuvant chemotherapy —are all used in risk \nstrati fication. Other factors indicating need for more intensiv e therapy  \ninclude: unfavorable/anaplastic histology, higher stage, unfavorable \nmolecular biomarkers , and incomplete lung nodule response to \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy at week 6.  Discussions on potential toxicities \nof treatment as well as potential modifications can be found within the \nPrinciples of Chemotherapy  and Principles of Rad iation Therapy sections \nin the algorithm. Potential long- term effects of treatment are further \ndiscussed below  in the section on Follow -up After Completion of \nTreatment and Monitoring for Late Effects . Multidisciplinary evaluation with \nsurgeons, pediatric oncologists, and radiation oncologists is recommended \nprior to treatment.  Treatment of Unilateral FHWT  \nTreatment  of Unilateral FHWT, Primary Nephrectomy \nThe NCCN recommendations for treatment of children with FH WT are \nbased on clinical trial data from the COG , and older National Wilms Tumor \nStudy ( NWTS ) Group (NWTSG)  trials,  that have been used to identify \ntreatment regimens that can increase survival and decrease relapse, \nmorbidity, and long- term adverse events .78 The clinical trials performed  in \nEurope by the International Society of Pediatric Oncology  (SIOP) have \ntypically used neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery even if the tumor \nwas initially resectable.  By treating for presumed diagnosis, SIOP accepts \nthat a percentage of patients will be misdiagnosed as having WT (ie, false \npositive)  or that this may lead to inadequate staging as LN positivity and \nextension beyond the kidney capsul e may not be identified after pre-\nnephrectomy chemotherapy, which could be prognostically significant . \nNWTS G/COG have stressed the  importance  of determining tumor \nhistology and molecular markers up front . COG treatment regimens are \ndetermined in part by  stage and molecular  markers  in the tumor at \ndiagnosis. As discussed earlier, m ost children with WT have unilateral \ndisease and upfront nephrectomy with regional LN  sampling is \nrecommended , followed by adjuvant chemo therapy  or radiation , which are \nbased on an assessment of the risk  group  after surgery .  \nRisk stratification has evolved using data from large collaborative clinical \ntrials.  Initial risk assessment is based on age and clinical, radiographic, \nsurgical, and pathologic findings. Final risk assessment  is based on the \ninitial risk factors plus presence or absence of unfavorable molecular \nbiomarkers and the response of the lung metastases at week 6 , if \napplicable.  Excellent outcomes have been achieved for all stages of \nFHWT, including those patients with higher stage disease, unfavorable \nbiomarkers, and adverse clinical factors, such as incomplete response  of \nlung metastases ; these patients are stratified to more intensive therapy \nwith additional chemotherapy agents and RT.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nWilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma)  \n \nMS-9 molecular biomarkers , such as LOH of 1p and 16q, 1q gain, and LOH and \nLOI of 11p15 identified in tumor tissue , are associated with increased risk \nof relapse after initial therapy. Cytogenetic and molecular testing—for 1q \ngain and/or LOH of 1p and 16q—is recommended for all children with \nnewly diagnosed FHWT.10,79,80 To date, only augmentation of therapy for \ncombined LOH of 1p and 16 has been studied in a prospective clinical trial. However, the presence of certain unfavorable biomarkers clearly \nidentifies children with potential increased risk when treated with therapy \ndeintensification (patients classified with very -low-risk WT found to have \nLOH of 11p15, or patients with stage IV disease and rapid complete \nresponse [RCR] of pulmonary metastases found to have 1q gain). \nTherefore, clinicians should assess for  all of these biomarkers in all \nchildren with FHWT . Other molecular markers may be reported after \ntesting; however , at this time, data do  not support the use of other markers \nfor risk stratification. The use of specific molecular markers for risk -based \nassessment is evolving based on clinical trial data.\n81  \nPatients with FHWT are categorized as : 1) very low risk ; 2) low risk ; 3) \nstandard risk ; 4) higher risk ; and 5) bilateral . Final risk assessment \nincludes tumor biology and response of pulmonary nodules to initial \ntherapy; final risk assessment is used when deciding whether to continue \nthe initial chemotherapy  or switch to more intensive (augmented) \nchemotherapy  (see Initial and Final Risk Assessment for FHWT in the \nalgorithm) . Patients with very-low-risk, low- risk, and standard- risk FHWT \nwere studied in the NWTS -5 and AREN0532 trials.82,83 Patients with \nhigher -risk FHWT were studied in AREN0533.84 Clinical trial data from \nNWTS -5, AREN0532 , and AREN0533  are used to support the NCCN \nrecommendations for children with unilateral renal tumor s who do not have \npredisposing conditions.81 Very Low Risk   \nChildren with resectable unilateral WT typically receive upfront \nnephrectomy  followed by adjuvant therapy.85 However, clinical trial results \nsuggested that adjuvant therapy could be omitted in children who were \ndeemed at very low risk after upfront nephrectomy .86 The NWTS -5 trial \nassessed upfront nephrectomy followed by observation only in 77 children \nat very low risk after surgery.83 These children were deemed at very low \nrisk because they were < 2 years  of age , their tumor weight was <550 \ngrams, and they had  stage I  disease. These 77 children who only had \nsurgery were compared with 111 children who had  surgery plus adjuvant \nchemotherapy with EE4A. The estimated 5- year event -free survival (EFS) \nfor observation was 84% (95% CI, 73% –91%); it was 97% (95% CI, 92% –\n99%; P = .002) for EE4A. T he children who relapsed after surgery  alone \nwere successfully treated  with more intensive therapy than EE4A ( addition \nof doxorubicin and RT) . The estimated 5- year overall survival  (OS)  for \nsurgery only was 98% (95% CI, 87% –99%); it was 99% (95% CI, 94% –\n99%) for EE4A ( P = .70). At 8 years, the OS was still excellent  (98.7%) . \nData suggested that certain molecular markers in the tumors could be \nused to identify children who might be at higher risk after surgery alone; \nadjuvant chemotherapy could be used to decrease the risk of relapse in \nthis subset.80 The AREN0532 study assessed observation alone after \nupfront nephrectomy  in children at very low risk  after surgery .82 The trial \nassessed whether  observation only after surgery  alone was associated \nwith an acceptable level of survival and whether certain tumor molecular markers were associated with increased risk of relapse. The goal was to \navoid adjuvant chemotherapy  with EE4A , if feasible, and thus decrease \ntoxicity . For the 116 children observed after surgery  alone, OS was 100%; \nthe estimated 4 -year EFS was 89.7% (95% CI, 84.1% –95.2%).

One patient who relapsed had combined LOH of 1p and 16q \nin addition to 11p15 LOH.   \nBased on these results, the Panel suggests that c hildren with FHWT  fitting \nthe criteria of the COG very -low-risk group can either be observed without \nadjuvant therapy or receive adjuvant chemotherapy with EE4A after \nnephrectomy .82,83 EE4A is recommended for children with very -low-risk \nclinical features but with unfavorable prognostic molecular markers (11p15 \nLOH or LOI or combined LOH at 1p and 16q). Observation only after \nsurgery is recommended for children without these unfavorable biomarkers. Postoperative RT is not recommended for stage I disease. It \nshould be noted that deintensification of therapy may not be suitable for \npatients with 1q gain as presence of 1q gain has generally been \nassociated with inferior survival.  However, this is a rare circumstance  and \nmore data are stil l needed.  \nLow Risk  \nThe NWTS -5 trial showed that certain unfavorable tumor molecular \nmarkers were associated with poorer  relapse- free survival (RFS) in \nchildren with stage I and II FHWT.\n80 When treated with adjuvant EE4A, \nchildren with stage I or II FHWT with combined LOH at 1p and 16q had a \n4-year RFS of 74.9%  versus 91.2% for those without these markers ( P = \n.001). The AREN0532  and AREN0533  trials  showed that intensifying (ie, \naugmenting) adjuvant therapy to DD4A improved relapse- free, but not \noverall,  survival for patients with stage I or II FHWT with  combined LOH at \n1p and 16q compared with historical controls from NWTS -5.81  \nFor patients with stage I or II FHWT plus combined LOH 1p and 16q, the estimated 4 -year EFS was 68.8% (95% CI, 55.2% –82.3%) with EE4A  on \nNWTS -5 and 87.3%  (95% CI, 75.1% –99.5%) with DD4A on  AREN0532 ( P \n= .042).\n81 All four relapses occurred in patients with stage II FHWT who \nreceived DD4A.  For patients with stage I or II FHWT and LOH at 1p and \n16q, the estimated 4 -year OS was 91.6% (95% CI, 83.6% –99.6%)  with EE4A on NWTS -5 and 100% with DD4A on  AREN0532 ( P = .096).81 It is \nimportant to note that the AREN0532 and AREN0533 trials  were not \nsufficiently powered to detect statistical differences in OS with augmented \ntherapy (DD4A) , because combined LOH 1p and 16q occur s at low \nfrequencies (4.27% [49/1147]) in patients with stage I or II FHWT.  The \nimpact of intensification for a finding of 1q gain has not been studied.  \nThus, the Panel recommends that c hildren with FHWT at low risk after \nsurgery receive adjuvant therapy with regimen EE4A  (see Unilateral \nFHWT, Primary Nephrectomy  in the algorithm).81 If tumors have combined \nLOH at 1p and 16p, a switch to DD4A is preferred  while EE4A can be \ncontinued for children with tumors that do not have these unfavorable \nbiomarkers. Postoperative RT is not recommended for local stage I and II \ndisease.  \nStandard Risk and Higher Risk  \nThe NWTS -5 trial showed that certain unfavorable tumor molecular \nmarkers were associated with poorer  RFS in children with stage III or IV \nFHWT.80 When treated with adjuvant DD4A, children with stage III or IV \nFHWT  with combined LOH at 1p and 16q  had a 4- year RFS of 65.9% \nversus 83% for those without these unfavorable biomarkers ( P = .01). \nAREN0533 showed that augmenting adjuvant therapy to regimen M  at \nweek 7 improved RFS for 51 patients with stage III or IV FHWT plus \ncombined LOH 1p and 16q compared with historical controls from \nNWTS -5.81,82,84 For patients with stage III WT plus combined LOH 1p and \n16q treated with regimen M, the estimated 4 -year EFS was 87.1 % (95% \nCI, 75.1%–99.1% ) and the estimated 4- year OS was 93.6 % (95% CI, \n84.6% –100%). For patients with stage I V WT plus combined LOH 1p and \n16q treated with regimen M, the estimated 4 -year EFS was 95.0% (95% \nCI, 84.9%–100%) and the estimated 4- year OS was 100%.  Four relapses \nand two second malignancies occurred in patients with stage II I or IV  \nFHWT treated with regimen M .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nWilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma)  \n \nMS-11 For patients with stage III or IV FHWT plus combined LOH 1p and 16q \ntreated with DD4A , the estimated 4 -year EFS was 61.3% (95% CI, 44.9% –\n77.6%) for NWTS -5 and 90.2% (95% CI, 81.7% –98.6%) with regimen M \non AREN0532 and AREN0533 (P = .001).81 For patients with stage III or \nIV FHWT plus combined LOH 1p and 16q, the estimated 4- year OS was \n86.0% (95% CI, 74.5% –97.5%) with DD4A  on NWTS -5 and 96.1% (95% \nCI, 90.5% –100%) with regimen M on AREN0532 and AREN0533 ( P = \n.087).81 Some clinicians have concerns regarding  the comparability of \nhistorical control data that were used to justify augmenting therapy with \nregimen DD4A or M due to the historical control group that was used.87,88  \nBecause combined LOH 1p and 16q occur s at low frequencies (6.01% \n[82/1364]) in patients with stage III or IV FHWT , the AREN0532 and \nAREN0533 trials  were not powered to detect statistical differences in OS  \nwith augmented therapy. A different molecular marker, 1q gain, occurs \nmore frequently and is associated with inferior survival; 1q gain has been \nassessed in several studies, including patients with stage IV \nFHWT.10,79,84,89 The marker , 1q gain,  identif ies patients with isolated lung \nmetastases (ie, lung- only metastases)  at higher risk  who should receive \nwhole lung irradiation ( WLI) even if their lung metastases have completely \nresponded to the initial 6 weeks of treatment with regimen DD4A.84 \nHowever,  lung RT can be omitted in patients with lung- only metastases \nand no unfavorable markers (ie, no 1q gain, no combined LOH 1p and \n16q) who have a complete response ( CR) of their lung metastases after \nthe initial 6 weeks of treatment with regimen DD4A.  Although 1q gain has \nbeen identified as an adverse prognostic factor, no prospective studies \nhave been done to show that intensification of therapy is more effective. \nThe impact of 1q gain is greatest in higher risk  disease; it is up to the \nclinician and family to consider risks and benefits of intensification with \nknown treatment regimens. 1q gain can be used to identify patients who \nare not appropriate for deintensification of therapy, such as patients with rapid CR of lung nodules. Those with rapid CR and 1q gain have a high \nrisk of relapse if they are not treated with RT and DD4A (ie, EFS of 57%).  \nRegimen M may cause morbidity (eg, enhanced myelosuppression ) and \nlate effects including secondary leukemia (caused by cyclophosphamide and etoposide) and infertility (caused by cyclophosphamide).\n84,90,91 \nHowever , regimens to treat relapse are also associated with late effects, \nsuch as cardiomyopathy, second malignancy, and renal insufficiency.  In \npatients who have  stage III FHWT and who relapse, the cure rate is ≤50%.  \nThus, clinicians need to balance the possibility of late effects with regimen \nM versus the possibility of relapse without regimen M and also side effects \nassociated with these subsequent  regimens. The NCCN Panel \nrecommends referral for infertility risk/fertility preservation counseling for all patients treated with chemotherapy; counseling is strongly encouraged \nbefore treatment with regimen M or WAI.  \nDD4A is recommended  by the Panel  for patients with stage III FHWT \nclassified as standard risk after the initial risk assessment.\n81 The results of \nmolecular testing from diagnostic tissue are used to determine the final \nrisk assessment  and to select further therapy. Switching to augmented \ntherapy with regimen M is recommended for patients with combined LOH of 1p and 16q who are at increased risk  while those without combined \nLOH at 1p and 16q can continue on treatment with  DD4A. Flank RT or \nWAI is recommended for patients with local stage III , with WAI indicated \nfor the subset of patients with preoperative rupture, peritoneal tumor implants, and diffuse intraoperative tumor spillage. If RT is being \nconsidered, the timing of RT should be coordinated with chemotherapy to \navoid the coadministration of full doses of dactinomycin or doxorubicin \nwith WAI. \nDD4A is  also recommended as initial therapy for patients with stage IV \nFHWT classified as higher risk  with either lung- only metastases or \nextrapulmonary metastases (EPM) with or without lung metastases .

If patients have lung- only metastases  with no combined LOH at \n1q and 16q, no 1q gain, and R CR of lung metastases at week 6, \ncontinuation of DD4A is recommended. Continuation of DD4A is also \nrecommended for those patients who have lung- only metastases with  no \ncombined LOH at 1p and 16q, are 1q gain positive, and  have RCR of lung \nmetastases at week 6.  Intensif ication of treatment for patients with no \ncombined LOH at 1p and 16q, 1q gain positive, and R CR of lung \nmetastases at week 6 can be considered; however, this has not been \nstudied.  Switching to augmented therapy with regimen M is recommended \nfor patients wit h combined LOH of 1p and 16q or lung metastases that \nhave slow incomplete response (SIR) after 6 weeks of chemotherapy. In \npatients with EPM with or without lung metastases  and no combined LOH \nat 1p and 16q continuation of DD 4A is recommended while a swit ch to \nregimen M is preferred if patients have combined LOH at 1p and 16q. A  \nrecent study  that compares outcomes of patients with EPM  from the  \nAREN0533 and NWTS -5 studies  revealed that the 4 -year EFS in patients \ntreated with regimen M was 76% (95% CI, 64.6– 89.4) versus 64.9% (95% \nCI, 51.7 –82.2) ( P = .26) in patients treated with DD4A.92 No differences in \nOS were observed; therefore,  the Panel does not recommend  regimen  M \nin the EPM without LOH setting but recommended a switch to regimen M \nin patients with combined LOH at 1p and 16q.  \nPostoperative flank RT or WAI is recommended for patients with local \nstage III disease. Local stage III refers to staging at the primary site \nregardless of metastases (see Children’s Oncology Group [ COG]  Staging \nof Wilms Tumor  in the algorithm). WAI is indicated for the subset of local \nstage III patients with preoperative rupture, peritoneal tumor implants, and diffuse intraoperative tumor spillage. W LI is recommended for patients \nwith tumors that do not have combined LOH at 1p and 16q, but are 1q \ngain positive, and who had an  RCR of lung metastases at week 6 as  omission of WLI  for patients with R CR of lung metastases at week 6 and \n1q gain is not recommended due to lower EFS (57%).\n84 Additionally, WLI \nin patients that have  combined LOH at 1p and 16q or SIR of lung \nmetastases  is recommended while WLI along with RT to other metastatic \nsites should be done for patients with EPM  with lung metastases.  Studies \nshow that starting RT >14 days after surgery is associated with an \nincreased risk of abdo men recurrence in patients without metastases.93 \nThus, the NCCN Panel recommends that RT should start by day 10 after \nsurgery but no later than day 14.94,95 However, patient factors should be \nconsidered when deciding about the timing of adjuvant RT, including age \nand need to assess the response of lung metastases to chemotherapy \nwhen giving WAI and WLI. If RT is being considered, the timing of RT \nshould be coo rdinated with chemotherapy to avoid the coadministration of \nfull doses of dactinomycin or doxorubicin with WAI or WLI  (see Principles \nof Chemotherapy  in the algorithm). Dactinomycin or doxorubicin can be \nadministered at full doses before starting RT. Addi tionally, the Panel \nrecognizes the concern for overlapping fields if the abdomen and lungs  \nare treated at different times and recommend planning for possible \nabdomen and lung fields with initial abdomen RT planning, even if lung RT \nis ultimately not given, to minimize the degree of overlapping fields.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nWilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma)  \n \nMS-13 As mentioned previously, a  tumor biopsy should first be performed for \ndiagnosis and for molecular biomarker testing.  If there is pathologic \nconfirmation of WT upon biopsy , neoadjuvant therapy with DD4A is \nrecommended for children with unilateral renal  tumors that are initially \nunresectable if there are no predisposing conditions.80,81 At week 6 of \nDD4A  treatment , the primary tumor is reimaged  with repeat imaging of the \nlungs (if metastases were present initially) . If contrast or non- contrast \nchest CT is performed, it is important to emphasize that this should be \nobtained prior to anesthesia to minimize atelectasis, which may obscure \nmetastatic pulmonary nodules . If the tumor is resectable at week 6, \npatients should undergo  nephrectomy with regional LN sampling.  If the  \ntumor remains unresectable,  continue with DD4A . Chemotherapy should \nbe continued for a total of 12 weeks if the patient has some response at \nweek 6 but is not deemed a candidate for surgery. However, surgery is recommended for all patients at a maximum of week 12 of neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy based on clinical trial data showi ng that continuing \nchemotherapy beyond 12 weeks usually does not yield continued tumor shrinkage.\n70,97 Conversely, if imaging shows tumor progression after  \nneoadjuvant treatment, defined as an increase in size, nephrectomy or \nrebiopsy to evaluate for anaplasia or rhabdomyomatous changes should \nbe performed.  \nUpon confirm ation  of FHWT  in the surgical specimen, molecular and \nimaging results are used to determine the final risk category  and to select \nfurther therapy.  Patients either continue regimen DD4A or switch to \nregimen M, depending on the risk assessment . Augmented therapy with \nregimen M is recommended for patients who are at increased risk, \nincluding those with:  1) localized FHWT and combined LOH at 1p and \n16q; or 2) FHWT with combined LOH at 1p and 16q and metastases only \nin the lung that have SIR  to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Otherwise, \ncontinuation of DD4A is recommended.  Intensification of chemotherapy \ncan be considered in patients with no combined LOH at 1p and 16q, 1q gain, and R CR of lung metastases at week 6, but it has not been studied.  \nFor patients with EPM with or without lung metastases  and no combined \nLOH at 1p and 16q, continuation of DD4A is recommended while \nswitching to regimen M is recommended for tho se patients who se \ndiseases  possess es LOH at 1p and 16q in this setting, s imilar to  the \nrecommendations for high- risk resectable unilateral renal  tumor with no \npredisposing conditions above.  If pathology indicates WT with anaplasia, \nsee Treatment of Unilateral and Bilateral Anaplastic WT below.  \nPostoperative flank RT or WAI is recommended for patients with local stage III disease. WLI  is recommended in patients whose lung metastases \nresponded to 6 weeks of neoadjuvant chemotherapy  but who also have 1q \ngain or in patients with combined LOH at 1p and 16q or SIR of lung \nmetastases at week 6. WLI is recommended for patients with tumors that \ndo not have combined LOH at 1p and 16q, but are 1q gain positive, and \nhad an  RCR of lung metastases at week 6 as omission of WLI for patients \nwith RCR of lung metastases at week 6 and 1q gain led to a lower EFS \n(57%).\n84 WLI should also be considered in patients with EPM  with lung \nmetastases along with radiation to other metastatic sites.  The NCCN \nPanel recommends that RT should start by day 10 after surgery but no \nlater than day 14.94,95 However, patient factors should be considered when \ndeciding about the timing of adjuvant RT, including age and need to \nassess the response of lung metastases to chemotherapy when giving \nWAI and WLI.

Of the 32 patients who underwent \nsurgery, 15 had surgery at week 6 and 17 had surgery at week 12. O pen \nkidney  biopsy was allowed in order  to determine the histology  before \ncontinuing with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  By 12 weeks of neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy, most patients had a partial response (62% [21/34]) or \nstable disease (32% [11/34]); 2 patients had a CR ; there was no progressive disease. Surgery included partial or total nephrectomy with \nregional LN sampling followed by determination of the pathology. A total \nnephrectomy was done if patients had a less than partial response to \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy at week 6. Partial nephrectomies were done in \n63% (20/32) of patients.  \nAfter surgery, risk assessment was completed  using histology results and \nstage to select further therapy including adjuvant chemotherapy  with or \nwithout RT .\n98 Use of molecular biomarkers to direct therapy was not \nincluded in AREN0534; however, outcomes were excellent despite not \naugmenting chemotherapy for the presence of unfavorable biomarkers. \nThe 4-year EFS was 94% (95% CI,  85.2% –100%) and the 4-year OS was \n100% . Patients with stage I or II FHWT without blastemal -predominant  \nhistology are at lower  risk of relapse after surgery; therefore, they \ncontinued receiving less intensive adjuvant therapy with EE4A and did not receive adjuvant RT.\n98 Patients with blastemal -predominant  histology \nfollowing neoadjuvant chemotherapy are at greater risk of relapse after \nsurgery; therefore, they switched to more intensive adjuvant therapy with \nDD4A or regimen I, depending on the stage.98,99  \nConcordant with these results , the Panel recommends neoadjuvant \ntherapy with the EE4A regimen for children with a localized unilateral renal  \ntumor and a predisposing condition. As mentioned previously, upfront \nbiopsy or resection is discouraged in this setting,  but if an upfront biopsy \nwas performed, then the VAD regimen is to be used as neoadjuvant \ntherapy.  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not a criterion for upstaging to \nstage III in this population.  If biopsied, a tumor is considered stage III for \ndetermining chemotherapy regimen,  but biopsy alone does not upstage a \ntumor to stage III for determining whether to give RT.  At week 6 of EE4A \n(or VAD), the tumor is reimaged, with repeat imaging of the lungs  being \ndone before general anesthesi a, and further treatment is dictated \ndepending on the response.

If the tumor is resectable by partial  nephrectomy  at week 6, a partial \nnephrectomy  when feasible or total nephrectomy  with regional LN \nsampling is recommended.  NSS should be prioritized.  A total nephrectomy \nis indicated for patients with unilateral WT who are at high risk for bilateral \nWT for whom a partial nephrectomy is not feasible after 6 weeks of \nchemotherapy and with less than a partial response to chemotherapy or \nfor patients for w hom a partial nephrectomy is not feasible after 12 week of \nchemotherapy.98 After pathology confirms that patients have FHWT, \nhistology (ie, whether blastemal -predominant or not ) and staging are used \nto select further therapy (see Children’s Oncology Group [COG ] Staging of \nWilms Tumor  in the algorithm ). If pathology shows stage I or II FHWT that \nis not blastemal -predominant , then EE4A is continued while a switch to \nDD4A is recommended if pathology shows  stage III FHWT with no \nblastemal predominance or stage I FHWT with blastemal predominance. A \nswitch to Regimen I is recommended f or patients with stage II –III FHWT \nand blastemal predominance.  Augmented therapy with regimen I is \nrecommended for patients with blastemal -predominant histology and stage \nII or III FHWT, because they are at the greatest risk  of rel apse . Regimen \nM has not been studied in this population. Use of molecular biomarkers to \ndirect therapy has not been studied in this setting; outcomes on \nAREN0534 were excellent despite not augmenting chemotherapy for the \npresence of unfavorable biomarkers.  If anaplasia is found on pathology, \nsee Treatment of Unilateral and Bilateral Anaplastic WT below . For \npatients with  a partial response at week 6 but their  disease is still not \nresectable,  continuation of EE4A (or VAD) for a total of 12 weeks is \nrecommended . Resection of the tumor should then occur by  no later than \nweek 12 as significant continued tumor shrinkage beyond this point has not been observed.\n70,97 If there is a less than partial response at week 6  or \nat week 12, partial or total nephrectomy with regional LN  sampling is \nrecommended as above .100 The decision to do a partial versus total \nnephrectomy is based on tumor size, location in the kidney, extension into the kidney collecting system, and other factors.  For those with a CR at week 12 of EE4A, refer to the CR pathway dictated earlier in this treatment \nrecommendation.   \nRT is not recommended for  patients who have  had a CR at week 6 to \nregimen EE4A . Similarly, RT is not recommended for t hose with stage I or \nII FHWT that are not blastemal -predominant  or stage I FHWT with \nblastemal predominance . Flank RT or  WAI is recommended for  local stage \nIII with or without blastemal predominance. The patient’s age and other \nfactors are considered when deciding about the timing of RT. The NCCN \nPanel recommends that RT should start by day 10 after surgery but no \nlater than day 14 , and planning for possible abdominal and lung fields is \nrecommended to minimize the degree of overlap. However, some degree \nof overlap is expected in order to cover the target . See Principles of \nRadiation Therapy in the algorithm  for more information.  \nMetastatic Unilateral Renal Tumor W ith a Predisposing Condition  \nThe AREN0534 study  also assessed  VAD for 6 weeks followed by either \nsurgery or continuation of VAD for an additional 6 weeks in children who \nhad metastatic unilateral renal  tumor and who were predisposed to \ndevelop metachronous bilateral disease because of hemihyperplasia or a \ngenetic syndrome, such as Beckwith- Wiedemann syndrome.53,98,101 One of \nthe 32 patients who underwent surgery had stage IV disease.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not a criterion for upstaging to stage \nIII in this population. If the tumor was biopsied, however, the tumor is \nconsidered to be stage III for determination of chemotherapy regimen  \npostoperatively , but biopsy alone does not upstage a tumor to stage III for \ndetermining  whether to give radiation.

Patients whose  renal  tumors  have  a CR to VAD  \nare recommended to switch to regimen DD4A.  In patients whose  tumors \nare now resectable by partial nephrectomy a fter week 6 of VAD , partial \nnephrectomy when feasible or total nephrectomy with regional LN sampling is recommended.  Indications f or complete nephrectomy can be \nfound in the above section or in Principles of Surgery  within the algorithm.  \nAfter pathology confirms that patients have WT, histology (ie, whether \nblastemal -predominan t or not ) is used to select further therapy. If \npathology indicates FHWT but no blastem al predominance,  then switching \nto DD4A is recommended while a switch to regimen I is recommended for \npatients with FHWT with blastem al predominance . Augmented therapy \nwith regimen I is recommended for patients with blastemal -predominant \nhistology after neoadjuvant therapy, because they are at greater risk  of \nrelapse. Regimen M has not been studied in this population. If WT with anaplasia is shown on pathology, see Treatment of Unilateral and Bilateral \nAnaplastic WT  below . For patients who do not have resectable disease by \npartial nephrectomy at 6 weeks and have less than a partial response of \nrenal  tumors or progression, the same process is followed. If patients have \na partial response of renal  tumors,  then continuation of VAD is recommended with reimaging at week 12. Tumors should be resected by \nweek 12 at the latest (partial or total nephrectomy) , because significant \ntumor shrinkage is rarely  observed beyond  that point in treatment .\n70,97 The \ndecision to do a partial versus total nephrectomy is based on tumor size, \nlocation in the kidney, extension into the kidney collecting system, and \nother factors.  If a CR is observed at week 12, refer to the CR pathways \ndiscussed above.   \nWLI for lung metastases  and/or radiation to other sites ( eg, LNs), without \nflank radiation,  is recommended for patients with a CR.  All other patients \nshould receive flank radiation or WAI for local stage III disease, WLI  for \nlung metastases , and radiation to other sites as needed. The Panel \nrecommends that RT  should start  10 days after surgery  but no later than \nday 14; the patient’s age and other factors are considered when deciding about the timing of RT. Local stage III refers to the staging at the primary \ntumor, regardless of metastases, and is used to determine the need for \nflank RT or WAI (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the algorithm). \nBiopsy alone does  not upstage a tumor to stage III for determining \nwhether to give RT. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also not a criterion for \nupstaging to stage III in this setting. Omission of WLI based on the \nresponse of lung metastases at week 6 of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has \nnot been studied in this group of patients.  \nTreatment of Bilateral FHWT  \nTreatment of Localized and Metastatic Bilateral Renal Tumors With or \nWithout a Predisposing Condition  \nChildren with bilateral WT have a greater incidence of predisposition syndromes and a greater risk for developing metachronous tumor s after \ntreatment, probably because of an increased incidence of nephrogenic \nrests.\n14,22,98 Children who present at a younger age are more likely to have \nmultifocal /bilateral disease and their tumors are often  identified as part of a \nsurveillance program .23,53 When compared with unilateral WT,  children PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

Unfortunately, the incidence of end- stage kidney disease \nis higher (12%) in children with bilateral WT compared with unilateral WT \n(0.6%).36,102 In patients with small lesions suspicious for bilateral WT, it \nmay be difficult to distinguish nephrogenic rests from WT using CT \nimaging and percutaneous biopsies; MRI may be useful in this setting.   \nThe AREN053 4 trial assessed neoadjuvant therapy with VAD for 6 weeks \nfollowed by either surgery or continuation of VAD for an additional 6 weeks \nin 189 evaluable children with bilateral FHWT.100 This trial also assessed \ntreatment in children with unilateral WT and a predisposing syndrome. For more information, on this trial or treatments in these settings, see \nLocalized U nilateral  Renal Tumor  with Predisposing Condition or \nMetastatic Unilateral Renal Tumor w ith Pred isposing Condition above. \nSurgery was done at either 6 weeks or 12 weeks after neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on the response at 6 weeks; continuing \nchemotherapy beyond 12 weeks usually does not yield continued tumor \nshrinkage.\n70,97 If there was a less than partial response at week 6, open \nbiopsies in both kidneys were done to determine the histology  before \ncontinuing with VAD. However, bilateral kidney tumors in children that are \nnot WT are very uncommon. By 12 weeks, most patients had a partial \nresponse to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Surgery was done with the goal \nof preserving as much kidney function as possible, if feasible, and \nincluded 1) a partial nephrectomy on one or both sides; or 2) a total \nnephrectomy with regional LN sampling on one side and a contralateral \npartial nephrectomy. Data show that use of partial nephrectomy preserves \nkidney function in patients with bilateral WT.103 Most patients (84%) had \nundergone surgery by 12 weeks; 61% of patients needed a complete \nnephrectomy in at least one kidney.  Histology results and stage were used to select further therapy including \nRT and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. To determine adjuvant therapy, risk \nassessment was performed using the kidney with the highest stage. \nPatients with complete necrosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or with stage I FHWT without blastemal -predominant histology are at lower risk of \nrelapse after surgery; therefore, they received EE4A, which is less intensive adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with blastemal -predominant \nhistology are at greater risk of relapse after surgery; therefore, they \nreceived more intensive adjuvant therapy.\n99,100 For 11 children with \nbilateral FHWT and blastemal -predominant  histology on ARE N0534, the \n4-year EFS was 81.8% ( 95% CI, 42.3% –100%) and the 4- year OS was \n91% ( 95% CI, 64.1% –100%).100 For 140 children with bilateral FHWT but \nwithout blastemal -predominant histology on ARE N0534, the 4- year EFS \nwas 83.18% ( 95% CI, 73.2% –92.96%) and the 4- year OS was 97. 7% \n(95% CI, 93.90% –100%) .100 On the older NWTS -5 trial, 4 -year EFS was \n65% for patients with bilateral FHWT .7  \nBased on these results, the Panel recommends n eoadjuvant therapy with \nthe VAD regimen for children with localized bilateral renal  tumors with or \nwithout a predisposing condition. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not a \ncriterion for upstaging to stage III in this population. Upfront biopsy or \nresection is discouraged in this setting, but if a biopsy was perform ed, the \ntumor is considered stage III for determination of chemotherapy regimen \nbut does not upstage a tumor to stage III for radiation determination. \nSurg ery is done at either 6 weeks or 12 weeks after neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy based on the response; data show that continuing \nchemotherapy beyond 12 weeks usually does not yield continued tumor \nshrinkage.70,97 NSS is reserved for patients with bilateral disease, those \nwho have a genetic predisposition, those with a solitary or horseshoe \nkidney, or those at other higher risk for kidney  failure.104- 107 Thus, either  1) \na partial nephrectomy on both sides; or 2) a total nephrectomy and a \ncontralateral partial nephrectomy , is recommended to preserve as much PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

In either case, regional LN \nsampling should be performed  (see Principles of Surgery  in the algorithm \nfor more information about the surgical approach to bilateral WT) . At week \n6 of VAD, the tumors are reimaged and depending on the response, \npatients 1) have no surgery if there was a CR to VAD; 2) have either \nunilateral or  bilateral partial nephrectomies  with regional LN sampling if the \ntumors are now resectable; or 3) continue with VAD for a total of 12 weeks \nif the tumors are still unresectable but a partial response was observed . If \nthere is a less than partial response  or progression at week 6, open \nbiopsies of both kidneys are recommended to determine the histology  \nbefore continuing with chemotherapy , which should be adjusted based on \nhistology . If the biopsy reveals blastemal predominance (all stages), then \nRegimen I should be used, o therwise, VAD should be continued. If the \nbiopsy s hows anaplasia, see Treatment of Unilateral and Bilateral \nAnaplas tic WT  later in this discussion.  Re-evaluation and s urgery are then \nrecommended at week 12.  \nPatients who had a CR at week 6 of VAD should be switched to EE4A. If a \npatient has  surgery after 6 weeks of VAD and  pathology confirms that \npatients have FHWT, staging and histology (ie, blastemal predominance ) \nare used to select further therapy. Use of molecular biomarkers to direct \ntherapy has not been studied in this setting. Switching to regimen EE4A is  \nrecommended for patients with stage I FHWT without blastemal -\npredominant histology  or for  those with stage I–II FHWT with complete \nnecrosis. Conversely , switching to regimen DD4A is recommended for \npatients with stage II or III FHWT without blastemal -predominant histology \nor for those with stage I FHWT with blastemal -predominant histology. \nAugmented therapy with regimen I is recommended for patients with stage \nII or III FHWT with blastemal -predominant histology, because they are at \ngreatest risk. If pathology shows WT with anaplasia, see Treatment of  \nUnilateral and Bilateral Anaplastic WT  later in this Discussion . Patients \nwho had a CR  after 12 weeks of V AD should be switched to DD4A  while those with less than a CR should undergo partial nephrectomy as \ndiscussed earlier . A total nephrectomy  with regional LN sampling is \nindicated in patients with bilateral WT if a partial nephrectomy is not \nfeasible at this point.  \nNo RT is needed for patients with a CR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy  or \nfor those with resectable disease that showed FHWT stage I with or \nwithout blastemal predominance or stage I –II with complete necrosis. \nFlank radiation or WAI for local stage III is recommended for all other \npatients , with WAI indicated for the subset of patients with preoperative \nrupture, peritoneal tumor implants, and diffuse intraoperative tumor \nspillage . However, stage III that is upstaged because of biopsy alone will \nnot receive RT. The Panel recommends that RT should start at day  10 \nafter surgery but no later than day  14; the patient’s age and other factors \nshould be considered when deciding about the timing of RT. The concern \nfor overlapping fields is acknowledged by the Panel, which recommends \nplanning for possible abdominal and lung fields to minimize the degree of \noverlap. Some degree of overlap is expected to cover the target . \nFor children with bilateral renal  tumors  and metastatic  disease with or \nwithout a predisposing condition, the Panel recommends neoadjuvant \ntherapy with the VAD regimen based upon the aforementioned results of \nthe AREN0534 trial .100 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not upstage to \nlocal stage III in this population. Upfront biopsy or resection is discouraged \nin this setting , but if performed, the tumor is considered to be local stage III \nfor determination of chemotherapy but not for the determination of whether \nto give radiotherapy . At week 6 of VAD, the tumor is reimaged (both \nprimary and metastatic sites) and further treatment is dependent  on \nresponse.  Patients  with a CR of renal  tumors after 6 weeks of VAD should \nswitch to DD4A.

If re-\nimaging at week 12  shows  less than CR, then partial nephrectomy (one or \nboth sides) when feasible or total nephrectomy with regional LN sampling should occur  to determine histopathology and patients should  then follow \nthe same protocol as outlined above. Surgery is done at either 6 weeks or \n12 weeks after neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on data showing that \ncontinuing chemotherapy beyond 12 weeks usually does not yield \ncontinued tumor shrinkage.\n70,97 NSS is recommended to preserve as much \nkidney function as possible, if feasible, including:  1) a partial nephrectomy \nat one or both sides; or 2) a total nephrectomy and a partial nephrectomy \non the contralateral side. In either case, regional LN sampling should be \nperformed . If a CR  is observed at week 12 of VAD , then patients should \nbe switched to DD4A. Conversely , if a less than partial response in either \nkidney or progression is observed at week 6 of VAD, then bilateral open biopsies  are recommended if partial nephrectomy  is still not feasible . \nChemotherapy should be adjusted based on histology . Regimen I should \nbe used in this instance if the biopsy reveals blastemal predominance \nregardless of stage while VAD can be used otherwise. Re- evaluation in \nboth circumstances should be done at week 12. If anaplasia is discovered upon biopsy, see Treatment of Unilateral and Bilateral Anaplastic WT  \nbelow.  \nPatients with a CR of renal  tumors  after 6 weeks of neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy do not need flank  RT. However, WLI for lung metastases  and/or radiation to other metastatic sites, such as LNs, are recommended. \nFlank radiation or  WAI for local stage III disease along with WLI and \nradiation to other metastatic sites should be given to patients with FHWT with or without blastemal predominance in this setting. The Panel \nrecommends that RT should start by day 10 after surgery  but no later than \nday 14; the patient’s age and other factors  should be considered when \ndeciding about the timing of RT. Local stage III refers to the staging at the primary tumor, regardless of metastases, and is used to determine the \nneed for flank RT or WAI (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the \nalgorithm). Overlapping fields are recognized as a concern if the abdomen \nand lung are treated at different times ; thus, the Panel recommends \nplanning for possible abdominal and lung fields with initial abdominal RT \nplanning to minimize over lap. Some degree of overlap between fields is to \nbe expected in order to cover the target.  \nTreatment of  Unilateral and Bilateral  Anaplastic WT \nAnaplasia has been associated with unfavorable outcomes in WT and can \nbe divided into focal and diffuse subtypes. Updates to the definitions of these subtypes in 1996 spurred retrospective studies that revealed that \npatients with focal anaplasia have signif icantly better outcomes than those \nwith diffuse anaplasia, raising the issue of optimal treatments for these different subtypes.\n108,109 The AREN0321 trial  sought to address this and \ndemonstrated an improvement in outcomes in eight patients with stage I \nfocal anaplastic WT and 10 patients with  stage I  diffuse anaplastic WT \ntreated with DD4A plus flank radiation.110 EFS and OS were each 100% as \ncompared to an updated analysis of 27 patients from the NWTS -5 study, \nwhere EFS and OS were 70.0% and 81.5%, respectively.110 Treatment of \nchildren with focal anaplasia, especially those with stages II to IV \nanaplastic WT, with regimen DD4A on NWTS -5 also showed excellent \noutcomes .111 A recent  study indicated that patients with advanced stage IV \nfocal anaplastic disease have improved survival  with the use of revised \nregimen UH -1, but this wa s also associated with an increased risk of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

Additionally, this same study also suggests that a potential \nincrease in intensity of treatment could be warranted for stage III focal \nanaplastic WT based on inferior outcomes observed in the AREN0321 \nstudy.112 113 \nEvaluation of the UH -1 regimen in stage II –IV diffuse anaplastic WT in the \nAREN0321 trial indicated that the 4 -year EFS , RFS,  and OS rates for the \n66 enrolled patients with stage II –IV disease were 67.7% , 72.9%,  and \n73.7%, respectively , as compared to 57.5% , 57.5%,  and 59.2% in the \nNWTS -5 study .13 Patients in this study with stage IV measurable disease \nwere also able to receive the addition of vincristine and irinotecan (the \nregimen together was deemed UH -2) with 1 patient achieving a CR while \n10 patients achieved a partial response  out of 14 patients .13 Both \nregimens UH -1 and UH -2 were modified due to the frequency of \nnonhematologic toxicities  to what is now called revised regimen  UH-1 and  \nrevised regimen UH-2 to reduce the cumulative doses of doxorubicin, \ncyclophosphamide, and etoposide to levels similar to those used in \nregimen I.13 No differences were observed in EFS between the original \nand revised UH -1 and - 2 regimens.13 Moreover, patients treated with \nrevised UH -2 seemed to do better than those who received revised UH -1, \nbut the number of patients was small.13 Additionally, the AREN0321 trial \nfor patients with diffuse anaplasia also indicated potential dosing changes \nto RT for these patients with 10.8 Gy to the flank being recommended for \npatients with stage I and II disease due to excellent local control  rates .13 \nFor stage III diffuse anaplasia, 19.8 Gy to the flank and 10.5 Gy to the \nwhole abdomen followed by 9 Gy to the flank is the supported regimen \nwith a reduced local relapse rate compared to that observed in the NWTS -\n5 study (6.4% v s. 14.8%). However, this was not statistically significant.13 \nStudies , such as the AREN1921 trial (NCT04322318),  are currently \nongoing with the goal of  alleviat ing the toxicit ies of the UH-1 and UH -2 \nregimens and their revised forms  in patients who are high risk through the use of the new UH -3 regimen (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, \ncarboplatin, etoposide, and irinotecan).  \nUnilateral WT W ith Focal or Diffuse Anaplasia, Primary Nephrectomy or \nPost-partial or T otal Nephrectomy With Predisposing Condition  \nBased on the results of the AREN0321 trial discussed above, t he NCCN \nPanel recommends DD4A for stage I –III focal anaplastic disease;  \nhowever, i ntensification of therapy may be warranted for stage III disease \nbased on the inferior outcomes observed in the AREN0321 study.  For \nstage IV focal anaplastic disease, revised regimen UH -1 is recommended. \nRadiation therapy of the flank for stage I or II is recommended w hile flank \nor WAI is recommended for stage III. W LI for lung metastases or radiation \nto other  metastatic  sites is also recommended  for stage IV disease.  \nFor diffuse anaplasia in this setting, DD4A should be used  for stage I \ndisease along with flank radiation. The revised UH -2 regimen is \nrecommended  for patients with stage II –IV diffuse anaplastic WT along \nwith flank radiation for local stage II and flank or whole abdomen radiation \nfor local stage III disease. The  higher dose of radiation for stage III diffuse \nanaplastic WT  lowers the risk of local recurrence  as noted above. Addition \nof WLI for lung metastases and radiation to other metastatic sites is also \nnoted for appropriate patients. RT to the primary  site should be conducted \nwithin 10  to 14 days after surgery. Overlapping fields may be a concern ; \nthus, the Panel recommends planning for possible abdominal and lung \nfields with initial abdominal planning even if lung RT is not ultimately given \nto minimize overlap. Some degree of overlap is to be expected to cover \nthe target.  \nUnilateral WT W ith Diffuse Anaplasia, Initially Unresectable, No \nPredisposing Condition  \nAs mentioned earlier in this discussion, a tumor biopsy is strongly \nrecommended as initial treatment for patients with unilateral renal  tumor s \nthat are initially unresectable in the absence of predisposing conditions.

In patients who \npresent with unilateral WT with diffuse anaplasia that is initially \nunresectable with no predisposing conditions, revised regimen UH -2 is \nrecommended. Re- imaging should be performed after 6  weeks and , if the \ntumor is now resectable, patients should undergo nephrectomy with \nregional LN sampling followed by continuation of revised regimen UH -2 \nalong with flank radiation or WAI. WLI for lung metastases as well as \nradiation to other metastatic  sites should be included in patients with \nmetastases.  A higher dose of radiation  is recommended for stage III \ndisease as noted above due to the lower risk of local recurrence.

F lank radiation  for stage I or II  and flank or  WAI for  \nstage III focal anaplastic disease  is recommended while flank radiation \nshould be used for stage I bilateral diffuse  anaplasia. Intensification of chemotherapy treatment may be warranted for stage III focal anaplastic \ndisease based on inferior outcomes observed based on a recent \nanalysis.112 Conversely, for patients with stage IV focal anaplastic \ndisease, a switch to revised regimen UH -1 is recommended while a \nswitch to the revised regimen UH -2 is recommended for stage II –IV \ndiffuse anaplasia. R adiation to the flank for local stage II diffuse  \nanaplastic disease and flank or WAI for local stage III  is also \nrecommended . A higher RT dose is recommended for stage III diffuse \ndisease as the risk of local recurrence was shown to be reduced as \ndiscussed previously.112 WLI or radiation to other metastatic  sites is \nrecommended for metastatic disease. The Panel recommends that RT \nshould start 10 days after surgery  but no later than day 14 . Overlapping \nfields may be a concern;  thus, the Panel recommends planning for \npossible abdominal and lung fields with initial abdominal planning even if \nlung RT is not ultimately given to minimize overlap.

Current studies, including \nthe AREN1921 trial, are investigating additional treatment regimens for \nrelapsed FHWT, specifically looking at the use of UH -3 in standard -risk \nrelapsed FHWT  (those receiving 2 drugs at initial treatment without RT)  \nand the use of regimen ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, \netoposide) /cyclophosphamide/ topotecan) in patients with high - and very -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:39 PM.

In cancer \nsurvivorship cohorts, with patients surviving many decades after diagnosis \nof WT, it has been shown that patients treated with historic regimens have \nan increased incidence (65%) of chronic health problems,  and, 25 years \nafter treatment,  the incidence of severe conditions was  found to be  24%.76 \nWhile a complete overview of all of the potential late effects that a patient with WT may experience is outside the scope of these Guidelines, the \nPanel has noted some general statements based on therapy type that \nshould be considered. Related to chemothe rapy, potential late effects are \ndependent on the regimen received. Peripheral neuropathy is common among all regimens , with cardiac toxicity and subsequent leukemia being  \nassociated with DD4A, regimen M or I, and revised regimen s UH- 1 and \nUH-2. Infertility is also a common late effect for regimen M , regimen I , \nrevised regimen UH -1, and revised regimen UH- 2, which should be \nconsidered in relation to the age of the patient.  The NCCN Panel \nrecommends referral for infertility risk/fertility preservation counseling for all patients treated with these chemotherapy  regimens as well as patients \nreceiving WAI .\n118,119 Patients treated with RT also have an increased risk \nfor second malignancies . Additional  effects of radiation are dependent on \nthe location in which the RT is received . The development of end- stage \nkidney  disease is among other long- term risks of both RT and surgery. \nThe risk of long- term kidney  failure after treatment is only 0.6% in most \npatients with unilateral FHWT.36 However, t he incidence of end- stage \nkidney  disease is higher (12%) in children with bilateral WT.36,120 -122 \nFurthermore , psychosocial, cognitive, and financial hardship should also \nbe considered in pediatric patients who  have had cancer . Please see \nFollow -up After Completion of Treatment and Monitoring for Late Effects  in \nthe algorithm for more detailed information.  Summary  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Wilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma) provide an \nevidence-  and consensus -based framework  for the  diagnosis, treatment, \nand management of FHWT and  anaplastic WT. Although 5-year survival \nrates for FHWT are high with many patients being cured with surgery \nand/or chemotherapy, survival rates for children with advanced diffuse \nanaplasia are still low, warranting the need for greater research into \ntherapeutic options for this particular disease subtype. Ongoing trials, such \nas AREN1921,  aim to further elucidate effective and less toxic \nchemotherapy options for patients with diffuse anaplastic WT . Additionally, \nthe open AREN2231 trial  aims to further refine risk stratification for \npatients with unilateral FHWT, seeking to reduce therapy toxicity for patients with excellent outcomes with current standard therapy, and to \nimprove survival through intensification for patients whose outcomes  \nremain poor with current standard therapy.  The NCCN Panel continues to \nencourage patients to participate  in well- designed clinical trials if \nappropriate and applicable.
