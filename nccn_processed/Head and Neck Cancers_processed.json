An \nadditional 2–3 doses can be added depending on clinical circumstances.\nc Suggest 44–50 Gy in sequentially planned IMRT or 54–63 Gy with IMRT dose painting technique (dependent on dose per fraction).\nd Principles of Systemic Therapy for Non-Nasopharyngeal Cancers (SYST-A).\ne Based on published data, concurrent systemic therapy/RT most commonly uses conventional fractionation at 2.0 Gy per fraction to a typical dose of 70 Gy in 7 \nweeks with single-agent cisplatin given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m2; 2–3 cycles of chemotherapy are used depending on the radiation fractionation scheme (RTOG \n0129) (Ang KK, et al. N Engl J Med 2010;363:24-35). When carboplatin and 5-FU are used, the recommended regimen is standard fractionation plus 3 cycles of \nchemotherapy (Bourhis J, et al. Lancet Oncol 2012;13:145-153). Other fraction sizes (eg, 1.8 Gy, conventional), multiagent chemotherapy, other dosing schedules of \ncisplatin, or altered fractionation with chemotherapy are efficacious, and there is no consensus on the optimal approach. In general, the use of concurrent systemic \ntherapy/RT carries a high toxicity burden; multiagent chemotherapy will likely further increase the toxicity burden. For any systemic therapy/RT approach, close \nattention should be paid to published reports for the specific chemotherapy agent, dose, and schedule of administration. Systemic therapy/R T should be performed by \nan experienced team and should include substantial supportive care. See Discussion .\n1 Eisbruch A, et al.

Clinical centers are recommended to ascertain concordance \nrate of p16 and direct HPV testing, as this may vary by region, if considering use of p16 IHC alone as a surrogate.\n• Distinguishing p16+ patients by HPV tumor status informs prognosis. Patients with p16+ and HPV+ tumors have an improved prognosis \ncompared to patients with p16+ and HPV-negative tumors.1\n• Direct HPV confirmatory tests include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RNA  in situ hybridization (ISH).\n• PCR may provide additional sensitivity while ISH provides increased specificity .2-5\n• Sufficient pathologic material for HPV testing can be obtained through FNA.5,6 \n• A small proportion of tumors at non-oropharyngeal sites (eg, paranasal sinus, oral cavity, larynx) are HPV-related. However, given the small \nproportion and lack of consistent evidence in support of prognostic significance, routine HPV testing or p16 testing of non-oropharyngeal \ncancers is not recommended. \n• Guidelines for testing are available from the College of American Pathologists.7\n• When using p16, the 70% cutoff with nuclear and cytoplasmic expression with at least moderate to strong intensity is recommended.7\nORPH-B1 Mehanna H, Taberna M, von Buchwald C, et al.

Human papillomavirus and survival of patients with oropharyngeal cancer. N Engl \nJ Med 2010;363:24-35). When carboplatin and 5-FU are used, the recommended regimen \nis standard fractionation plus 3 cycles of chemotherapy [Bourhis J, Sire C, Graf f P, et \nal. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy versus acceleration of radiotherapy with or without \nconcomitant chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma (GORTEC 99-02): \nan open-label phase 3 randomised trial. Lancet Oncol 2012;13:145-153]. Other fraction sizes \n(eg, 1.8 Gy, conventional), multiagent chemotherapy, other dosing schedules of cisplatin, \nor altered fractionation with chemotherapy are efficacious, and there is no consensus on \nthe optimal approach. In general, the use of concurrent systemic therapy/RT carries a high \ntoxicity burden; multiagent chemotherapy will likely further increase the toxicity burden. For \nany systemic therapy/RT approach, close attention should be paid to published reports for \nthe specific chemotherapy agent, dose, and schedule of administration. Systemic therapy/\nRT should be performed by an experienced team and should include substantial supportive \ncare.DEFINITIVE : \nRT Alone\n• PTV\n\u0017High risk: Primary tumor and involved lymph nodes [this includes possible local subclinical infiltration at the primary site  \nand at the high-risk level lymph node(s)]\n ◊Fractionation: \n –66 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) to 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction); daily Monday–Friday in 6–7 weeksc,1 \n –69.96 Gy (2.12 Gy/fraction) daily Monday–Friday in 6–7 weeks\n –Concomitant boost accelerated RT: \n ▪72 Gy/6 weeks (1.8 Gy/fraction, large field; 1.5 Gy boost as second daily fraction during last 12 treatment days)\n ▪66–70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction; 6 fractions/wk accelerated)\n –Hyperfractionation: 81.6 Gy/7 weeks (1.2 Gy/fraction, twice daily)\n\u0017Low to intermediate risk: Sites of suspected subclinical spread\n ◊44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 54–63 Gy (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction)d\nCONCURRENT SYSTEMIC THERAPY/RT :e,f \n• PTV\n\u0017High risk: Typically 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction)\n\u0017Low to intermediate risk: 44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 54–63 Gy (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction)d\nIMRT (preferred)  is recommended.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Human papillomavirus and \nsurvival of patients with oropharyngeal cancer. N Engl J Med 2010;363:24-35). \nWhen carboplatin and 5-FU are used, then the recommended regimen is standard \nfractionation plus 3 cycles of chemotherapy [Bourhis J, Sire C, Graff P, et al. \nConcomitant chemoradiotherapy versus acceleration of radiotherapy with or \nwithout concomitant chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma \n(GORTEC 99-02): an open-label phase 3 randomised trial. Lancet Oncol \n2012;13:145-153]. Other fraction sizes (eg, 1.8 Gy, conventional), multiagent \nchemotherapy, other dosing schedules of cisplatin, or altered fractionation \nwith chemotherapy are efficacious, and there is no consensus on the optimal \napproach. In general, the use of concurrent systemic therapy/RT carries a high \ntoxicity burden; multiagent chemotherapy will likely further increase the toxicity \nburden. For any systemic therapy/RT approach, close attention should be paid \nto published reports for the specific chemotherapy agent, dose, and schedule of \nadministration. Systemic therapy/RT should be performed by an experienced team \nand should include substantial supportive care.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

An \nadditional 2–3 doses can be added depending on clinical circumstances.\nd Suggest 44–50 Gy in sequentially planned IMRT or 54–63 Gy with IMRT dose painting technique (dependent on dose per fraction).\ne Principles of Systemic Therapy for Non-Nasopharyngeal Cancers (SYST-A).\nf Based on published data, concurrent systemic therapy/RT most commonly uses conventional fractionation at 2.0 Gy per fraction to a typical dose of 70 Gy in 7 weeks \nwith single-agent cisplatin given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m2; 2–3 cycles of chemotherapy are used depending on the radiation fractionation scheme (RTOG) (Ang \nKK, Harris J, Wheeler R, et al. Human papillomavirus and survival of patients with oropharyngeal cancer. N Engl J Med 2010;363:24-35). When carboplatin and \n5-FU are used, the recommended regimen is standard fractionation plus 3 cycles of chemotherapy [Bourhis J, Sire C, Graf f P, et al. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy \nversus acceleration of radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma (GORTEC 99-02): an open-label phase \n3 randomised trial. Lancet Oncol 2012;13:145-153]. Other fraction sizes (eg, 1.8 Gy , conventional), multiagent chemotherapy, other dosing schedules of cisplatin, or \naltered fractionation with chemotherapy are efficacious, and there is no consensus on the optimal approach. In general, the use of concurrent systemic therapy/RT \ncarries a high toxicity burden; multiagent chemotherapy will likely further increase the toxicity burden. For any systemic therapy/R T approach, close attention should \nbe paid to published reports for the specific chemotherapy agent, dose, and schedule of administration. Systemic therapy/RT should be performed by an experienced \nteam and should include substantial supportive care.PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPYa\nDEFINITIVE :\nRT Alone\n• T1–3,N0–1: 66–70 Gy conventional (2.0 Gy/fraction)b\n• PTV\n\u0017High risk: Primary tumor and involved lymph nodes [this includes \npossible local subclinical infiltration at the primary site and at the high-\nrisk level lymph node(s)] \n ◊Fractionation: 66 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) to 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction); daily \nMonday–Friday in 6–7 weeksc\n ◊Concomitant boost accelerated RT: \n –72 Gy/6 weeks (1.8 Gy/fraction, large field; 1.5 Gy boost as second \ndaily fraction during last 12 treatment days)\n –66–70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction; 6 fractions/wk accelerated)\n ◊Hyperfractionation: 79.2–81.6 Gy/7 weeks (1.2 Gy/fraction twice daily)\n\u0017Low to intermediate risk: Sites of suspected subclinical spread\n ◊44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 54–63 Gy (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction)dCONCURRENT SYSTEMIC THERAPY/RT :e,f\n• PTV\n\u0017High risk: Typically 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction)\n\u0017Low to intermediate and low risk: 44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) \nto 54–63 Gy (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction)d\nIMRT (preferred) is recommended.

Human papillomavirus and survival of patients with \noropharyngeal cancer. N Engl J Med 2010;363:24-35). When carboplatin and 5-FU are used, then the recommended regimen is standard \nfractionation plus 3 cycles of chemotherapy [Bourhis J, Sire C, Graff P, et al. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy versus acceleration of \nradiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma (GORTEC 99-02): an open-label  \nphase 3 randomised trial. Lancet Oncol 2012;13:145-53]. Other fraction sizes (eg, 1.8 Gy, conventional), multiagent chemotherapy, other dosing \nschedules of cisplatin, or altered fractionation with chemotherapy are efficacious, and there is no consensus on the optimal approach.1 Data \nindicate that accelerated fractionation does not offer improved efficacy over conventional fractionation.2,3 In general, the use of concurrent \nsystemic therapy/RT carries a high toxicity burden; multiagent chemotherapy will likely further increase the toxicity burden. For any systemic \ntherapy/RT approach, close attention should be paid to published reports for the specific chemotherapy agent, dose, and schedule of \nadministration. Systemic therapy/RT should be performed by an experienced team and should include substantial supportive care.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

An \nadditional 2–3 doses can be added depending on clinical circumstances.\nd Suggest 44–50 Gy in sequentially planned IMRT or 54–63 Gy with IMRT dose painting technique (dependent on dose per fraction).\ne Principles of Systemic Therapy for Non-Nasopharyngeal Cancers (SYST-A).\nf Based on published data, concurrent systemic therapy/RT most commonly uses conventional fractionation at 2.0 Gy per fraction to a typical dose of 70 Gy in 7 weeks \nwith single-agent cisplatin given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/m2; 2–3 cycles of chemotherapy are used depending on the radiation fractionation scheme (RTOG 0129) \n(Ang KK, Harris J, Wheeler R, et al. Human papillomavirus and survival of patients with oropharyngeal cancer. N Engl J Med 2010;363:24-35). When carboplatin and \n5-FU are used, the recommended regimen is standard fractionation plus 3 cycles of chemotherapy [Bourhis J, Sire C, Graf f P, et al. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy \nversus acceleration of radiotherapy with or without concomitant chemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma (GORTEC 99-02): an open-label phase \n3 randomised trial. Lancet Oncol 2012;13:145-153]. Other fraction sizes (eg, 1.8 Gy , conventional), multiagent chemotherapy, other dosing schedules of cisplatin, or \naltered fractionation with chemotherapy are efficacious, and there is no consensus on the optimal approach. In general, the use of concurrent systemic therapy/RT \ncarries a high toxicity burden; multiagent chemotherapy will likely further increase the toxicity burden. For any systemic therapy/R T approach, close attention should \nbe paid to published reports for the specific chemotherapy agent, dose, and schedule of administration. Systemic therapy/RT should be performed by an experienced \nteam and should include substantial supportive care.PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPYa,b\nDEFINITIVE :\nRT Alone \n• PTV\n\u0017High risk: Involved lymph nodes [this includes possible local \nsubclinical infiltration at the high-risk level lymph node(s)]\n ◊Fractionation: \n –66 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) to 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction); daily \nMonday–Friday in 6–7 weeksc \n –Mucosal dosing: 50–66 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to putative \nmucosal sites, depending on field size.

When the goal of treatment is curative \nand surgery is not an option, reirradiation strategies can be considered for patients who: develop locoregional failures  or second primaries at ≥6 months after the initial \nradiotherapy; can receive additional doses of radiotherapy of at least 60 Gy; and can tolerate concurrent chemotherapy. OARs for toxicity should be carefully analyzed \nthrough review of dose-volume histograms, and consideration for acceptable doses should be made on the basis of time interval since original radiotherapy , anticipated \nvolumes to be included, and patient's life expectancy. For reirradiation dosing, see Principles of Radiation Techniques (RAD-A) . Proton therapy can be considered \nwhen normal tissue constraints cannot be met by photon-based therapy, or when photon-based therapy causes compromise of standard radiation dosing to tumor or \npostoperative volumes  (Takiar V, Garden AS, Ma D, et al. Reirradiation of head and neck cancers with intensity modulated radiation therapy: Outcomes and analyses. \nInt J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2016;95:1117-1131).\nd For doses >70 Gy, some clinicians feel that the fractionation should be slightly modified (eg, <2.0 Gy/fraction for at least some of the treatment) to minimize toxicity. An \nadditional 2–3 doses can be added depending on clinical circumstances.\ne Suggest 44–50 Gy in sequentially planned IMRT or 54–63 Gy with IMRT dose painting technique (dependent on dose per fraction).PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPYa,b,c\nDEFINITIVE :\nRT Alone or Concurrent Systemic Therapy/RT\n• Photon or photon/electron therapy or highly conformal RT techniques\n• PTV:\n\u0017High risk: Primary tumor and involved lymph nodes [this includes possible local subclinical infiltration at the primary and at the high-risk \nlevel lymph node(s)]   \n ◊Fractionation: 66 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 70–70.2 Gy (1.8–2.0 Gy/fraction); daily Monday–Friday in 6–8 weeksd \n\u0017Low to intermediate risk: Sites of suspected subclinical spread\n ◊44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 54–63 Gy (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction)e \nPOSTOPERATIVE RT :\nRT Alone or Concurrent Systemic Therapy/RT\n• Preferred interval between resection and postoperative RT is ≤6 weeks\n• Photon or photon/electron therapy\n• PTV\n\u0017High risk: Adverse pathologic features such as positive margins (SALI-3)\n ◊60–66 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction); daily Monday–Friday in 6–7 weeks\n\u0017Low to intermediate risk: Sites of suspected subclinical spread\n ◊44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 54–63 Gy (1.6–1.8 Gy/fraction)e\nIMRT (preferred) is recommended.

The proper selection and utilization of imaging \nstudies is critical in caring for patients with head and neck cancer.  \n• CT is performed with contrast. CT imaging of the chest can be performed with or without contrast, as clinically indicated. MRI is performed \nwith and without contrast, unless contraindicated.\nInitial Workup\n• Primary Site:\n\u0017Imaging assessment of primary site can be performed with CT of the soft tissues of the neck or MRI of the neck.  \n\u0017CT is complementary to MRI for head and neck cancers:\n ◊ To evaluate cortical bone erosion or periosteal invasion\n ◊ To evaluate cartilage invasion\n ◊ To evaluate bony erosion/destruction\n\u0017MRI is preferred over CT for the following conditions: \n ◊If there is a need to evaluate the extent of bone marrow invasion or in patients with extensive dental amalgam that may obscure the \nanatomy on CT\n ◊To assess skull base invasion and cranial nerve involvement\n ◊To evaluate skull base or intracranial or orbital invasion, and to differentiate tumor from obstructed sinuses\n ◊If there are cranial nerve symptoms or if radiographic perineural tumor spread is a possibility\n\u0017To achieve complete evaluation of the primary and any nodal disease, CT or MRI of the neck should image the anatomy from the skull base \nto the thoracic inlet. For certain conditions, such as involved lymph nodes in the low neck or cancers that frequently involve the upper \nmediastinum (such as thyroid cancer), the imaging should extend to the carina.\n\u0017If imaging does not reveal an obvious primary, PET/CT should be ordered before EUA, biopsies, and tonsillectomy to help identify potential \nprimary sites before any intervention occurs. In addition, FNA biopsy of metastatic nodes may be pathologically informative. Image-\nguided (ultrasound [US] or CT) needle biopsy of cystic neck nodes may offer better diagnostic yield than FNA  by palpation alone for initial \ndiagnosis in this setting. \n\u0017Panoramic dental x-ray is recommended for oral cavity cancers requiring mandibulotomy and/or mandibulectomy. When postoperative RT \nis anticipated (including such sites as the lip, other oral cavity subsites, or the oropharynx), panoramic x-ray is part of a comprehensive \npre-radiation dental evaluation to assess the health of the affected dentition and determine if pre-radiation dental procedures or extractions \nare needed. \nContinuedPRINCIPLES OF IMAGINGPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Similarly , patients who are scheduled for a definitive \nRT approach may benefit from the higher sensitivity of FDG-PET/CT for identifying involved lymph nodes.\n• Distant Metastases\n\u0017For patients with locoregionally advanced cancer (eg, T3–T4 primary or ≥N1 nodal staging), FDG-PET/CTa is preferred to evaluate for \ndistant disease and thoracic metastases. However, FDG-PET/CT cannot rule out brain metastasis, and for cancers where this is a concern, \nsuch as mucosal melanoma or high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas or adenocarcinomas, contrast-enhanced brain MRI should be \nadditionally obtained.\n\u0017If FDG-PET/CT is not performed, CT of the chest should be performed to assess for presence of pulmonary metastases as well as \nmediastinal lymph node involvement.\n\u0017Non-contrast CT of the chest can be sufficient to screen for lung parenchymal metastases but is not adequate for assessment of \nmediastinal adenopathy. This is an appropriate lung cancer screening intervention for patients with a history of smoking. See NCCN \nGuidelines for Lung Cancer Screening . \n\u0017Following primary definitive treatment (surgery, RT, or systemic therapy/RT) the role of annual CT screening for lung metastasis is \ncontroversial. While this approach does detect early metastasis, further study is needed to determine the extent of the positive effect and/\nor cost-effectiveness of this approach in specific subpopulations and timepoints post-treatment. For patients with a substantial smoking \nhistory or who are at high risk for lung metastases, annual chest CT can be considered. Historically, annual chest x-ray has been obtained \nbut this is a much less sensitive test than CT.\n\u0017If clinical concern for metastatic disease is confined to a specific anatomical area, the assessment of distant disease can be performed \nwith directed CT or MRI examination. For example, pulmonary metastasis can be followed and assessed by non-contrast chest CT, or spinal \nmetastasis can be followed and assessed by contrast-enhanced spine MRI. The frequency of such imaging tests depends on the planned \ntreatment regimen and type of cancer. \n\u0017FDG-PET/CT may complement or replace other imaging modalities when staging recurrent disease before any therapy for relapsed/\nrefractory disease in order to explore distant disease or second primaries that may significantly impact choice of therapy .1\nContinuedPRINCIPLES OF IMAGING\na PET/CT is preferred over PET scan alone (ie, without superimposed CT scan).

US of the neck for targeted sampling of any suspicious tissues may also be helpful, but \nresults can be variably interpreted depending on the specific clinical situation.\n• FDG-PET/CT should be performed within 3–6 months of definitive radiation or systemic therapy/RT for assessment of treatment response \nand to identify any residual tumor2-5\n\u0017Early FDG-PET/CT scans before 12 weeks are associated with significant false-positive rates and should be avoided in the absence of \nsigns of recurrence or progression.\n\u0017The optimal timing of PET scans after radiation treatment appears to be at the 3- to 6-month window.2,3 A negative PET at this time point \npredicts improved overall survival at 2 years.\n\u0017In patients receiving definitive RT-based treatment of mucosal squamous cell carcinoma with AJCC 7th edition N2–N3 nodal disease, \nthe FDG-PET/CT surveillance approach led to fewer neck dissections and considerable cost savings compared to a routine approach of \nplanned post-treatment neck dissection. The majority of cases studied were p16-positive oropharyngeal cancers.4 \n• In the special case of patients who are treated initially with induction chemotherapy prior to the initiation of definitive therapy , either CT or \nMRI has typically been obtained after 2–3 cycles of induction. Chest CT and/or FDG-PET/CT (with diagnostic-quality imaging of the regions \nof the body at risk) may be obtained if there is concern for locoregional or distant metastatic progression.PRINCIPLES OF IMAGING\n2 Cheung PK, Chin RY, Eslick GD.

Surveillance can be challenging because of \naltered anatomy and/or fibrosis from surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. There are no consensus guidelines on the frequency and \nmodality of routine post-treatment imaging in the asymptomatic patient. Practice varies widely across institutions. \n• US, CT, MRI, and PET/CT all have unique advantages and disadvantages when used as surveillance imaging. There is evidence that FDG-\nPET/CT may be the most sensitive of these modalities. A 12-month PET has been shown to reveal recurrent or second primary cancers in \napproximately 10% of treated patients; a 24-month FDG-PET/CT imaging revealed these findings in approximately 5% of treated cases.3 Most \ncases of asymptomatic FDG-PET/CT lesion localization occur at distant sites.6 Whether earlier detection leads to improved disease-specific \nsurvival is not established.\n• Standardized multi-institutional imaging-based trials are needed to clearly elucidate the value of routine imaging in the clinically \nasymptomatic patient. There may be little proven benefit in further imaging if the initial 3-month FDG-PET/CT scan was negative. Ho et al \nreported no significant difference in 3-year disease-free survival in patients undergoing imaging surveillance versus those only receiving \nclinical surveillance (41% vs. 46%, P = .91) in this setting.7\n• If an FDG-PET/CT at 3 months post-treatment is negative, there are no data to support substantial benefit for further routine imaging in an \nasymptomatic patient with negative exam. In the absence of multi-institutional prospective data, a tailored approach to surveillance with \nattention to tumor type, stage, prognostic factors, symptomatology, and physical exam changes or restrictions is appropriate.\n• US of the neck is a well-established tool for nodal surveillance. US is generally widely available, safe, fast, inexpensive, and an accurate \nmodality for examination of the neck for any suspicious nodal disease.8\n• Additional post-treatment imaging is indicated for worrisome or equivocal signs/symptoms. \n• Routine annual imaging (repeat use of pretreatment imaging modality) may be indicated to visualize areas inaccessible to routine clinical \nexamination (deep-seated anatomic locations or areas obscured by extensive treatment change).PRINCIPLES OF IMAGING\n3 Heineman TE, Kuan EC, St John MA.

In the setting of metastatic carcinoma to the neck an EUA to search for the putative primary site is \nimportant for diagnosis and treatment planning.\n• Participate in the multidisciplinary team discussions regarding patient treatment options with the goal of maximizing survival with \npreservation of form and function.\n• Develop a prospective surveillance plan that includes adequate dental, nutritional, and health behavioral evaluation and intervention and any \nother ancillary evaluations that would provide for comprehensive rehabilitation.\nIntegration of Therapy\n• It is critical that multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment be coordinated and integrated prospectively by all disciplines involved in patient \ncare before the initiation of any treatment.\n• For patients undergoing an operation, the surgical procedure, margins, and reconstructive plan should be developed and designed to resect \nall gross tumors with adequate tumor-free surgical margins. The surgical procedure should rarely be modified based on any response \nobserved as a result of prior therapy except in instances of tumor progression that mandate a more extensive procedure in order to \nencompass the tumor at the time of definitive resection. \n• Once the multidisciplinary team has established a proposed treatment regimen, the responsible physician and a member of the team should \ndiscuss the recommendations in detail with the patient to include the risks, benefits, and potential outcomes.

Commonly, the primary is \nsmall and asymptomatic and may not be detectable on inspection, palpation, fiberoptic examination, or imaging of the oropharynx. It is \nincumbent upon the treating physician or surgeon to diligently search for and pathologically confirm the primary site, which is usually \nlocated in the base of tongue or tonsil.  \n• Information obtained from a thorough workup evaluation is vital to enable the multidisciplinary team to develop a comprehensive and \nfocused treatment plan individualized to the patient. Identification of the primary site will either permit definitive transoral surgery to remove \nthe primary disease or permit focused radiation, thus sparing adjacent sites in the oropharynx. As therapy becomes more personalized, \nbiomarker assessment of the primary tumor may be instrumental in determining a patient’s eligibility for a clinical trial or adjuvant therapy. \n• Cross-sectional imaging should be performed to facilitate identification of the primary site, followed by direct examination and confirmatory \nbiopsies. \n• EUA and confirmatory biopsies for patients with suspected OPSCC should be performed before beginning therapy. EUA may entail unilateral \nor bilateral biopsies of suspicious areas in the oropharynx. Palatine tonsillectomies may reveal a small primary tumor. Lingual tonsillectomy \nmay be considered if biopsies and palatine tonsils are negative for tumor. Bilateral palatine and lingual tonsillectomies are ill-advised as they \nmay lead to swallowing morbidity.\n• FNA biopsy of the neck mass, often performed under US guidance, will usually establish the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma. A definitive \ncytologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is highly accurate, and further assessment of immunostaining for p16 can support the \ndiagnosis of HPV-associated OPSCC in the presence of an oropharyngeal primary tumor. See Principles of p16 Testing for HPV-Mediated \nOropharyngeal Cancer (ORPH-B). If there is any uncertainty, a core biopsy under image guidance can be performed. Rarely is an open \nexcisional biopsy of the suspected metastatic node necessary for definitive diagnosis. The surgeon should be prepared to perform a neck \ndissection at the time of open biopsy if frozen section confirms squamous cell carcinoma. In select occult primary cases with p16-positive \nnodal metastasis, confirmation with HPV ISH/PCR testing is recommended.\nAssessment of Resectability  \nTumor involvement of the following sites is associated with poor prognosis or functiona or with T4b cancer (ie, unresectable based on \ntechnical ability to obtain clear margins). None of these sites of involvement is an absolute contraindication to resection in selected patients \nin whom total cancer removal is possible:\n• Involvement of the pterygoid muscles, particularly when associated with severe trismus or pterygopalatine fossa involvement with cranial \nneuropathy;a\n• Gross extension of the tumor to the skull base (eg, erosion of the pterygoid plates or sphenoid bone, widening of the foramen ovale);\n• Direct extension to the superior nasopharynx or deep extension into the Eustachian tube and lateral nasopharyngeal walls;\n• Invasion (encasement) of the common or internal carotid artery; \n• Direct extension of neck disease to involve the external skin;a\n• Direct extension to mediastinal structures, prevertebral fascia, or cervical vertebrae; anda\n• Presence of subdermal metastases.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY\nSURG-A\n2 OF 9a In selected cases, surgery might still be considered.ContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

The primary tumor should \nbe considered surgically curable by appropriate resection using \naccepted criteria for adequate excision, depending on the region \ninvolved. \n• En bloc resection of the primary tumor should be attempted \nwhenever feasible.  \n• In-continuity neck dissection is necessary when there is direct \nextension of the primary tumor into the neck.  \n• Resection should be planned based on the extent of the primary \ntumor as ascertained by clinical examination and careful \ninterpretation of appropriate radiographic images.  \n• For oral cavity cancers, as depth of invasion increases, the risk \nof regional metastases and the need for adjuvant elective neck \ndissection also increases. \n• Perineural invasion should be suspected when tumors are adjacent \nto motor or sensory nerves. The goal is total cancer resection. \nWhen gross invasion is present and the nerve can be resected \nwithout significant morbidity, the nerve should be dissected both \nproximally and distally and should be resected to obtain clearance \nof disease (Surgical Management of Cranial Nerves [SURG-A, 5 of \n9]). Frozen section determination of the proximal and distal nerve \nmargins may prove helpful to facilitate tumor clearance.  \n• Partial or segmental resection of the mandible may be necessary \nto adequately encompass the cancer with adequate tumor-free \nmargins. Adequate resection may require partial, horizontal, or \nsagittal resection of the mandible for tumors involving or adherent \nto mandibular periosteum. Segmental or marginal resection \nshould be considered in tumors that grossly involve mandibular \nperiosteum (as determined by tumor fixation to the mandible) or \nshow evidence of direct tumor involvement of the bone at the \ntime of operation or through preoperative imaging (CT or MRI). \nA Panorex may be useful for assessing mandibular height when \nContinuedPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY\na marginal or coronal mandibulectomy is a consideration. In the \nedentulous patient due to mandibular atrophy that occurs over time, a \npartial mandibulectomy may not be possible. The extent of mandibular \nresection will depend on the degree of involvement accessed clinically \nand in the operating room.  \n• Medullary space invasion is an indication for segmental resection. \nFrozen section examination of available marrow may be considered to \nguide resection.\n• For tumors of the larynx, the decision to perform either total \nlaryngectomy or conservation laryngeal surgery (eg, transoral \nresection, hemilaryngectomy, supracricoid partial laryngectomy, \nsupraglottic laryngectomy) will be decided by the surgeon and \nthe patient but should adhere to the principles of complete tumor \nextirpation with curative intent and function preservation. Partial \nlaryngeal surgery should be avoided if adjuvant RT is likely following \nsurgery. For T4 or N2–3 laryngeal cancers treated with surgery, \nconsideration should be given to thyroidectomy for tumor clearance \nand clearance of central compartment pretracheal or paratracheal \nnodes.\n• Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) or laser-assisted resections of \nprimary cancers of the larynx and pharynx are increasingly used \napproaches for cancer resection in selected patients with accessible \ntumors. Oncologic principles are similar to open procedures. \nSuccessful application of these techniques requires specialized \nskills and experience. Postoperative hemorrhage can be a major and \nrarely life-threatening complication. It is incumbent upon the TORS \nsurgeon to use appropriate surgical strategies to diminish the risk of \npostoperative hemorrhage.\n• In oropharyngeal cancer cases (whether HPV positive or negative) \ntreatment selection should favor usage of fewest modalities necessary \nin order to minimize treatment-related toxicity and preserve function. \nAvoid triple modality treatment when possible. Patients with fixed \nnodes are not appropriate candidates for upfront definitive surgery .PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Margin assessment \nmay be done in real time by frozen section or by assessment \nof formalin-fixed tissues. Tumor-free margins are an essential \nsurgical strategy for diminishing the risk for local tumor recurrence. \nConversely, positive margins increase the risk for local relapse and are \nan indication for postoperative adjuvant therapy. Clinical pathologic \nstudies have demonstrated the significance of close or positive \nmargins and their relationship with local tumor recurrence.1 When \nthere is an initial cut-through with an invasive tumor at the surgical \nmargin, obtaining additional adjacent margins from the patient may \nalso be associated with a higher risk for local relapse and should \nbe described in the operative report. Obtaining additional margins \nfrom the patient is subject to ambiguity regarding whether the tissue \ntaken from the surgical bed corresponds to the actual site of margin \npositivity.2 If positive surgical margins are reported, re-resection and/\nor adjuvant therapy should be considered in selected patients.\nFrozen section margin assessment is always at the discretion of the \nsurgeon and should be considered when it will facilitate complete \ntumor removal. The achievement of adequate wide margins may \nrequire resection of an adjacent structure in the oral cavity or \nlaryngopharynx such as the base of the tongue and/or anterior tongue, \nmandible, larynx, or portions of the cervical esophagus. \n• Adequate resection is defined as clear resection margins with at least \nenough clearance from the gross tumor to obtain clear frozen section \nand permanent margins (often 1.0–1.5 cm of visible and palpable \nnormal mucosa). However, for glottic cancers, a 1- to 2-mm margin is \nconsidered adequate. In general, frozen section examination of the \nmargins will usually be undertaken intraoperatively, and, importantly, \nwhen a line of resection has uncertain clearance because of indistinct \ntumor margins, or there is suspected residual disease (ie, soft tissue, \ncartilage, carotid artery, mucosal irregularity). In transoral endoscopic \nand robotic approaches for oropharynx cancers, margins of 1.5–2.0 \nmm may be acceptable, but the data are based on retrospective \nstudies and caution is indicated.3 Such margins would be considered \n“close” and are inadequate for certain sites such as oral tongue.  \nContinuedPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY\n• The details of resection margins should be included in the operative \ndictation. The margins may be assessed on the resected specimen or \nalternatively from the surgical bed with proper orientation. Adequacy of \nthe margins may vary by site. For a glottic cancer 1- to 2-mm margins are \nsufficient but inadequate for an invasive carcinoma of the oral tongue.  \n• At this time there is no universal definition for what constitutes a clear/\nclose margin.\n• Distance in mm to achieve clinically acceptable margins is influenced by \ntumor primary site, histology, and HPV status in oropharyngeal cancer \nand following neoadjuvant therapy.\n• The previous universally followed definition of adequate margin (5 mm in \nfinal histopathology) has been disputed.4,5\n• A positive margin is defined as carcinoma in situ or as invasive \ncarcinoma at the margin of resection. If carcinoma in situ is present \nand if additional margins can be obtained that is the favored approach. \nCarcinoma in situ should not be considered an indication for concurrent \npostoperative systemic therapy/RT.\n• The primary tumor should be marked in a fashion adequate for \norientation by the surgical pathologist. The primary tumor should be \nassessed histologically for depth of invasion and for distance from the \ninvasive portion of the tumor to the margin of resection, including the \nperipheral and deep margins. The pathology report should be template-\ndriven and describe how the margins were assessed. The report should \nprovide information regarding the primary specimen to include the \ndistance from the invasive portion of the tumor to the peripheral and \ndeep margin. If the surgeon obtains additional margins from the patient, \nthe new margins should refer back to the geometric orientation of the \nresected tumor specimen with a statement by the pathologist that this is \nthe final margin of resection and its histologic status. \n• The neck dissection should be oriented or sectioned in order to identify \nlevels of lymph nodes encompassed in the dissection. \n• Reconstruction of surgical defects should be performed using \nconventional techniques at the discretion of the surgeon. Primary \nclosure is recommended when appropriate but should not be pursued \nat the expense of obtaining wide, tumor-free margins. Reconstructive \nclosure with locoregional flaps, free-tissue transfer, or split-thickness \nskin or other grafts with or without mandibular reconstruction is \nperformed at the discretion of the surgeon. To improve efficiency and \naddress both oncologic and reconstructive goals, a two-team approach \nis advisable.

These guidelines apply \nto the performance of neck dissections as part of treatment of the \nprimary tumor. In general, patients undergoing surgery for resection \nof the primary tumor will undergo dissection of the ipsilateral side of \nthe neck that is at greatest risk for metastases. \n• Tumor sites that frequently have bilateral lymphatic drainage \n(eg, base of tongue, palate, supraglottic larynx, hypopharynx, \nnasopharynx, deep pre-epiglottic space involvement) often should \nhave both sides of the neck dissected with the extent of dissection \ndetermined as suggested below. For those patients with tumors at \nor approaching the midline, both sides of the neck are at risk for \nmetastases, and bilateral neck dissections should be performed.\nPatients with advanced lesions involving the anterior tongue, floor \nof the mouth, or alveolus that approximate or cross the midline \nshould undergo contralateral selective/modified neck dissection as \nnecessary to achieve adequate tumor resection. \n• Elective neck dissection should be based on risk of occult \nmetastasis in the appropriate nodal basin. For oral cavity squamous \ncell carcinoma, SLN biopsy or the primary tumor depth of invasion \nis currently the best predictor of occult metastatic disease and \nshould be used to guide decision-making. For tumors with a depth \n>3 mm, elective dissection should be strongly considered if RT is \nnot already planned. Recent randomized trial evidence supports the \neffectiveness of elective neck dissection in patients with oral cavity \ncancers >3 mm in depth of invasion.6 For a depth <2 mm, elective \ndissection is only indicated in highly selective situations. For a \ndepth of 2–4 mm, clinical judgment (as to reliability of follow-up, \nclinical suspicion, and other factors) must be utilized to determine \nappropriateness of elective dissection. Elective dissections are \ngenerally selective, preserving all major structures, unless operative \nfindings dictate otherwise.\nContinuedPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY\n• The type of neck dissection (comprehensive or selective) is defined \naccording to preoperative clinical staging, is determined at the \ndiscretion of the surgeon, and is based on the initial preoperative \nstaging as follows: \nN0 Selective neck dissection\n• Oral cavity at least levels I–III \n• Oropharynx at least levels II–IV \n• Hypopharynx at least levels II–IV and level VI \nwhen appropriate\n• Larynx at least levels II–IV and level VI when \nappropriate\nN1–N2a–c Selective or comprehensive neck dissection  \n(Discussion)\nN3 Comprehensive neck dissection\n• Level VI neck dissections are performed for certain primary sites \n(such as the larynx and hypopharynx) as required to resect the \nprimary tumor and any clinically evident neck nodes. Elective \ndissection depends on primary tumor extent and site. For advanced \nglottic and hypopharyngeal cancers treated with primary surgery, a \nlevel VI dissection (including pretracheal lymph nodes, the Delphian \nlymph node, and unilateral or bilateral paratracheal lymph nodes) \nand hemithyroidectomy to total thyroidectomy are appropriate. \nFor primary subglottic tumors or glottic cancers with significant \nsubglottic extension, a level VI dissection with unilateral or total \nthyroidectomy is considered appropriate based on the extent of \nthe primary tumor. For example, a T4a glottic tumor with extension \nthrough the cricothyroid membrane and subglottic extension \nshould include thyroidectomy and pretracheal and bilateral \nparatracheal lymph node dissection. Parathyroid glands should be \npreserved in situ or auto transplanted as indicated.

Technical experience and judgment are required for successful \nexecution of lymphatic mapping and SLN. Its advantages include reduced morbidity and an improved cosmetic outcome. Rates of detection \nof sentinel nodes in excess of 95% have been widely reported.7-9 Patients with metastatic disease in their sentinel nodes must undergo \na completion neck dissection while those without may be observed. Accuracy of sentinel node biopsy for nodal staging of early oral \ncarcinoma has been tested extensively in multiple single-center studies and two multi-institutional trials against the reference standard \nof immediately performed neck dissection or subsequent extended follow-up with a pooled estimate of sensitivity of 0.93 and negative \npredictive values ranging from 0.88 to 1.6,8-12 While direct comparisons with the policy of elective neck dissection are lacking, available \nevidence points towards comparable survival outcomes.6 \n• Sentinel node biopsy is a technically demanding procedure. Procedural success rates for sentinel node identification as well as accuracy \nof detecting occult lymphatic metastasis depend on technical expertise and experience. Hence, sufficient caution must be exercised when \noffering it as an alternative to elective neck dissection. This is particularly true in cases of floor-of-mouth cancer where accuracy of sentinel \nnode biopsy has been found to be lower than for other locations such as the tongue.6,7 Also, cancers of certain locations such as upper \ngingiva and hard palate may not lend themselves well technically to this procedure. Likewise, occult cervical metastases are uncommon \nin early lip cancer, but SLN biopsy has been shown to be feasible and effective in patients with lip cancers deemed to be at high risk of \nmetastases generally based on tumor size or depth.13\nPalliative Surgery\n• Curative treatment of head and neck cancers can lead to unwanted side effects such as scarring and stiffness of soft tissues, soft tissue \nand bone necrosis, chronic infection and tissue breakdown, pain, dysphagia, and aspiration pneumonia. These ill effects are challenging \nto manage and treat. Persistent cancer or recurrent disease can further complicate management. Concurrent palliative care for symptom \nmanagement is necessary to support quality of life during and following treatment. Examples of such include tracheostomy for insufficient \nairway and respiratory distress, and gastrostomy for nutritional support in patients with dysphagia and aspiration risk. There may be a \nneed for surgical removal of damaged and dysfunctional tissues and necessary defect reconstruction with transfer of healthy vascularized \ntissues to promote healing. Examples of surgery for symptom palliation include mandibulectomy for osteoradionecrosis of the mandible \nand reconstruction with osteocutaneous microvascular free-flap and/or functional laryngectomy and pharyngoplasty for a dysfunctional \nlarynx with significant aspiration following radiation-based larynx preservation treatment. It is imperative to assess patients with head and \nneck cancer through the entire cancer diagnosis and treatment continuum for functional capacity and quality of life. Judicious surgical \ninterventions may play a critical role in symptom palliation and wellness through both survivorship and end of life.\nContinuedPRINCIPLES OF SURGERYPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Standards for target definition, dose specification, fractionation (with and without concurrent chemotherapy), and normal \ntissue constraints are still evolving. Published contouring guidelines referenced are in regard to patients who have not been operated upon.10,11\n\u0017IMRT (preferred) or other conformal techniques (helical tomotherapy, volumetric modulated arc therapy [VMAT], and proton beam therapy \n[PBT]) may be used as appropriate depending on the stage, tumor location, physician training/experience, and available physics support.a \n\u0017Close interplay exists between radiation technology, techniques, fractionation, cumulative radiation dose, surgery, and chemotherapy \noptions resulting in a large number of combinations that may impact toxicity or tumor control. \n\u0017FDG-PET/CT or MRI with contrast can be used for fusion in treatment planning. \n• Advanced RT technologies such as IMRT (preferred), tomotherapy, VMAT, image-guided RT (IGRT), and PBT may offer clinically relevant \nadvantages in specific instances to spare important organs at risk (OARs), such as the brain, brain stem, cochlea, semicircular canals, \noptic chiasm and cranial nerves, retina, lacrimal glands, cornea, spinal cord, brachial plexus, mucosa, salivary glands, bone (skull base and \nmandible), pharyngeal constrictors, larynx, and esophagus, and decrease the risk for late, normal tissue damage while still achieving the \nprimary goal of local tumor control. \n\u0017The demonstration of clinically significant dose-sparing of these OARs reflects best clinical practice. \n• Since the advantages of these techniques include tightly conformal doses and steep gradients next to normal tissues, target definition \nand delineation and treatment delivery verification require careful monitoring to avoid the risk of tumor geographic miss and subsequent \ndecrease in local tumor control. \n\u0017Initial diagnostic imaging with contrast-enhanced CT, MRI, FDG-PET/CT, and other imaging modalities facilitate target definition.  \n• Image guidance is required to provide assurance of accurate daily delivery. Anatomical changes including rapidly shrinking tumors, changes \nin air cavities, or significant weight loss may necessitate repeat diagnostic imaging and replanning (adaptive treatment).\n• Randomized studies to test these concepts are unlikely to be done since the above specific clinical scenarios represent complex \ncombinations of multiple variables. In light of that, the modalities and techniques that are found best to reduce the doses to the clinically \nrelevant OARs without compromising target coverage should be considered.\na For additional resources regarding the technical details of radiation, see the American College of Radiology Guidelines:  \nhttps://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/Practice-Parameters-and-Technical-Standards .

IMRT is \npreferred for thyroid cancers because of its ability to spare the larynx, brachial plexus, and esophagus. \n\u0017The application of IMRT to other sites (eg, oral cavity, larynx, hypopharynx) is preferred and may be used at the discretion of treating \nphysicians. \n\u0017Helical tomotherapy and VMAT are advanced forms of IMRT.\n• PBT12-32\n\u0017Achieving highly conformal dose distributions is especially important for patients: 1) whose primary tumors are periocular in location \nand/or invade the orbit, skull base, and/or cavernous sinus; 2) whose primary tumors extend intracranially or exhibit extensive perineural \ninvasion; and 3) who are being treated with curative intent and/or who have long life expectancies following treatment. Nonrandomized, \nsingle-institution, clinical reports and systematic comparisons demonstrate safety and efficacy of PBT in the above-mentioned specific \nclinical scenarios.\n\u0017Proton therapy can be considered when normal tissue constraints cannot be met by photon-based therapy, or when photon-based therapy \ncauses compromise of standard radiation dosing to tumor or postoperative volumes.\n• IMRT, PBT, and Fractionation33-35\n\u0017A number of ways exist to integrate IMRT or PBT, target volume dosing, and fractionation. \n ◊The SIB technique uses differential “dose painting” (66–72 Gy to gross disease; 44–63 Gy to subclinical disease) for each fraction of \ntreatment throughout the entire course of radiation.4 SIB is commonly used in the conventional (5 fractions/wk) and the “6 fractions/wk \naccelerated” schedule.5 \n ◊The sequential (SEQ) technique typically delivers the initial (lower dose) phase (weeks 1–5) followed by the high-dose boost volume \nphase (weeks 6–7) using 2–3 separate dose plans, and is commonly applied in standard fractionation and hyperfractionation. \n ◊The concomitant boost accelerated schedule may utilize a “modified SEQ” dose plan by delivering the dose to the subclinical targets \nonce a day for 6 weeks, and a separate boost dose plan as a second daily fraction for the last 12 treatment days.6\n ◊Another accelerated approach, aside from concomitant boost, is to simply treat 6 fractions per week.5\n\u0017Altered fractionation may be used for select patients with comorbidities who are not good candidates for 6–7 weeks of adjuvant RT or \nsystemic therapy/RT.\n\u0017Altered fractionation has not proven to be beneficial in the context of concurrent chemotherapy . The best available evidence is that the \nbenefit of accelerated fractionation is specific to hyperfractionation, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.83 for overall survival. The benefit of other \nmethods of altered fractionation is not clearly advantageous on meta-analysis.36\na For additional resources regarding the technical details of radiation, see the American College of Radiology Guidelines:  \nhttps://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/Practice-Parameters-and-Technical-Standards .

For those who are either medically unsuitable \nfor standard RT or who have widely metastatic disease, palliative RT should be considered for relief or prevention of locoregional \nsymptoms if the RT toxicities are acceptable. RT regimens should be tailored individually; severe RT toxicities should be avoided when \ntreatment is for palliation. \n\u0017Some recommended RT regimens include:\n ◊50 Gy in 20 fractions;37\n ◊37.5 Gy in 15 fractions (if well tolerated, consider adding 5 additional fractions to 50 Gy);\n ◊30 Gy in 10 fractions;\n ◊30 Gy in 5 fractions:b give 2 fractions/wk with ≥3 days between the 2 treatments; and38\n ◊44.4 Gy in 12 fractions, in 3 cycles (for each cycle, give 2 fractions 6 hours apart for 2 days in a row; treatments must exclude the spinal \ncord after second cycle).39,40 Reassessment should be done at 1- to 3-week intervals.\n\u0017The use of shorter more hypofractionated treatment courses may be indicated, but the dose tolerance of the spinal cord and neural \nstructures must be evaluated carefully in light of fraction size.\n\u0017Carefully evaluate the patient’s PS, treatment tolerance, tumor response, and/or any systemic progression.

Patients who are >2 years from prior radiation, \nwho have surgery to remove gross disease prior to reirradiation, and who are free of organ dysfunction (eg, laryngectomy, feeding tube) \nhave better outcomes.54\n\u0017The incidence of myelopathy is thought to increase after a cumulative biologically effective dose (BED) of 120 Gy ,55 but this risk is \nincreased if large fraction sizes (≥2.5 Gy/fraction) are used.\n\u0017Radiation volumes should include known disease only to minimize the volume of tissue receiving very high doses in regions of overlap. \nProphylactic treatment of subclinical disease (eg, elective nodal irradiation) is therefore not routinely indicated. \n\u0017When using SBRT techniques for reirradiation, careful selection of patients is advised. The best outcomes are seen in patients with smaller \ntumors and no skin involvement. Caution should be exercised in cases of circumferential carotid artery involvement.\n\u0017Reirradiation dosing:\n ◊Conventional fractionation \n –Postoperative: 56–60 Gy at 1.8–2 Gy/fraction\n –Definitive: 66–70 Gy at 1.8–2 Gy/fraction\n ◊Accelerated fractionation: 60–70 Gy at 1.2–1.5 Gy/fraction twice daily\n ◊Hyperfractionation for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: IMRT total dose of 65 Gy, in 54 fractions, twice daily, with an \nirradiation interval of 6–8 hours56\n ◊Current SBRT schedules being used or investigated are in the range of 35–44 Gy using 5 fractions.\n ◊Clinical trials should be strongly considered for patients receiving reirradiation.\nContinuedPRINCIPLES OF RADIATION TECHNIQUESa\na For additional resources regarding the technical details of radiation, see the American College of Radiology Guidelines:  \nhttps://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/Practice-Parameters-and-Technical-Standards .PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Nutritional management is very important in patients with head and neck cancer to improve outcomes and to \nminimize significant temporary or permanent treatment-related complications (eg, severe weight loss). A registered dietitian and a speech \nlanguage/swallowing therapist should be part of the multidisciplinary team for treating patients with head and neck cancer throughout the \ncontinuum of care. \nContinuedAssessment and Management\n• Nutrition \n\u0017Close monitoring of nutritional status is recommended in patients \nwho have: 1) significant weight loss (5% weight loss over prior \n1 month, or 10% weight loss over 6 months); and/or 2) difficulty \nswallowing because of pain or tumor involvement prior to \ntreatment. All patients should be evaluated for nutritional risks \nand should receive nutrition counseling by a registered dietitian \nand/or indicated treatment with various nutrition interventions, \nsuch as feeding tubes (eg, nasogastric [NG] tubes, percutaneous \nendoscopic gastrostomy [PEG] tubes) or intravenous nutrition \nsupport (but only if enteral support is not feasible).\n\u0017Pre- and post-treatment functional evaluation including nutritional \nstatus should be undertaken using subjective and objective \nassessment tools. All patients should receive dietary counseling \nwith the initiation of treatment, especially with RT-based \ntreatments. Regular follow-up with the registered dietitian should \ncontinue at least until the patient has achieved a nutritionally \nstable baseline following treatment. For some patients with chronic \nnutritional challenges, this follow-up should be ongoing.\n• Speech and Swallowing \n\u0017A formal speech and swallowing evaluation at baseline is \nrecommended for either:\n1) patients with speech and/or swallowing dysfunction; or \n2) patients whose treatment is likely to affect speech and/or \nswallowing. \n\u0017Baseline functional evaluation including oral health, dental health, \nand nutritional status should be undertaken using both subjective \nand objective assessment tools. All patients should receive dietary \ncounseling with initiation of treatment, especially with RT-based \ntreatments.\nReferences\u0017Interval reassessments during and after treatments into \nsurvivorship are important in order to palliate treatment-related \nside effects such as loss of appetite, mucositis, oral pain, \nxerostomia, loss of taste/smell, lymphedema, trismus, etc. that \nimpact patient's nutritional status and well-being.\n\u0017Patients with ongoing abnormal function should be seen \nregularly by speech-language pathologists. Dysphagia and \nswallowing function can be measured by clinical swallowing \nassessments, fiberoptic endoscopic swallowing evaluations, \nor videofluoroscopic swallowing studies. Patient evaluations \nshould also include assessment for any changes in speech and \ncommunication; changes in taste; and assessment for xerostomia, \npain, trismus, lymphedema, and fibrosis (see SLYMPH-A in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Survivorship ). Follow-up with the speech-\nlanguage pathologist should continue at least until the patient has \nachieved a stable baseline following treatment. For some patients \nwith chronic speech and swallowing challenges, this follow-up \nmay need to be indefinite.\n\u0017Maintain range of motion, which may include the following:\n ◊Practice gentle stretching\n ◊Consider pentoxifylline and vitamin E in patients at high risk for \ntrismus\n ◊Custom mouth-opening devices for rehabilitation of trismus and \nactive and passive range of jaw motion\n ◊Lymphatic decompression therapy to prevent fibrosis and \nimprove range of motion\n• Pain\n\u0017Assess pain from oral mucositis and prescribe pregabalin \n(category 2B),4 gabapentin,5 doxepin,6,7 or diphenhydramine/\nlidocaine/antacid mouthwash6 as clinically indicated. \n\u0017Consider referral to dentistry/oral medicine and/or supportive \nmedicine for assistance in functional assessments, symptom \npalliation, and functional rehabilitation of patients with head and \nneck cancer.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

However, consideration of other risk factors for swallowing dysfunction must be taken into \naccount as well.\n• For those who did not warrant prophylactic PEG or NG tube placement pre-treatment, caloric intake, treatment-related side effects, and \nchange in body weight should be monitored weekly during treatment.8 Consider reactive feeding tube placement if two or more of the \nfollowing criteria apply: \n\u0017Inadequate food intake (60% of estimated energy expenditure) anticipated for >10 days.9 \n\u0017Weight loss of ≥5% in 1 month\n\u0017Severe mucositis/mucosal pain, odynophagia, dysphagia (grade 3+), or aspiration\n\u0017Age >60 years10\n• To maintain swallowing function during and following treatment (eg, radiation), patients who may have feeding tube placement should be \nencouraged to intake orally if they can swallow without, or with minimal, aspiration or any other compromises. Alterations in swallowing \nfunction can occur long after treatment (especially after radiation-based treatment) and should be monitored for the lifetime of the patient.

RT also affects the dental hard tissues, which increases their \nsusceptibility to demineralization3 within the presence of xerostomia, microbial changes following RT, and changes to a more cariogenic diet. \nIMRT and salivary gland-sparing techniques are associated with dose-dependent recovery of salivary function over time4 and with reduced \nrisk for dental caries long term for some patients.5 Radiation-related caries and other dental hard tissue changes can appear within the first 3 \nmonths following RT.6,7\nGoals of Pre-RT Oral/Dental Evaluation :\n1.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-2 Overview \nThe NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) \nfor Head and Neck  Cancers address tumors arising from the oral cavity  \n(including mucosal lip) , pharynx,  larynx, and paranasal  sinuses . Occult \nprimary cancer s, salivary gland cancers,  and mucosal melanoma (MM) \nare also addressed.  In 2025, it is estimated that about 72 ,680 new cases \nof oral cavity, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers will occur, which account \nfor approximately 3.6% of new cancer cases in the United States.1 An \nestimated 16,680 deaths from head and neck (H&N) cancers will occur \nduring the same time period.1 Squamous cell carcinomas account for \n>90% of these tumors. Tobacco and alcohol use disorders are the most \ncommon etiologies for oral cavity, hypopharynx, larynx, and human \npapillomavirus (HPV) -unrelated (p16 negative) oropharynx cancers. \nPatients whose H&N cancers due to tobacco and alcohol are at risk for \nharboring synchronous primary tumors and/or developing second primary \nneoplasms of the H&N, lung, esophagus, bladder, and other potential sites \nthat are exposed to these carcinogens.  \nStage at diagnosis predicts survival rates and guides care of patients with \nH&N cancers. In general, stage I or II disease defines a relatively small \nprimary tumor with out regional nodal involvement amongst HPV -unrelated \ncancers. Stage III or I Va/b HPV-unrelated cancers and stages I, II, and III \nHPV-related (p16 positive) cancers may include larger primary tumors, \nwhich may invade underlying structures and/or spread to regional nodes. Distant metastases  (Stage IVc HPV- unrelated cancers or Stage IV HPV -\nrelated cancers  are less common at presentation as compared to lung and \nesophagus cancers. More advanced TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) \nstages are associated with worse survival . \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update \nMethodology  \nPrior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines® for Head and Neck Cancers, \nan electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key \nliterature in H&N cancers  published since the previous Guidelines update,  \nusing the following search terms: (head and neck cancer) OR (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) OR (lip cancer) OR (oral cavity cancer) \nOR (oropharynx cancer) OR (hypopharynx cancer) OR (nasopharynx \ncancer) OR (larynx cancer) OR (paranasal tumor) OR (ethmoid sinus \ntumor) OR (maxillary sinus  tumor) OR (salivary gland tumor) OR (mucosal \nmelanoma head) OR (mucosal melanoma neck)  OR (recurrent metastatic \nhead neck cancer) . The PubMed database was chosen because it \nremains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature.  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; \nGuideline; Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-\nAnalysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key \nPubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as \nrelevant to these guidelines as discussed by the P anel during the \nGuidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high -level evidence is lacking are \nbased on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor  to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-3 Guidelines  incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guideli nes will \ncontinue to use the terms men , women , female, and male  when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender  from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nHuman Papillomavirus Infection \nHPV infection is a predominant cause of squamous cell carcinomas of the \noropharynx (particularly cancers of the tonsils  and tongue base) .2-9 \nHowever, small subsets of squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, \nlarynx, nasopharynx, and paranasal sinuses are HPV positive,10 and 50% \nof patients with squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary in the H&N \nare HPV positive.11 The overall incidence of HPV -positive oropharynx \ncancers is increasing in the United States, particularly in men,12 while the \nincidence of HPV -negative (primarily tobacco - and alcohol -related) cancer \nis decreasing.13 The attributable fraction for HPV in newly diagnosed \noropharyngeal cancer is estimated as 60% to 70% in the United States \nand parts of the European Union.13-17 Patients with HPV -positive cancer \nhave tended to be younger9,18; however, HPV -positive oropharynx cancer \nrates are rising among older adults as the exposed cohorts age.19,20 Oral \nHPV16 infection increases the risk of  oropharynx cancer,2,8,21,22 and a \nstrong causal relationship has been established.2,21 HPV16 accounts for \n~90% of cases, and HPV18, 33, and 35 are responsible for the vast \nmajority of the small remaining fraction.9 The prevalence of HPV16 is higher in oropharyngeal cancer than in cervical cancer (~50%), in which \nHPV18 is also highly prevalent.14,23 -25 Expression of the HPV E6 and E7 \noncogenes inactivates the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb, \nrespectively, which are frequently mutated in tobacco- related mucosal \nsquamous cell carcinomas. Inactivation of p53 and pRb promotes genomic instability and t he development of cancer and is responsible for the \nupregulation of p16 protein expression, a reliable surrogate marker of the presence of HPV DNA in these tumors. Genetic profiling of HPV -positive \ncancer has demonstrated it to be genetically distinct from  HPV-negative \nsquamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).\n26 \nAnalyses from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2011– 2014), including 2627 adults aged 18 to 33 years, showed that HPV \nvaccination was associated with reduced vaccine- type oral HPV infection \n(0.1% in vaccinated individuals vs. 1.6% in unvaccinated individuals; P = \n.008).\n27 Moreover, HPV vaccination in the United States has led to herd \nprotection against oral HPV16, 18, 6, and 11 infections in unvaccinated \nmales.28 Results of an ongoing randomized clinical trial to investigate the \nefficacy of HPV vaccines for the prevention of oral HPV infections have \nnot yet been reported. While data are not yet available, the HPV types that \ncause the overwhelming majority of SCCHN are included in the HPV nonavalent  vaccine (provides protection against nine high- risk HPV types) . \nSince there is evidence that vaccination prevents HPV -related cervical and \nanal cancers ,\n29-31 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) expanded \nthe indication for HPV vaccination to include prevention of oral HPV \ninfections and related oropharyngeal cancer s in 2020.  \nPatients with locally advanced HPV -positive SCCHN have improved \nresponse to treatment and survival (overall survival [OS] and \nprogression- free survival [PFS] ) when compared with HPV -negative \ntumors.11,32- 37 Treatment response is improved in patients receiving \nradiation therapy (RT) or chemoradiation.32,38,39  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-4 Distinguishing patients with p16 positivity by HPV tumor status informs \nprognosis. A multicenter individual patient data analysis including 13 \ncohorts of patients from Canada and Europe (N = 7654) showed that \npatients with discordant p16 expression and HPV  status (5 -year OS of \n53.2%; 95% CI, 46.6 %–60.8% for p16 -negative/HPV -positive; 5 -year OS \nof 54.7%; 95% CI, 49.2 %–60.9% for p16- positive/HPV -negative) had \nworse prognosis compared to patients with concordant positive p16 expression and HPV status (5 -year OS of 81.1%; 95% CI, 79.5% –82.7% \nfor p16- negative/HPV -positive).\n40 Prognosis was worst for patients with \nconcordant negative p16 expression and HPV status (5- year OS of 40.4 %; \n95% CI, 38.6% –42.4% for p16 -negative/HPV -positive).41,42 A retrospective \ncohort analysis (N = 1070) also showed better OS in patients with HPV \n16/18 positive sinonasal cancer, compared to patients with HPV negative \ndisease (adjusted hazard ratio [ HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48 –0.82).43 \nThe impact of smoking and cancer stage on survival of patients with HPV -\npositive SCCHN has been investigated in numerous studies .44-46 For \nexample, analyses of patients with oropharyngeal cancer who were \nenrolled in RTOG 9003 or 0129 ( n = 165) showed that smoking was \nassociated with decreased OS and PFS, regardless of p16 status.44 An \nanalysis of data compiled from four cooperative group trials estimated that \nthose who never smoked had a 51% (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.33– 0.75) \nreduction in risk of cancer progression when compared to those who \nformerly or currently smoked and had HPV -posit ive SCCHN.46 A \nretrospective analysis from a clinical trial (RTOG 0129) showed no \ndifference in the rate of distant metastasis in patients with p16- positive \nversus p16- negative disease.32 Additional analyses have suggested that \nindividuals with T4 or N3 disease or radiographically detectable matted \nlymph nodes may have a worse prognosis, and therefore should be \nexcluded from deintensification trials.47-50 These studies on prognostic and \npredictive factors in HPV-positive oropharyngeal  cancers  form the basis \nfor RT deintensification studies. Moreover, the striking difference in prognosis for HPV -positive versus HPV -negative SCCHN led to the \ncreation of new AJCC staging criteria in 2018 (see Cancer of the \nOropharynx  in the NCCN Guidelines for  Head and Neck Cancers; \navailable at www.NCCN.org ). \nManagement Approaches \nThe specific site of disease, histology, stage, and baseline comorbid \nconditions guide treatment decisions (eg, the appropriate surgical \nprocedures, radiotherapy treatment parameters [target volumes, total \ndose, and fractionation regimen], indications for systemic therapy, patient -\nspecific considerations). Single- modality treatment with surgery or RT is \ngenerally recommended for the approximately 30% to 40% of patients who \npresent with early -stage disease (stage I or II) HPV -unrelated cancers. \nSurgery and R T result in similar survival for many H&N cancers, but \nsurgery is usually preferred for oral cavity and paranasal sinus cancers, \nwhile RT with or without chemotherapy is nearly always preferred for all \nstages of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and more advanced stages of \nHPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. The choice of surgery or RT as \nthe primary treatment modality is often based on local institutional expertise and/or perceived relative morbidity of these treatment options. \nWith the evolution of conformal techniques of RT and less invasive \nsurgery, as well as improving supportive care for patients receiving \nsystemic therapy, morbidity is also a moving target. Combined modality \ntherapy (eg, surgery and radiation or chemoradiation) is generally \nrecommended for the approximately 60% of patients with locally or \nregionally advanced disease at diagnosis.  \nParticipation in clinical trials is a preferred or recommended treatment \noption in many situations. In formulating these NCCN Guidelines, Panel \nmembers have tried to create them with evidence- based practices while \nproviding a statement of consensus as to the acceptable range of \ntreatment options.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-5 at high- volume centers appear to have better outcomes relative to patients \ntreated at low -volume centers.51-56 \nMultidisciplinary Team Involvement  \nThe initial evaluation and treatment planning for patients with H&N \ncancers requires a multidisciplinary team of health care providers with \nexpertise in caring for such patients.57,58 Similarly, managing and \npreventing sequelae following surgery, RT, and systemic therapy (eg, trismus, pain, lymphedema and muscle spasm of the neck, xerostomia, \ndysphagia, speech and swallowing problems, dental and jaw decay, \ndepression, peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss, renal failure) requires \nprofessionals familiar with these diseases.\n59,60 Follow -up for such \nsequelae should include a comprehensive H&N examination, supportive \ncare, and rehabilitation ( see Follow -Up Recommendations  in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).57 Adequate nutritional support \ncan help to prevent severe weight loss in patients receiving treatment for \nH&N cancers and shorten post -treatment recovery times; therefore, \npatients should be referred to a registered dietitian at diagnosis, during, and after  treatment, as needed ( see Principles of Nutrition: Management \nand Supportive Care  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers ).\n61 Dental care to prevent and treat radiation- related effects must \nbe provided ( see Principles of Oral/ Dental Evaluation and Management  in \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers ). Evaluation by a \nspeech- language/swallowing therapist before and after treatment is also \nstrongly recommended. Evaluation and management of lymphedema and \ntrismus should be conducted as clinically indicated with appropriate \nreferrals to occupational and physical therapy. Patients are at risk for \ndepression from H&N cancer and its sequelae, thus screening and \ntreatment for depression is advised (see the NCCN Guidelines for Distress \nManagement, available at www.NCCN.org ).62-65 Fertility/reproductive \ncounseling should be offered to patients who have these concerns [see \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology, available at www.NCCN.org ]. Specific components of patient support and \nfollow- up are listed in the algorithm (see Team Approach in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Head and Neck Cancers ). Panel members also recommend \nreferring to the NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care  and NCCN Guidelines \nfor Adult Cancer Pain as needed (available at www.NCCN.org ). Patients \nshould be kept well -informed of the risks, benefits, and potential outcomes \nof treatment options and should be fully involved in their shared decision-\nmaking process.  \nCigarette smoking is associated with at least 30% of cancer deaths,66 and, \ntherefore, patients’ history of tobacco use must be assessed. Patients \nshould be encouraged to stop smoking (and remain abstinent in particular \nduring treatment with RT) and to modify excessive alcohol consumption. These habits  cannot only decrease the efficacy of treatment, but adversely \naffect other health outcomes.\n67-69 Information on smoking cessation \nresources and support can be found in the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking \nCessation (available at www.NCCN.org ). Alcohol use is also associated \ncausally with H&N cancer.70,71 Therefore, alcohol use should be \ndocumented during history and physical ( H&P) and counseling \nadministered as indicated.  \nUniversal screening for hepatitis B for patients undergoing cancer therapy \nis recommended.72 All patients with cancer anticipating systemic therapy  \ntreatment  should be screened for hepatitis B through three tests. People \nliving with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) receiving any systemic therapy  for \ncancer treatment  should receive antiviral prophylaxis for the duration of \ntreatment , as well as for at least 12 months after receipt of the last \nsystemic therapy treatment . While screening is important for all patients, it \nis particular ly important for patients who are disproportionately affected by \nhepatitis  B, including persons of Asian, Pacific Islander , and African \ndescent.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-6 Resectable Versus Unresectable Disease  \nThe NCCN Member Institutions have teams experienced in the \ncomprehensive treatment of H&N cancers and maintain the \nmultidisciplinary infrastructure needed for reconstruction and rehabilitation. \nA patient’s cancer is deemed unresectable if H&N surgeons at N CCN \nMember Institutions do not think they can remove the gross tumor on \nanatomic grounds or if local control is unlikely to be achieved with surgery \n(even with the addition of RT to the treatment approach). Typically, these \nunresectable tumors densely involve the prevertebral fascia, cervical \nvertebrae, skull base, brachial plexus, deep muscles of the neck, \nmediastinal structures, or critical H&N vasculature (see Principles of \nSurgery  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). \nUnresectable tumors are associated with overall poor prognosis.  \nUnresectable tumors shou ld be distinguished from inoperable tumors in \nthose patients whose constitutional state of health precludes an operation \n(even if the cancer could be readily resected with few sequelae). \nAdditionally, a subgroup of patients will decline surgical management , but \ntheir tumors should not be deemed unresectable. In some patients, adequate reconstructive options may be lacking; therefore, the patient’s \ndisease is considered functionally unresectable. Examples include \nbilateral orbital exenteration or exenteration in the only seeing eye, extensive mandibular resection without reconstruction options, or total \npharyngectomy when reconstitution of the alimentary tract is not feasible. \nAlthough these are rare occurrences, the impact on quality of life (QOL) \nand the need for continual supportive care are significant and open- ended. \nAlthough local and regional disease may be surgically treatable, patients with distant metastases may not benefit from surgery, and therefore their \ndisease is deemed i noperable. In incurable situations, surgery may still be \nconsidered for symptom palliation in select cases. Thus, patient choice or \na physician’s expectations regarding cure and morbidity will influence or \ndetermine treatment. Patients with locally advanced but resectable tumors, who can also be adequately treated without surgery, represent a very important group that is distinct from patients with unresectable disease. \nDefinitive treatment with RT alone or RT combined with systemic therapy \nmay represent equivalent or preferable approaches to surgery in these \nindividuals. Although such patients may not undergo surgery, their tumors \nshould not be labeled as unresectable. Their disease is usually far less \nextensive than those with disease that truly cannot be removed.  \nComorbidity and Quality of Life \nComorbidity  \nComorbidity refers to the presence of concomitant disease(s) (in addition \nto H&N cancers) that may affect diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. \nDocumentation of comorbidity is important to facilitate optimal treatment \nselection. Comorbidity is known to be a  strong independent predictor for \nmortality in patients with H&N cancers,73,74 and it also influences QOL and \nhealth care costs and utilization .75-77 The Adult Comorbidity Evaluation- 27 \n(ACE -27) is a validated instrument for assessing comorbidity in numerous \ncancer types including H&N cancers.78 An important consideration when \ninterpreting published clinical trial data is the applicability of the results to \npatients with significant comorbidities, who may have been \nineligible/excluded from such studi es. \nQuality of Life \nHealth -related QOL issues are important in patients with H&N cancers. \nThese tumors affect the patient’s basic physiologic functions (ie, the ability \nto chew, swallow, breathe), the senses (ie, taste, smell, hearing), and \nuniquely human characteristics ( ie, appearance, voice). Health status  \ndescribes an individual’s physical, emotional, and social capabilities and limitations. Function and performance refer to how well an individual is \nable to perform important roles, tasks, or activities. QOL  differs becaus e \nthe central focus is on the value (determined by the patient alone) that \nindividuals place on their health status and function.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-7 Patient -completed scales should be used to measure QOL.79 Three \nvalidated and accepted measures for H&N cancer -specific issues are: 1) \nthe University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW -QOL)80; 2) \nthe European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality \nof Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Module (EORTC -QLQ -H&N35)81; \nand 3) the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head and Neck (FACT -H&N) scale.\n82 The Performance Status Scale is a clinician -rated \nperformance scale that is widely used for patients with H&N cancers .83 \nThe Oral Mucositis Weekly Questionnaire HN (OMWQ -HN) is a validated \npatient -reported instrument that measures the symptoms of oral mucositis , \nincluding mouth and throat pain,  and its impact on well -being and \nfunction.84 Use of the Patient -Reported Outcomes version of the Common \nTerminology Criteria for Adverse events, which was developed to facilitate \nevaluation of symptomatic toxicity in patients enrolled in cancer clinical \ntrials, is encouraged ( https://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/pro -ctcae/ ). \nImaging of Head and Neck Cancers  \nAppropriate selection and utilization  of imaging studies is crucial for proper \ncare of patients with H&N cancers. Initial imaging of the primary site is performed with CT and/or MRI. MRI is generally preferred over CT in \npatients with symptoms that involve the cranial nerves or tumors that \nencroach on the skull base. CT, however, is complementary to MRI for \nevaluation of bony erosion or cartilage invasion that may occur with some \nH&N tumors (eg, laryngeal cancer). In patients with H&N cancers that \ninvolve t he bone, MRI is needed to evaluate the extent of bone marrow \ninvasion, while CT is preferred to evaluate cortical bone erosion or periosteal invasion. For cancers originating in the base of the tongue, MRI \ncan often delineate the boundary between gross tum or and normal muscle \nmore effectively than CT. MRI is also preferable to CT for differentiating tumor extent from obstructed sinuses or secretions and to evaluate \nintracranial/dural involvement. Evaluation of lymph node metastases can \nbe done with either C T or MRI, depending on the primary site, although both have lower accuracy as compared with FDG -PET/CT.\n85 Ultimately, \nchoosing CT or MRI should be driven by the information desired as both \nare not routinely indicated.  \nThere is evidence to support the superiority of FDG -PET/CT for detecting \nlocoregional nodal and distant metastases in patients with H&N cancers. A \nmeta -analysis including 18 studies showed that the positive predictive \nvalue (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of FDG -PET/CT for \ndetection of cervical lymph node involvement in patients with clinically \nnode- negative SCCHN was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.55– 0.69) and 0.83 (95% CI, \n0.79– 0.86), respectively.85 Analyses from the prospective ACRIN 6685 \nstudy (SCCHN; 64% oral cavity) showed that, in patients with cN0 \ndisease, 125/144 (87%) negative PET scans were pathologically negative \nat neck dissection.86 Findings from PET/CT changed the surgical plan in \n22% of patients. A prospective single- center study from Germany (N = \n150) showed an NPV of 93.3% (95% CI, 88.2% –98.5%) for detection of \ncervical lymph node metastases by FDG -PET/CT.87 If there is concern \nabout metastasis to a specific anatomic area, then directed CT or MRI \nmay also be performed (eg, contrast -enhanced chest CT to evaluate \npulmonary metastases and/or mediastinal lymph node involvement; \ncontrast -enhanced brain MRI for evaluation of brain metastases or skull \nbase invasion). H &N cancers  rarely metastasize to the brain by a \nhematogenous route . Therefore,  ordering a full brain study  as part of the \ninitial imaging workup is not routine.  \nFor patients who are dentulous and expected to receive postoperative RT, \na panoramic dental x -ray should be completed before treatment as part of \nthe dental evaluation (see Principles of Oral/ Dental Evaluation and \nManagement in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). \nPanorex is also helpful for evaluation of dentition and mandibular height if a marginal resection is being considered.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-8 Short -Term Evaluation of Locoregionally Advanced Disease  \nImaging is often part of response assessment  following definitive therapy.  \nCareful consideration should be given as to the type of imaging performed. \nIt is unlikely all three modalities  (CT, MRI, and FDG -PET/CT)  will be \nneeded, and this may add cost and inconvenience without significant added value.   \nPatients treated with induction chemotherapy may receive imaging with \nCT or MRI after two or three cycles of chemotherapy. If there is high \nconcern for distant metastasis, a chest CT or FDG -PET/CT may be \nneeded to evaluate whether to proceed to the planned definitive local \ntherapy.  \nFor patients with locoregionally advanced disease who have undergone surgery, postoperative imaging is recommended if there are signs of early \nrecurrence or for patients considered high risk of  early recurrence. This \nmay be needed to evaluate whether to proceed with the planned adjuvant radiation- based therapy and/or to determine targets and dosing of \nradiation in case of unexpected recurrence. Patients with positive margins, advanced T or N stage, or oral cavity cancers are at particular risk for \nrapid rec urrence after surgery.\n88 \nAfter definitive -intent treatment completion, the Panel generally \nrecommends imaging 3 to 4 months after the end of treatment, or as early \nas 4 to 8 weeks after definitive treatment if there is concern about an \nincomplete treatment response. Of note, proximity to recent treatment can complicate interpretation of radiographic studies, and communication  with \nthe interpreting radiologist/nuclear medicine physicians  is important to \ndistinguish recurrent disease from post -treatment effect. Positive PET \nresults  can be particularly difficult to interpret earlier than 12 weeks \nfollowing treatment, as shown in multiple prospective and retrospective \nstudies.\n89-91 Careful and regular follow -up examinations are recommended so that any \nlocal or regional recurrence is detected early. After RT- based treatment, \nevaluation with imaging (ie, CT and/or MRI with contrast or FDG -PET/CT) \nguides the use of neck dissection ( see Follow -Up Recommendations: Post \nSystemic Therapy/RT or RT Neck Evaluation in the NCCN Gu idelines for \nHead and Neck Cancers).92-96 A meta -analysis of 27 studies showed that \nthe PPV and NPV for PET or PET/CT to detect local residual or recurrent \ndisease were 52.7% and 96.3%, respectively, and 72.3% and 88.3%, \nrespectively, for detection of nodal residual or recurrent disease.91 If \nPET/CT is used for follow -up, the first scan should be performed at a \nminimum of  12 weeks after treatment to reduce the false- positive rate.89-91 \nPET/CT surveillance in patients with advanced nodal disease who received systemic therapy/RT yielded a comparable survival rate and QOL \nand may be more cost -effective, relative to planned neck dissection.\n97,98 A \n2023 Cochrane review compared the risks and benefits of surgical, or other treatment modalities, for tumors of the oral cavity or oropharynx \namong 15 studies.\n99 One trial found n o difference (moderate certainty) in \nOS or locoregional recurrence when comparing individuals (n = 564) who \nreceived a PET/CT post -chemoradiation (with neck dissection only if no or \nincomplete response) to those who underwent planned neck dissection (prior  to or after chemoradiation).  Care should be taken regarding the  \ntiming and interpretation of PET studies, as false- positive results may \noccur due to  recent infection or treatment -related inflammation.  \nNote that a complete clinical response (ie, clinically negative) may be \ndefined as no visible or palpable evidence of residual disease and no \nconcerning findings on CT or MRI\n92,100; a complete pathologic response \nrequires pathologic confirmation. If a complete clinical response to RT -\nbased treatment has been achieved, then the Panel recommends \nobserving the patient.92,100,101 In patients who have a clinically negative \nneck, PET/CT is associated with NPVs ranging from 97% to 100%.102- 104 \nPanel members also concur that any patient with residual disease after PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-9 RT-based treatment should be considered for surgical resection for \nrefractory disease, including a neck dissection if indicated.92 If the residual, \npersistent, or progressing disease is unresectable, then these patients \nshould receive systemic therapy and/or RT as described for recurrent or \npersistent disease in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers. \nFor patients with equivoc al PET/CT scan results in the neck, a prospective \nstudy suggests that a repeat PET/CT scan 4 to 6 weeks later may help \nidentify those patients who can be safely observed without surgery to the \nneck.105 These patients may also continue to be observed if the clinical \nexamination is reassuring.  \nLong- Term Evaluation of Recurrent Disease  \nRecurrences in patients with H&N cancer tend to occur in the first 3 years \nfollowing treatment, with more occurring earlier rather than later in this \ninterval. There is little evidence to support imaging surveillance in the long -\nterm (ie, >6 months followi ng treatment) in patients who have negative \nimaging results,90,106 although delayed or late recurrences are more \ncommon in patients with HPV -related H&N cancer.107 Imaging should be \nprompted by new symptoms or physical examination findings. A meta -\nanalysis including seven studies with 577 scans showed that FDG -\nPET/CT showed high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (91%) values for \ndetection of H&N cancer recurrence 12  months after treatment.108 \nHowever, a retrospective study including 1114 patients with H&N cancer \nshowed that PET/CT scans conducted at 12 and 24 months after \ntreatment completion become less equivocal with time.106 Further, among \npatients with negative 3- month scans, there were no significant differences \nin subsequent survival outcomes in patients whose recurrences were \ndetected through PET/CT versus those with clinically detected \nrecurrences.  \nH&N cancer treatment can result in fibrosis and altered anatomy, which \nfrequently leads to challenges in physical examination that may be assisted by follow -up imaging. Ultimately, the plan for long- term \nsurveillance should consider tumor site, stage, prognostic factors, \npresence of symptoms, and changes based on clinical examination. Neck \nultrasound (US), which is widely available, inexpens ive, safe, and \naccurate, may be used to evaluate suspected nodal disease. For areas difficult to visualize by clinical examination (ie, due to anatomy or areas \nobscured by treatment change), routine annual imaging using the pretreatment imaging modality (usually CT or MRI) may be indicated. The \nimpact of annual screening for lung metastasis or synchronous lung \ncancer in patients with a heavy smoking history is an area in need of \ninvestigation. Annual low -resolution chest CT should be considered for \nthese patients. Many clinicians obtain a chest x -ray for lung screening, but \nthis is not supported by strong evidence due to l imited sensitivity\n109,110 (see \nNCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). H&N RT treatment is associated with development of \ncarotid artery stenosis,111,112 and RT dose to the carotid artery is \nassociated with increased stroke risk.113 The Society for Vascular Surgery \nrecommends initial carotid imaging surveillance within 2 years following the completion of radiation therapy, followed by screening every 3 \nyears .\n114 This recommendation acknowledges the high risk of \natherosclerotic disease in patients who have undergone neck irradiation, \nthus justifying screening in asymptomatic patients.115 \nTreatment Principles \nHead and Neck Surgery \nAll patients should be evaluated by an H&N surgical oncologist before any \ntreatment is administered. In addition, it is critical that multidisciplinary \nevaluation and treatment be well coordinated. Minimally invasive surgery \nmay be useful for decreasing morbidity.116,117 For H&N cancer surgery , \ntransoral resection using robotic , endoscopic, or direct access  surgery \nmay offer advantages over  conventional methods.118- 120 Use of robotic \nsurgery is increasing in the United States.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-10 reported in 13% to 16% of patients who are treated with transoral robotic \nsurgery (TORS).121,122 The risk of this complication can be reduced \nthrough use of appropriate surgical strategies (eg, transcervical arterial \nligation). TORS is associated with favorable QOL and swallowing \noutcomes, although outcome may vary depending on baseline function, T \nstage, and adjuvant treatment.123,124 Evaluation, integration of therapy, \nassessment of resectability, principles for primary tumor resection, margins, surgical management of the neck and cranial nerves (VII, X –XII), \nmanagement of recurrences, and principles for surveillance (including post-treatment neck evaluation) are discussed in the algorithm (see \nPrinciples of Surgery  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers) .\n125,126 \nNeck Dissection  \nHistorically, cervical lymph node (ie, neck) dissections have been \nclassified as radical  or modified radical  procedures. The less radical \nprocedures preserved the sternocleidomastoid muscle, jugular vein, spinal accessory nerve, or selective lymph node levels. The NCCN Panel prefers \nto classify cervical lymphadenectomy using contemporary nomenclature; \nthus, cerv ical lymph node dissections are classified as either \ncomprehensive or selective.\n127 A comprehensive neck dissection removes \nall lymph node groups that would be included in a classic radical neck \ndissection. Whether the sternocleidomastoid muscle, jugular vein, or \nspinal accessory nerve is preserved does not affect whether the dissection \nis classified as comprehensive.  \nSelective neck dissections have been developed based on the common \npathways for spread of H&N cancers to regional nodes (see Figure \n2).128,129 Depending on the site, selective neck dissection is often \nrecommended for N0 disease (see the algorithm for specific sites and \nNeck Management  in Principles of Surgery  in the NCCN Guidelines for \nHead and Neck Cancers). To remove the nodes most commonly involved with metastases from the oral cavity,  a selective neck dissection is \nrecommended , which  includes the nodes found above the omohyoid \nmuscle (levels I –III and sometimes the superior parts of level I V).127,130 \nSimilarly, to remove the nodes most commonly involved with metastases \nfrom the pharynx and larynx , a selective neck dissection is recommended , \nwhich includes the nodes in levels II  to IV and level V when appropriate .127 \nSCCHN with no clinical nodal involvement rarely presents with nodal metastasis beyond the confines of an appropriate selective neck \ndissection (<10% of the time).\n131- 133  \nThe chief role of selective neck dissections in these NCCN Guidelines is to \ndetermine which patients are candidates for possible adjuvant therapy (ie, \nsystemic therapy/RT or RT), although selective neck dissections may be \nused as treatment when neck tumor burden is low.134 In general, patients \nundergoing selective neck dissection should not have clinical nodal \ndisease; however, selective neck dissection may prevent morbidity as \nopposed to comprehensive neck dissection in patients with low -volume \nnodal disease, specifically in certain patients with N1–N2 disease.135- 137 In \npatients with pathologically positive lymph nodes, radiation with or without \nchemotherapy should be considered and a decision should be made \nfollowing multidisciplinary evaluation. In the NCCN Guidelines, patients \nwith cervical node metastasis who unde rgo operations with therapeutic \nintent are generally treated with cervical lymphadenectomy to remove all clinically positive nodes, other levels of the neck that may be at high risk \nfor harboring metastasis, and non -lymphatic structures that are directly \ninvolved with cancer. Determining whether an ipsilateral or bilateral neck \ndissection is needed depends on location and the extent of the tumor, \nparticularly for tumors that approach or involve the midline where bilateral \nlymphatic drainage is likely .\n125 When anatomic imaging and/or fine-needle \naspiration (FNA) identify pathologic adenopathy bilaterally, both sides of \nthe neck should be dissected.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-11 Guidance on neck management following definitive RT or systemic \ntherapy/RT treatment can be found in Follow -Up Recommendations: Post \nSystemic Therapy/RT or RT Neck Evaluation in the NCCN Guidelines for \nHead and Neck Cancers.  \nPostoperative Management of High -Risk Disease \nMany factors influence survival and locoregional tumor control in patients \nwith H&N cancers. The role of systemic therapy/RT in the postoperative \ncare of the patient with adverse prognostic risk factors has been clarified \nby two separate multicenter randomized trials  for patients with high- risk \ncancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx.138,139 A \ncombined analysis of data from the two trials  has been done.140  \nThe US Intergroup trial  (RTOG 9501) r andomly assigned patients with two \nor more involved nodes, positive margins, or extracapsular nodal spread \nof tumor to receive standard postoperative RT or the same RT  plus \ncisplatin (100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for three doses ).139 Note that \nlong- term results from RTOG 9501 have been published.141 The European \ntrial (EORTC 22931) was designed using the same chemotherapy treatment and similar RT dosing but also included as high- risk factors the \npresence of perineural or vascular embolism  and nodal involvement at \nlevels IV and V  from an oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancer .\n138 The RTOG \ntrial showed statistically significant improvement in locoregional control \nand disease- free survival ( DFS) but not OS, whereas the EORTC trial \nfound significant improvement in survival and the other outcome \nparameters.  \nTo better define risk, a combined analysis of prognostic factors and outcome from the RTOG 9501 and EORTC 22931 trials was performed. \nThis analysis showed that patients in both trials with extranodal extension of tumor and/or positive resection margins benefited from the addition of \ncisplatin to postoperative RT.  For those with multiple involved regional \nnodes without extranodal  extension, there was no survival advantage.\n140,141 However, it is important to  note that the combined \nanalysis was considered exploratory by the authors.140 These publications \nform the basis for the NCCN recommendations  regarding adjuvant \ntreatment . \nIn NCCN Member Institutions, most patients with extranodal extension \nwith or without positive surgical margins receive adjuvant \nchemoradiotherapy after surgery. The presence of other adverse \npathologic risk factors —multiple positive nodes (without extranodal \nextension), perineural invasion, vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion, pT3 \nor pT4 primary, and oral cavity or oropharyngeal primary cancers with \npositive level IV or V nodes —are generally established indications for \npostoperative RT. Because patients w ith these other adverse pathologic \nfeatures were also included in the EORTC 22931 trial that showed a \nsurvival advantage for patients receiving cisplatin concurrently with \npostoperative RT compared to RT alone, the NCCN Panel added a \nrecommendation to consider chemoradiation for these features.138 \nPerformance status (PS) and physiologic reserve should be taken into \nconsideration before recommending postoperative concurrent \nchemoradiotherapy in patients with high- risk pathology.  \nIn a randomized phase III trial from a single institution in India, cisplatin 30 \nmg/m2 weekly was compared to cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, when \ngiven concurrently with RT, in 300 patients with locally advanced SCCHN (93% in the adjuvant setting).\n142 Two-year locoregional control was \nsuperior in patients randomized to receive cisplatin once every 3 weeks (73.1%), compared to patients randomized to receive weekly cisplatin \n(58.5%) (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11– 2.79; P = .014). However, patients \nrandomized to receive cisplatin once every 3 weeks developed more severe acute toxicities, compared to patients randomized to receive \nweekly cisplatin (84.6% vs. 71.6%, respectively; P = .006).

A \nschedule using cisplatin at 50 mg intravenously (IV) weekly  has also been \nshown to improve survival in the adjuvant setting in a randomized trial.143  \nIn a randomized phase II/III study from India in which patients with locally \nadvanced SCCHN and who were cisplatin- ineligible received RT alone or \nconcurrently with docetaxel (N = 356), 2- year DFS (42.0% vs . 30.3%, \nrespectively; HR, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.52– 0.87; P = .002), median OS (25.5 vs . \n15.3 months, respectively; P = .035), and 2 -year OS (50.8% vs . 41.7%, \nrespectively; HR, 0.75, 95% CI, 0.57– 0.98; P = .035) were all significantly \ngreater in the docetaxel arm compared to the RT alone arm (39% treated postoperatively).\n144 There was a significantly greater incidence of some \ngrade 3 or above adverse events (mucositis, odynophagia, and \ndysphagia) in the docetaxel arm. Study results support use of docetaxel as \na radiosensitizer for patients undergoing adjuvant treatment who ar e \ncisplatin ineligible.  \nIn the randomized phase II RTOG -0234 trial, two regimens in patients with \nstage III and IV SCCHN were compared: 1) adjuvant chemoradiotherapy \nwith cetuximab and docetaxel; and 2) adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with \ncetuximab and weekly cisplatin ( N = 238).145 After a median follow -up of \n4.4 years, patients randomized to receive docetaxel experienced a 31% reduction in DFS failure rate (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50– 0.96; P = .01), and a \n44% reduction in mortality (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.39– 0.82; P = .001). The \nrandomized phase II/III RTOG 1216 trial is continuing to investigate \ndocetaxel/cetuximab with postoperative RT, compared to cisplatin or \ndocetaxel with postoperative RT (NCT01810913). For patients with high-\nrisk adverse pathologic features following surgery (ie, ex tranodal \nextension and/or positive margins) who are ineligible for platinum therapy, docetaxel/cetuximab is a category 2B option for postoperative systemic \ntherapy/RT.  Surgery  for Relapsed/Refractory Disease  \nPatients with advanced carcinoma (any T, N2– 3) who undergo nonsurgical \ntreatment, such as concurrent chemotherapy and RT, need very close \nfollow- up both to evaluate for local recurrence and to assess for ipsilateral \nor contralateral neck recurrence (see Follow -up Recommendations  in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). For patients who do not \nhave a complete clinical response to systemic therapy/RT, surgery is \nrecommended as indicated. However, all P anel members emphasized that \nit may be difficult to detect local or regional recurrence due to radiation- related tissue changes, and this may result in a delayed \ndiagnosis of persistent or recu rrent disease.  \nPanel members also emphasized the increased risk of complications when surgery  in patients with relapsed/refractory disease is attempted. Some of \nthese patients may require microvascular free tissue transfer to \nreconstruct the surgical defect at the primary site. The patients undergoing \nneck dissection may develop complications related to delayed wound \nhealing, skin necrosis, neuropathy, fibrosis, pain, swallowing difficulties, \nand carotid exposure. Laryngectomy may be indicated to obtain clear \nsurgical mar gins or to prevent aspiration (eg, in patients with advanced \noropharyngeal cancer). After laryngectomy for relapsed/refractory disease, patients may have a higher incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistula, \npharyngeal and stomal stenosis, and other wound compl ications.\n146 Flaps \nmay be advantageous (either a free flap reconstruction of the \nlaryngopharyngeal defect, or a myocutaneous flap to buttress the suture \nline if the pharynx can be closed primarily).  \nPalliative Surgery  \nCancer itself and cancer directed treatments can both lead to tissue \ndamage and unwanted side effects. Palliative surgical interventions may \nbe warranted.

To promote symptom palliation and quality of \nlife throughout the continuum of care, patients with head and neck cancer \nshould be routinely assessed for eligibility for palliative surgical interventions .\n147 \nHead and Neck Radiation Therapy  \nRT for H&N cancers is increasingly complex. The availability and technical \nprecision of techniques such as intensity -modulated RT (IMRT) or \nintensity -modulated proton therapy (IMPT) have each markedly increased. \nHowever, a thorough understanding of the nat ural history, anatomy, \nclinical circumstances, and imaging of specific disease conditions continues to guide the use of radiation as primary or adjuvant treatment.  \nPrinciples regarding radiation prescriptions and techniques as described in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers are not all -inclusive. \nThe planning and delivery of RT are rapidly evolving, and these technological advances provide much opportunity  for variations and \nindividualization in targeting and dose delivery, obviating traditional \nnotions of standard  fields and targets. Guidelines from the American \nCollege of Radiology describe basic technical specifications. Furthermore, major consensus cont ouring guidelines for treatment of H&N cancers are \navailable for reference, especially for patients who are treated without surgery .\n148,149  \nWhen radiation is given with definitive intent, the dosages prescribed for gross disease are fairly standard, usually in the range of 70 Gy ( at \napproximately 2 Gy/fraction/day ) for the following sites: lip, oral cavity, \nnasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, glottic larynx, supraglottic larynx, \noccult primary, salivary gland tumors, and MM. A second dose (often \napproximately 60 Gy, but varies) may be used to cover volumes considered at the highest risk for microscopic spread, while a lower dose \n(often approx imately 50 Gy, but varies) is used for volumes treated \nelectively with low risk for microscopic spread.  \nAlthough several palliative RT regimens are provided, no single regimen is \npreferred\n150,151; specific regimens vary widely among NCCN Member \nInstitutions. Any palliative RT regimen that might cause severe toxicities \nshould be avoided. More hypofractionated regimens may be useful for \npatients with limited life expectancy, such as a few months. For example, \na common version of the QUAD SHOT regimen consists of a dose of 44.4 \nGy, delivered in 12 fractions  over three cycles, with each cycle separated \nby 2 to 3 weeks .152 \nRadiation Doses  \nSelection of an exact radiation dose prescription and schedule of delivery \ndepends on the primary tumor and neck node size, whether altered \nfractionation is used, and clinical circumstances, including whether \nconcurrent systemic therapy will be used (see Principles of Radiation \nTechniques  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers and see \nthe individual  Principles of Radiation Therapy  for each primary site). The \ndose may need to be decreased if it is prescribed very close to adjacent \norgan at risk (eg, brain, cochlea, optic chiasm and nerves, spinal cord).  In \nthese cases, precise target definition and delineation is crucial, and on-treatment imaging should be used to ensure accurate radiation delivery. \nAnatomical changes (eg, rapidly shrinking tumors, changes in air cavities, \nsignificant weight loss) may nec essitate repeat imaging and treatment \nreplanning.  \nWhen treating definitively using conventional fractionation, the primary \ntumor and involved lymph nodes  (ie, high -risk sites) generally require a \ntotal of 66 Gy (2.0 –2.2 Gy/fraction) to 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction ).\n153- 156 For \nareas considered highly sensitive to radiation, such as neural structures, \nsome clinicians feel that the fractionation should be slightly modified (eg, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

For instance, a \nhyperfractionat ed schedule allows  gross disease to be prescribed a dose \nup to 81.6 Gy (at 1.2 Gy/fraction); hyperfractionation has been used for \nsituations when tumor is abutting brain or optic structures .153,154 Care must \nbe taken if prescribed doses exceed  72 Gy using conventional \nfractionation (2.0 Gy/fraction) , as this may lead to unacceptable rates of \nnormal tissue injury ; however, these data were collected in the era prior to \nadvanced techniques such as IMRT or IMPT.153,157 In contrast,  when using \nconventional fractionation,  elective irradiation to low - and intermediate- risk \nsites is usually prescribed at  44 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 63 Gy (1.6– 1.8 \nGy/fraction), depending on the estimated risk  of tumor involvement , and \non whether 3D conformal RT (3D -CRT) or IMRT is used. For 3D -CRT and \nsequential plans using IMRT, a range of 44–50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction)  is \noften suggested.158,159 For simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) IMRT, a \nrange of doses from 54– 63 Gy (1.6 –1.8 Gy/fraction)  can be used \ndepending on the fractionation schedule and the risk of tumor involvement \nin the area where the dose is prescribed .159- 161 In definitive RT, the delivery \nof six fractions per week is widely accepted, in a mildly accelerated \nschedule, especially if chemotherapy is not prescribed concurrently .155 \nHypofractionation, when RT is given at >3.0 Gy/fraction, has been reported in some single institutional experiences and clinical \ntrials ,\n151,152,162,163 but a lack of high- level randomized comparator data and \nconcerns about the possibility of long- term late toxicity have limited its \nwidespread adoption to date.  \nPostoperative irradiation is recommended based on stage, histology, and \nsurgical -pathologic findings. In general, postoperative RT is recommended \nfor selected risk factors, including advanced T  stage, close surgical \nmargins, depth or extent  of invasion, multiple positive nodes, or \nperineural/lympho vascular invasion. High doses of postoperative RT alone (eg, 66 Gy) and/or systemic therapy/RT are recommended for the \nhigh- risk features of extranodal extension and/or positive margins .140,141,156 \nParticularly for these high- risk cases, t he preferred  maximum elapsed time  \ninterval  between surgical resection and the start of postoperative RT  is ≤6 \nweeks.   \nPostoperative radiation fractionation schedules tend to be similar (60– 66 \nGy at 2 Gy/fraction) whether or not systemic therapy is administered \nconcurrently with postoperative RT. Hypofractionation may be considered \nfor patients who are not good candidates for an extended course of \nseveral weeks of RT due to resource limitations or comorbidities, but these \nschedules have not been widely adopted as late effects are a particular concern in the postoperative population.  \nFractionation in RT Alone  \nNo single fractionation schedule has proven to be best for all tumors. Data \nstrongly indicate that SCCHN can grow rapidly and may compensate for \nRT-induced cell loss through the mechanism of accelerated \nrepopulation.164,165 Especially in the RT-alone setting,  schedules delivering \nat least 1000 cGy per week  to gross disease  are recommended,166- 168 \nalthough it is acknowledged that some tumors such as those of the  \nsalivary gland may have slower cell kinetics. Trials in early -stage laryngeal \nglottic cancer have shown higher recurrence rates with daily fraction sizes \n<200 cGy where the cumulative weekly dose is < 1000 cGy .169,170 \nTwo large, randomized trials from Europe have reported improved \nlocoregional control using altered fractionation as compared to \nconventional fractionation, when concurrent chemotherapy is not given. \nThe EORTC protocol 22791 compared hyperfractionation (1.15 Gy twice \ndaily, or 80.5 Gy over 7 weeks) with conventional fractionation (2 Gy once \ndaily, or 70 Gy over 7 weeks) in the treatment of T2,  T3, N0–1 \noropharyngeal carcinoma excluding base of tongue primaries.

Acute \ntoxicity was increased with both of these regimens. However, no significant difference was shown in the frequency of grade 3 or worse late \neffects at 6 to 24 months after treatment start, among the various \ntreatment groups.

This benefit, however, was limited to patients < 60 years  of age .175 Hyperfractionation  was \nassociated with a benefit of 8% after 5 years .176 An update to the MARCH \nmeta -analysis, including data from 33 trials, continued to show a survival \nbenefit of hyperfractionation, compared to standard fractionation (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74– 0.92; P < .001), in patients with locally advanced \nSCCHN.\n177 \nConsensus on the optimal use of  altered fractionation schedules using \neither  concomitant boost or hyperfractionation for stage III or IV oral cavity, \noropharynx, supraglottic larynx, and hypopharyngeal squamous cell \ncancers has not yet emerged among NCCN Member Institutions .175,178,179 \nFurthermore, as described below, using altered fractionation in conjunction \nwith most concurrent systemic agents remains controversial.  \nFractionation in Concurrent Chemoradiation   \nPanel members  generally agree on conventionally fractionated radiation in \ncombination with most  concurrent systemic therapies in the definitive \ntreatment setting . Most published studies have used conventional \nfractionation (at 2.0 Gy /fraction to a typical dose of 70 Gy in 7 weeks ) with \nsingle -agent high- dose cisplatin (given every 3 weeks at 100 mg/ m2).32 \nOther fraction sizes ( eg, 1.8 Gy /fraction ), other dosing schedules of \ncisplatin (eg, weekly), other single concurrent agents, concurrent multiagent systemic therapy , and altered fractionation schedules  with \nconcurrent  systemic therapy  have been evaluated alone or in combination. \nNumerous trials have shown that altered fractionation and concurrent \nchemotherapy are more efficacious than altered  fractionation alone.\n179- 181 \nHowever, conversely, the GORTEC 99- 02 trial reported that altered \nfractionation did not improve outcomes when compared with conventional fractionation given with concurrent chemotherapy .\n182,183 Similarly, RTOG \n0129 assessed accelerated fractionation with two cycles of concurrent \ncisplatin versus standard fractionation with three  cycles of concurrent \ncisplatin.

Chemoradiation should be performed by an experienced \nteam and should include state -of-the-art supportive care.  \nRadiation Techniques  \nIMRT  \nUsing contemporary computer -based planning and radiation delivery,  the \nintensity of the radiation beam can be modulated  to decrease doses to \nnormal structures with  minimal compromis e of the doses to the cancer \ntarget s.190,191 Over the last 15 years, IMRT has displaced old er techniques \nin the treatment of most H&N malignancies .192- 199 IMRT is a  highly  \nadvanced form of C RT permitting more precis e cancer target ing while \nreducing dose to normal tissues .159,200- 203  \nIMRT d ose painting , also known as SIB,  refers to the method of assigning \ndifferent dose levels to different anatomic areas. These areas are all \nsimultaneously irradiated within the same treatment fraction but receive different prescribed doses ( eg, 2.0 Gy/fraction to gross tumor, 1.6 \nGy/fraction to neck at risk for microscopic tumor, <1.0 Gy/fraction to \nparotid gland) resul ting in different total doses  to the different targets (eg, \n70 Gy, 56 Gy, <26 Gy ).\n204,205 Although dose painting has been used to \nimprove the specificity of radiation delivery to tumors and thereby reduce \nunwanted radiation of uninvolved areas, hot spots associated with higher toxicity can occur within large tumor targets due to the increasing \nheterogeneity of dose distribution that occurs when prescribing to large \nvolumes .205,206 An alternative to the dose painting or SIB approach is to \ncreate two plans, one irradiating widely to a low dose and one boosting \nspecific areas to a higher dose; the boost plan may be delivered after \ncompletion of the initial plan, or the two plans may be delivered on the \nsame day as separate fractions in twice- daily schemas (see  Principles of  \nRadiation Techniques  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers ).155,202,207,208 A meta -analysis including seven studies (n = 1049) \nshowed no significant difference in survival outcomes or grade 3 or higher \nadverse events between SIB -IMRT and sequential boost -IMRT .209 \nIMRT is now widely used in  H&N cancers  and is the predominant \ntechnique used at NCCN  Member Institutions .210,211 OS may be similar \nbetween patients treated with IMRT and those receiving conventional 3D-\nRT,192,212- 214 but both are superior to older 2D techniques. For example, a \nprospective Korean study showed that 3D and IMRT techniques were \nsuperior to 2D radiation for both PFS and OS in patients with NPC, and \nIMRT was associated with improved survival in multivariate analysis, \nparticularly in T3 –T4 tumors .215 However, IMRT has been clearly proven to \nreduce long- term toxicities. Xerostomia is a common long- term side effect \nof RT, which is ameliorated most commonly by use of IMRT, or from \napplication of drug therapy (eg, pilocarpine, cevimeline), salivary \nsubsti tutes, and other novel approaches (eg, surgical relocation of \nsubmandibular gland).197,216 -220 Importantly,  xerostomia has decreased due \nto the transition from older 2D and 3D radiotherapy techniques  to \nIMRT .192,194 Numerous phase II  and III  studies show that IMRT  decreases  \nlate toxicity (xerostomia) without compromising tumor control for \nnasopharyngeal,  oropharyngeal,  sinonasal, and other sites.  \nMultiple  randomized phase III trials support the clinical benefits of IMRT in \nH&N cancers with regard to the reduction in xerostomia.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-17 evaluated treatment of early -stage NPC with conventional RT  techniques \nversus with IMRT .217 The results showed a statistical improvement in \nsalivary flow and in patient -reported QOL  parameters .217 In the study by \nKam et al, patients with NPC were randomly assigned to either IMRT or \nconventional 2D -RT.197 At 1 year after treatment, patients in the IMRT arm \nhad significantly lower rates of clinician- rated severe xerostomia than \npatients in the 2D -RT arm (39.3% vs. 82.1%; P = .001). Salivary flow rates \nwere also higher with IMRT. The mean parotid dose was 32 Gy in the \nIMRT group and 62 Gy in the conventional group. Although a trend for \nimprovement in patient -reported dry mouth was observed after IMRT, \nrecovery was incomplete and there was no significant difference in \npatient -reported outcomes between the two  arms. The authors concluded \nthat other salivary glands may also be important and merit protection.  \nFinally, data from a phase III randomized trial in the United Kingdom \n(PARSPORT) indicate that IMRT decreases xerostomia when compared \nwith conventional RT in patients with non- NPC cancers .192 In this trial, \npatients with T1– T4, N0 –N3, M0 disease were treated to a total dose of 60 \nor 65 Gy in 30 fractions either with conventional RT (ie, parallel opposed \n3D technique) or with IMRT; 80 patients with oropharyngeal and 14 \npatients with hypopharyngeal tumors wer e included. Grade 2 or worse \n(LENT -SOMA scale) xerostomia 2 years after treatment was seen in 83% \nof patients receiving conventional RT versus 29% of patients in the IMRT \ngroup ( P < .0001). No differences were seen in the rates of lo coregional \ncontrol or survival. A fourth trial, GORTEC 2004- 01, showed that dose -\nescalated IMRT (50 Gy in 25 fractions followed by a sequential boost of 25 \nGy in 10 fractions), delivered concurrently with cisplatin, reduced xerostomia in patients with locally advanced SCCHN, as compared to the \ncontrol arm of 3D -RT (50 Gy in 25 fractions followed by a sequential boost \nof 20 Gy in 10 frac tions) delivered concurrently with cisplatin (23% vs. \n63%, respectively, after 1 year, and 11% vs. 45%, respectively, after 3 \nyears ).\n221 Locoregional control did not significantly differ between the two \nstudy arms.  IMRT likely  reduc es other long- term toxicit ies due to decreased radiation \ndoses to structures such as pharyngeal constrictors, larynx, temporal \nlobes, mandible, auditory structures  (including cochlea) , and optic \nstructures .160,197,217,222- 227 For instance, in a phase III randomized control \ntrial (RCT) from the UK and Ireland, a dysphagia- optimized IMRT \nintervention in which the constrictor muscles of the pharynx were spared \nimproved swallowing outcomes at 12 months compared to standard IMRT \n(P = .037) in patients with early stage and locally advanced cancers of the \noropharynx or hypopharynx .228 Retrospective analyses including 2993 \npatients who received RT for treatment of H&N cancer showed that \npatients who received IMRT had a shorter duration of feeding tube \nplacement, compared to those who received 3D -RT (P = .03).229 There are \nnumerous other specific advantages of IMRT that apply to challenging anatomical situations. IMRT is particularly useful in avoiding excess \nradiation of the optic pathway in patients with sinonasal malignancies .\n222 \nHowever, the randomized phase III COSTAR trial did not show that cochlear -sparing IMRT significantly reduced hearing loss in patients with \nparotid tumors, compared to 3D -CRT.\n227 One caveat is that additional care \nmust be taken when using IMRT  as it can create unanticipated toxicities to \norgans  unexpectedly  radiated in the beam path; a careful and informed \nexamination of all organs potentially affected by these novel distributions \nof the radiation dose is mandatory .230,231 \nProton Beam Therapy  \nAt present, proton therapy is the predominant particle therapy under active \nclinical investigation in the United States .232- 235 Proton therapy has been \nreported in the treat ment of  skull base tumors, oropharyngeal cancers, \nsinonasal malignancies,  adenoid cystic carcinomas,  and MMs.236- 244 \nProton therapy has typically been used to treat patients with the most \nchallenging disease configurations , for which other RT options were not \nfelt to be safe or of any benefit .239,245,246 Proton therapy has also been PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

A systematic review and meta- analysis of non -comparative \nobservation studies concluded that patients with malignant diseases of the \nnasal cavity and paranasal sinuses who received proton therapy appeared \nto have better outcomes than those receiving photon therapy .247 A review \nof proton therapy in patients with H&N  cancers included 14 retrospective \nreviews and four prospective nonrandomized studies .233 The 2-  to 5-year \nlocal control rates were as low as 17.5% for T4 or recurrent paranasal \nsinus cancers and as high as 95% for other  tumor  types.  \nIn institutional series , the reported  outcomes for proton therapy have \nincluded good locoregional control, freedom from distant metastasis, and \nacceptable toxicity .233,241,244,248- 251 PBT may be associated with even \ngreater normal tissue sparing without sacrificing target coverage, which is \nhypothesized to be associated with reduced toxicity compared to IMRT.248 \nThis may be a particular advantage in cases of reirradiation.252 \nHowever, the planning and delivery of PBT continues to develop, and occasional fatal outcomes have been reported with proton therapy due to \nuncertainties associated with these evolving technologies, including a \nsmall number of  deaths secondary to brainstem injury  in children.\n253- 255 In \ngeneral,  clinicians have reported low rates of serious toxicities when using \nstrict dose limits for proton therapy .245,256 However, disadvantageous and \nadvantageous outcomes continue to be more fully documented as the \nclinical experience accrues. A pooled analysis of 17 studies including \npatients with head and neck cancer treated with PBT showed a rate of \ngrade ≥3 osteoradionecrosis is 0.01 (95% C I, 0.01–0.03) ,257 although \nretrospective analyses have shown increased potential for this \ncomplication in single- institutional experiences.258 In patients who have tumors that are periocular in location and/or invade the orbit, skull base, \nand/or cavernous sinus, or whose primary tumors extend intracranially or \nexhibit extensive perineural invasion, highly conformal dose distributions \nare crucial, and proton therapy may provide certain unique advantages. In \npatients with these types of tumors who are being treated with curative intent and/or have long life expectancies, PBT may offer the opportunity \nfor lower late -onset toxicities .\n259 \nAs described above, nonrandomized institutional reports and a small number of systematic reviews have shown that PBT is safe to use in a \ncontrolled setting where specialized physics support is available. However, \nwithout high- quality prospective comparative data, it is premature to \nconclude that proton therapy has been established as invariably superior \nto other modern radiation techniques such as IMRT, particularly with \nregard to tumor control . An accurate comparison of benefits  to other RT \noptions w ould i deally take place in the controlled setting of randomized \nclinical trials.  \nGiven the unique abilities of PBT to treat more difficult tumors, randomized \ntrials may not be possible for some scenarios. In these cases,  an \nalternative approach may be to develop prospectively maintained databases to raise the quality of institutional reports of clinical \nexperiences .\n255 In cancers of the oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, \nnasopharynx, paranasal sinus, and salivary glands, as well as MM, and unknown primary tumors of the H&N, the Panel agrees that proton therapy \nshould be considered when normal tissue constraints cannot be met by \nphoton- based therapy, or when photon- based therapy causes compromise \nof standard radiation dosing to tumor or postoperative volumes. The Panel \nsupports ongoing efforts to develop models to predict which patients would \nbenefit the most from proton therapy and the development of higher -level \nand/or randomized data demonstrating greater efficacy or meaningful QOL gains potentially achieved with PBT.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-19 Brachytherapy  \nBrachytherapy is a uniquely conformal modality that is considered to be \neffective and safe when delivered by an experienced team of practitioners. \nBrachytherapy  is now necessary less often because of improved local \ncontrol  and lower toxicities obtained with IMRT with or without systemic \ntherapy. However, brachytherapy still has an important role in cancers of \nthe lip and oral cavity (see Cancer of the Oral Cavity [Including Mucosal \nLip]: Principles of Radiation Therapy  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and \nNeck Cancer s).260 Brachytherapy may have a role in other select clinical \nscenarios such as reirradiation, as a boost for highly refractory disease or \na positive surgical margin, or when extremely conformal radiation delivery \nis needed to a very well -defined tumor location;  these are unique \nsituations arising from challenging clinical circumstances and limited availability of head and neck brachytherapy expertise.  \nThe potential for brachytherapy to reduce side effects, because of its \nuniquely conformal radiation dose distribution, remains a matter of debate. \nA randomized trial investigated the reduction in xerostomia at 6 months, \nassessed using \n99mTc salivary scintigraphy , in patients receiving IMRT or \nIMRT combined with brachytherapy in patients with T1– T2 N0 M0 \noropharyngeal SCC .261 Ninety patients were randomized, but evaluation \nwas not possible in 20 patients at 6 months. In the remaining 70 \nparticipants, scintigraphy -determined xerostomia rates were 14% and 44% \nin the brachytherapy -containing and IMRT- alone arms, respectively. \nHowever, it is uncertain if these results would be reproduced in centers \nwithout high volume and expertise in this modality.  \nStereotactic Body Radiation Therapy  \nStereotactic body RT  (SBRT) is an advanced technique of external beam \nRT (EBRT)  that delivers large ablative doses of radiation in a limited \nnumber of fractions . Advantages of SBRT include shorter treatment time, \npromising local control rates, and higher but acceptable toxicity depending on the specific location treated.262 There is currently insufficient evidence \nto recommend SBRT routinely for treatment of H&N cancers, but the NCCN Panel acknowledges that it might be beneficial in the settings of re-\nirradiation, palliation, or for older adults .\n263- 265 One emerging setting where \nSBRT has been of increasing interest is oligometastatic disease. In the GORTEC OMET phase II trial, in which 69 patients having oligometastatic \nH&N cancers were randomized to receive SBRT with or without \nEXTREME- based chemotherapy, the median survival was 42.3 months \n(95% CI, 26.5– not reached) with chemotherapy -SBRT and 41.1 months \n(95% CI, 32.1– 66.9) with SBRT alone.\n266 \nSBRT has been reported in numerous retrospective review s in the \nreirradiation setting.267 Careful anticipation of toxicity is especially \nimportant in planning the delivery of this modality to a patient. Small prospective studies have aimed at the purpose of demonstrating safety \nand feasibility in combination with systemic therapies including c etuximab \nor cisplatin but continued caution is advised due to the relatively limited experience with combining these modalities .\n268,269 \nFollow -up After RT  \nFor patients whose cancer has been treated with RT, the recommended follow- up (see Follow -up Recommendations  in the NCCN Guidelines for \nHead and Neck Cancers) includes an assessment of thyroid function (ie, the thyroid- stimulating hormone [TSH] level should be determined every \n6–12 months) and surveillance- oriented physical examination, symptom \nassessment and supportive care, and/or imaging as clinically indicated. \nIncreased TSH levels have been detected in 20% to 25% of patients who  \nhave received neck irradiation.\n270- 272 Changes in TSH may indicate thyroid \ngland dysfunction or hypopituitarism if the skull base was irradiated.

This \nsection describes systemic therapy for locally advanced SCCHN with \nconcurrent or sequential RT- based treatment. In patients with  newly \ndiagnosed recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, testing for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) should be performed to \nguide treatment decisions, and next -generation sequencing (NGS) \ngenomic profiling for biomarker identification of actionable alterations may \nbe considered to guide treatment options. For detailed recommendations \non combination and single- agent systemic therapy for metastatic (M1) \ndisease (without surgery or RT treatment), see the section below under Very Advanced Head and Neck Cancers . Systemic therapy/RT for \nlocoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer is described below under \nCancer of the Nasopharynx . \nPrimary Systemic Therapy with C oncurrent RT  \nRandomized trials143,273- 281 and meta -analyses282- 286 show ed significantly \nimproved OS, DFS, and loc oregional  control when a systemic therapy  and \nRT regimen  (concomitant or, less commonly, sequential)  was compared \nwith RT alone for locally advanced disease.  Limited data are available \ncomparing the efficacy of different chemoradiotherapy regimens.  \nHigh-dose cisplatin plus RT is the most studied effective  systemic \ntherapy/RT regimen and typically uses conventional fractionation or RT at \n2.0 Gy per fraction to 70 Gy administered over  7 weeks with  concurrent  \nhigh- dose cisplatin 100 mg/m2 given every 3 weeks for up to three \ndoses .156,273 Because of perceived lower toxicity, low -dose once -a-week \ncisplatin has been studied. A randomized phase III trial compared cisplatin 30 mg/m2 given once weekly to high- dose cisplatin, both given with RT to \npatients with locally advanced SCCHN .142 The primary endpoint was \nlocoregional control. Most patients (93%) received study treatment in the \nadjuvant setting. Locoregional control was inferior in the cisplatin 30 \nmg/m2 weekly arm compared to the high- dose cisplatin arm. The 2 -year \nlocoregional control rate was 58.5% in the low -dose weekly cisplatin arm \nand 73.1% in the high -dose cisplatin arm ( P = .014). Acute toxicities of \ngrade 3 or greater were less common in the low -dose weekly arm \ncompared to the high- dose cisplatin arm (71.6% vs. 84.6%; P  = .006). A \nsystematic review and meta- analysis including six randomized studies with \n554 patients with SCCHN showed that OS, PFS, and toxicity did not \nsignificantly differ between low -dose weekly cisplatin and high- dose \ncisplatin (both given with RT).287 Based on all of the available data, high-\ndose cisplatin with RT is the preferred systemic therapy/RT regimen for \nlocally advanced SCCHN. However, if the clinician has a patient -specific \nconcern about the toxicity of high- dose cisplatin, a weekly low -dose \ncisplatin regimen at a dose of 40 mg/ m2/week may be substituted. The \ncategories of evidence for other perceived better tolerated systemic regimens are lower than for high- dose cisplatin. In the absence of \nconfirmatory and mature prospective comparison trials, it is unclear whether low -dose weekly cisplatin is either less toxic or equally efficacious \nas high- dose cisplatin.  \nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  overexpression is common in \nSCCHN and is associated with poor survival outcomes.\n288,289 Bonner et al \nrandomly assigned 424 patients with locally advanced stage III –IV \nsquamous cell carcinomas of the hypopharynx, oropharynx, and larynx  to \nreceive definitive RT  with or without cetuximab.290 Locoregional control \nand median OS  (49 vs. 29.3 months ; P = .03) were significantly improved \nin patients treated with RT  and cetuximab compared to RT  alone.

No improvement in PFS was reported in those \nwith oropharyngeal cancer, regardless of p -16 positivity, in the cetuximab \narm. Consistent with the original data, rates of toxicity were higher in the cetuximab arm compared to  the RT + cisplatin arm, at 61.3% and 57.4%, \nrespectively. In the phase III GORTEC 2007 -01 trial, cetuximab combined \nwith carboplatin/5- FU and RT was compared to cetuximab and RT.\n294 \nThree- year PFS (52.3% vs. 40.5%, respectively; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57–\n0.94; P = .015) and locoregional failure (21.6% vs. 38.8%, respectively; \nHR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38– 0.76; P < .001) rates were better with the \ncetuximab and carboplatin/5- FU regimen, but OS and distant metastases \nrates were not significantly improved. Grade 3 or 4 mucositis (73% vs. \n61%, respectively; P = .014) and hospitalization for toxicity (42% vs. 22%, \nrespectively; P < .001) were more prevalent in patients who received \ncetuximab combined with carboplatin/5- FU and RT. Based on all of these \ndata, cetuximab combined with chemoradiation is not recommended.  \nIn three randomized phase III trials, cetuximab and RT was compared to \ncisplatin and RT as a deintensification treatment strategy for HPV -positive \nlocally advanced oropharyngeal cancer. These trials showed that cetuximab and RT was inferior to cisplatin and RT (in terms of OS) and \nwas not better tolerated.\n295,296 In the RTOG 1016 trial, 849 patients with locally advanced HPV -positive oropharyngeal cancer were randomized to \nreceive accelerated IMRT with either cetuximab or cisplatin.295 After a \nmedian follow -up of 4.5 years, the cetuximab arm did not meet the \ncriterion for noninferiority (based on 5 -year OS). Five -year OS was 77.9% \nfor the cetuximab arm and 84.6% for the cisplatin arm. PFS and risk of \nlocoregional failure were significantly worse in the cetuximab arm \ncompared to the cisplatin arm (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.29– 2.29; P < .001 for \nPFS; HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.35 –3.10; P < .001 for locoregional failure). Five -\nyear PFS and locoregional failure rates were 67.3% and 17.3% for the \ncetuximab arm and 78.4% and 9.9% for the cisplatin arm, respectively. In \nthe randomized phase III De- ESCALaTE HPV trial, cetuximab and RT was \ncompared to cisplatin and RT in 334 patients with locally advanced p16 -\npositive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.296 Patients given \ncisplatin and RT had significantly better 2- year OS (97.5% vs. 89.4%, \nrespectively; HR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.7– 14.7; P = .001) and a lower recurrence \nrate (6.0% vs. 16.1%, respectively; HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.6– 7.2; P < .001) \ncompared to patients given cetuximab and RT.  In the multicenter TROG \n12.01 trial, 189 patients with intermediate -risk HPV -positive oropharyngeal \ncancer were randomized to receive 70 Gy RT with either low -dose weekly \ncisplatin (40 mg/m2/week ) or cetuximab .297 The 3- year failure- free survival \nwas 93% in the RT/cisplatin arm and 80% in the RT/cetuximab arm ( P = \n.015). These three phase III trials demonstrated that cetuximab and RT \nwas inferior to cisplatin and RT in patients with HPV -positive locally \nadvanced oropharyngeal cancer .295- 297 When c oncurrent systemic \ntherapy/RT is recommended for treatment of loc oregionally advanced \nHPV-positive  oropharyngeal cancer, the Panel asserts that high- dose \ncisplatin is the preferred systemic agent, although low -dose weekly \ncisplatin is also an option .

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-22 Induction Chemotherapy  \nThe role of induction chemotherapy in the management of locally \nadvanced SCCHN has generated considerable discussion and debate \nwithin the NCCN Panel. The lack of consensus among NCCN Member \nInstitutions despite the extensive discussion is illustrated by t he category 3 \nrecommendation (ie, major disagreement) for induction chemotherapy for the management of locoregionally advanced p16-negative and p16-\npositive oropharyngeal  cancer . However in other sites of disease (glottic \nand supraglottic larynx and hypopharynx), category 2A and 2B \nrecommendations for induction chemotherapy are based on an update \nfrom the RTOG 91- 11 trial .\n298 For selected patients with hypopharyngeal \nand laryngeal cancers (with less than T4a in extent, for which total laryngectomy is indicated), induction chemotherapy —used as part of a \nlarynx preservation strategy —is listed as a category 2A designation.  \nPanel members feel that induction chemotherapy should only be \nadministered at sites with expertise in these regimens because of \nchallenges associated with appropriate patient selection and management \nof treatment -related toxicities .\n299 Residual toxicity from induction \nchemotherapy may complicate the subsequent delivery of definitive RT or \nsystemic therapy/RT.   \nA summary of the data helps provide perspective on the NCCN Panel’s \nrecommendations. Most randomized trials comparing induction \nchemotherapy followed by RT and/or surgery to locoregional treatment \nalone did not show an improvement in OS with the incorporation of \ninduction chemotherapy .284 However, in some studies, a lower rate of \ndistant metastases was noted with induction chemotherapy.300 Also, a \ncorrelation was noted between favorable tumor response to induction \nchemotherapy and durable disease control with subsequent RT .300,301 \nThus, the hypothesis was developed that induction chemotherapy could \nfacilitate organ preservation, avoid morbid surgery, and improve QOL of patients although OS was not improved. Because total laryngectomy is \namong the procedures most feared by patients,302 larynx preservation was \nthe focus of initial studies of induction chemotherapy.  \nTwo randomized studies —the Veterans Affairs (VA) Laryngeal Cancer \nStudy Group trial in advanced larynx cancer and the EORTC trial in advanced hypopharynx cancer —established the role of induction \ncisplatin/5 -FU followed by definitive RT in responding patients as an \nalternative treatment to total laryngectomy and postoperative RT, offering \npotential larynx preservation without compromise in OS (see Cancer of the \nLarynx  and Cancer of the Hypopharynx  in this Discussion ).\n300,301 Yet, even \nin this setting, the utilization of induction chemotherapy has decreased \nwith time. Randomized trials and related meta- analyses indicated that \nconcurrent systemic therapy/RT (with cisplatin being the best -studied \nagent) offered superior locoregi onal tumor control and OS compared to RT \nalone,273,276- 278,280,282,283,285,286 and shorter duration of therapy compared to \ninduction therapy followed by radiation. Meta- analyses reported that \nconcurrent systemic therapy/RT was more efficacious than an induction \nchemotherapy followed by definitive RT strategy .284,303 In the larynx \npreservation setting, the Intergroup 91- 11 trial compared RT alone, \nconcurrent cisplatin/RT, and induction cisplatin/5 -FU followed by RT; all \narms offered surgery for locally relapsed/refractory disease. The \nconcurrent cisplatin/RT arm had t he highest larynx preservation rate (see \nCancer of the Larynx  in this Discussion ).304 Long- term follow -up of the \n91-11 trial confirmed that concomitant systemic therapy/RT improved the \nlarynx preservation rate and that induction chemotherapy followed by RT \nwas not superior to RT alone.298 However, OS did not differ among the \nthree treatment arms.  \nNonetheless, interest in the role of induction chemotherapy endured for \nseveral reasons. First, advances in surgery, RT, and concurrent systemic \ntherapy/RT have yielded improvements in locoregional control; thus, the PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Three phase III trials \ncompared induction cisplatin plus 5 -FU with or without the addition of a \ntaxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel)  followed by the same locoregional \ntreatment in both groups. Results showed significantly improved outcomes \n(response rates, DFS , or OS,  depending on the trial) for pa tients in the \nthree -drug induction group (taxane plus cisplatin and 5- FU) compared to \nthose receiving two drugs (cisplatin plus 5- FU).\n308- 311 A randomized phase \nIII trial in the larynx preservation setting similarly showed superior larynx \npreservation outcome with induction docetaxel/cisplatin/5- FU (TPF) \ncompared to cisplatin/5 -FU.312,313 A meta -analysis including five RCTs ( N = \n1772) showed that the TPF induction chemotherapy regimen, compared to \ncisplatin plus 5- FU, was associated with reduced risk of death (HR, 0.72; \n95% CI, 0.63– 0.83; P < .001) and greater reductions in progression (HR, \n0.78; 95% CI, 0.69– 0.87; P < .001), locoregional failure (HR, 0.79; 95% \nCI, 0.66 –0.94; P = .007), and distant failure (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45– 0.89; \nP = .009).314 \nWhether adding induction chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiation \n(versus RT alone) results in a clear advantage in OS continues is \nunclear .315- 317 Both the DeCIDE and the PARADIGM phase III trials did not \nshow a survival advantage with the incorporation of induction \nchemotherapy  followed by concurrent chemoradiation.316,317 In patients \nwith stage III or IV SCCHN, a  randomized phase II study  compared \ninduction TPF followed by concurrent cisplatin/5 -FU and RT versus concurrent cisplatin/5- FU and RT alone. A higher radiologic complete \nresponse rate was reported with the incorporation of induction \nchemotherapy .318 Results from a larger follow -up study suggest a survival \nadvantage.319  \nOther induction chemotherapy regimens have been evaluated in phase II \ntrials. The ECOG -ACRIN trial (E2303) showed promising results in terms \nof primary site response and survival for cetuximab, paclitaxel, and \ncarboplatin as induction chemotherapy, followed by concurrent systemic \ntherapy/RT with the same drug regimen in patients with stage III or IV \nSCCHN ( N = 74),320 but the benefit of induction chemotherapy requires \nvalidation using a randomized design. Two phase II studies evaluated the feasibility of TPF with cetuximab followed by concurrent systemic \ntherapy/RT or RT alone .\n321,322 The DeLOS -II trial showed that TPF \nfollowed by RT, with cetuximab administered throughout, was feasible but \nnot superior to TPF and subsequent RT without cetuximab.321 An EORTC \ntrial evaluating this induction regimen followed by concurrent systemic therapy/RT was stopped prematurely due to numerous serious adverse \nevents .\n322 \nThere is a lack of consensus regarding the most appropriate concurrent \nsystemic therapy/RT regimen to be administered following induction \nchemotherapy .323 Panel members agree  that weekly carboplatin is a \nreasonable agent to use with RT.316 Intent -to-treat analyses from the \nrandomized phase II TREMPLIN study showed no significant difference in \nlarynx preservation rate at 3 months in patients with locally advanced \nlarynx or hypopharynx cancers who received either cisplatin (95%) or \ncetuximab (93%) with RT following induction TPF.324 Although surgery for \npersistent disease was feasible only in patients who received cetuximab with RT following TPF, rate of treatment failure was lower in patients who \nreceived cisplatin with RT.

A randomized phase III \nnoninferiority trial showed no differences in PFS, overall response rates, or \nadverse event rates between cisplatin and cetuximab, delivered \nconcurrently with RT following induction TPF.326 \nResults of the phase III GORTEC 2007 -02 trial, in which 370 patients with \nbulky nodal disease (N2b, N2c, or N3) were randomized to receive \ncarboplatin/5 -FU with RT or TPF followed by cetuximab/RT, showed no \nsignificant differences between the study arms for survival outcomes and \nlocal control .327 There was a trend towards a lower rate of distant \nmetastases in the TPF arm (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30– 0.99; P = .05).  \nThe Panel recommends cetuximab administered concurrent with RT \nfollowing induction chemotherapy only in select circumstances such as in \npatients who are cisplatin- ineligible. Low -dose weekly cisplatin with RT \nfollowing induction chemotherapy is a category 2B option,  based on \nextrapolation .316,324 However, because of toxicity concerns, high- dose \ncisplatin (100 mg/m2 every 21 day s × 3 doses) is not recommended with \nRT after induction cisplatin- based chemotherapy .315,324  \nThe data summarized in this section highlights overarching concerns that \nany efficacy gains of a strategy of induction chemotherapy followed by RT \nmay be offset by the poorer patient adherence with the RT- based part of \ntreatment and the alternative option of shorter duration, better -tolerated, \nand effective concurrent systemic therapy/RT regimens. Because of these  \nuncertaint ies, enrollment of patients in appropriate clinical trials  of \ninduction chemotherapy is encouraged.  Outside of a clinical trial, \nconcur rent systemic therapy/RT—with high -dose cisplatin preferred —is \nconsidered the gold standard by many NCCN Panel Members  (see \nPrinciples of Systemic Therapy  for Non- Nasopharyngeal Cancers  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers ).138-141,273,328 When \ninduction chemotherapy is used, data show that the addition of a taxane to cisplatin/5 -FU (of which TPF is the most extensively studied) is more \nefficacious than cisplatin/5- FU.\n314,323 Therefore, when used as induction \nchemotherapy for SCCHN, docetaxel with cisplatin/5- FU is a category 1 \npreferred recommendation. Paclitaxel/cisplatin/5- FU and \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel with or without cetuximab are also options for \ninduction chemotherapy, t hough the latter option is category 2B based on \nless Panel consensus .309,329- 331 \nPrinciples of Supportive Care \nNutrition  \nThe Principles of Nutrition : Management and Supportive Care section in \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers  outlines nutritional \nmanagement and supportive care for patients with H&N cancers  who are \nprone to weight loss, which can often be severe, as a result of treatment -\nrelated toxicity, disease, and health behaviors  such as poor nutritional \nhabits .332,333 Patients with H&N cancers are also at risk for dehydration. \nThe multidisciplinary expertise of a  registered dietitian and a speech-\nlanguage/swallowing therapist  should be utilized throughout the continuum \nof care .  \nPatients who have had significant weight loss ( 5% body weight loss over 1 \nmonth, or 10% body weight  loss over 6 months) need nutritional \nevaluation and close monitoring of their weight to prevent further weight \nloss.334,335 In addition, all patients should receive nutritional evaluation \nbefore and after treatment to assess the need for interventions ( eg, en teral \nsupport via feeding tubes ).336,337 Lymphedema of the head and neck \ncommonly occurs in patients and is associated with increased symptom \nburden (eg, negative cosmetic impact, trouble breathing, swallow \ndysfunction, and pain).338-340 Fibrosis can also occur.341 As lymphedema \nand fibrosis negatively impact function and QOL, evaluation and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Patient referrals to occupational therapy to \nlearn massage techniques (eg, lymphatic decompression therapy) or to be \nfitted for custom -made compression devices may be warranted. Patients \nare also at risk for problems with speech  and/or swallowing. Treatment \nand/or the progression of their disease may cause deterioration in their \nability to speak and/or swallow.342- 345 Evaluation by a speech-\nlanguage/swallowing therapist is needed before , during,  and after \ntreatment to help mitigate potential problems.346- 348 Patients are also at risk \nfor dental problems (see Principles of Oral/ Dental Evaluation and \nManagement in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Long -\nterm swallowing and dental dysfunction are particular risks that are \nworsened by multimodality therapy and require long- term specialized \nattention.  \nOral mucositis, or tissue damage, is common in patients treated with RT \nfor H&N cancers,349- 354 although use of advanced RT techniques (eg, \nIMRT) may decrease the incidence and duration of this damage.349,355,356 \nOral mucositis causes pain in the mouth, which may affect the ability to eat \nand drink.349,352,353,357 Oral mucositis may be associated with breaks and/or \ndelays in treatment, as well as hospitalization.350,351,353 Oral mucositis is \nmore severe in patients receiving concurrent systemic therapy/RT.353 The \nMultinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and the \nInternational Society of Oral Oncology have published clinical practice \nguidelines for treatment of oral mucositis, although there are few high-\nquality studies in this area.358,359 Prevention and management of mucositis \nconstitute an unmet medical need.  \nIn the randomized phase III Alliance A221304 trial, patients with H&N \ncancer who were treated with RT ( N = 275) were randomized to receive a \ndiphenhydramine- lidocaine- antacid mouthwash, doxepin mouthwash, or a \nplacebo.360 The reduction in mucositis pain during the first 4 hours of \ntreatment was significantly greater in the patients who received the diphenhydramine- lidocaine- antacid mouthwash ( P = .004) or the doxepin \nmouthwash ( P = .02), compared to the placebo. The practicality and \neffectiveness of the doxepin- based regimen through an entire course of \nRT is not established. Gabapentin is also under investigation for treatment \nof pain from oral mucositis. In a prospective randomized pilot study, \npatients with H&N cancer who were treated with chemoradiation (N = 79) \nwere randomized to receive gabapentin or usual care.361 Patients \nrandomized to receive gabapentin reported a greater reduction in pain, \ncompared to patients randomized to receive usual care ( P = .004). A small \nretrospective study including patients with H&N cancer treated with RT or systemic therapy/RT showed that treatment with gabapentin for pain from \noral mucositis is associated with a reduced need for narcotic pain \nmedication and high doses of opioids.\n352 A single -institution study \ndemonstrated that very -high-dose prophylactic gabapentin (2700 mg daily) \nalso reduced the number of patients requiring narcotics.362 An unplanned \nsecondary analysis of two consecutive prospective clinical trials showed \nthat high- dose prophylactic gabapentin (3600 mg daily) was associated \nwith greater time to first use of opioids, compared to 900 mg daily ( P < \n.001).363 The toxicity of large dosages should not be underestimated and \nwas not adequately explored in these studies. Larger scale studies are \nawaited to fully assess the generalizability and toxicity of this dosing \nschedule. In a randomized double- blind placebo- controlled study from \nChina (N = 128), patients with RT- related neuropathic pain who received \npregabalin reported greater pain relief ( P = .006 for 30% pain relief and P \n= .003 for 50% pain relief) and greater pain intensity reduction ( P = .003) \nthan patients who received a placebo.364 The Panel recommends \nconsideration of doxepin, diphenhydramine- lidocaine- antacid mouthwash, \npregabalin (category 2B), or gabapentin for pain related to oral mucositis, \nas clinically indicated and as tolerated.  \nNCCN Panel m embers agree that reactive feeding tube placement , in \nwhich patients are first given oral nutrition supplements, followed by PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Advantages of prophylactic tube placement include \nreductions in hospitalizations and treatment -related weight loss, as well as \nimproved QOL.368 However, this practice is also associated with \ndisadvantages, such as longer dependence on feeding tubes and worse long- term functional outcomes, compared to a reactive approach.\n368 The \nNCCN Guidelines provide recommendations for prophylactic tube \nplacement, which should be strongly considered in high- risk patients ( eg, \nthose with severe pretreatment weight loss, ongoing dehydration or dysphagia, significant comorbidities, severe aspiration risk, anticipated \nswallowing issues).\n333,335 In patients with adequate swallowing function, \ncare must be given with the help of speech and language pathologists to \nensure that patients continue to swallow to prevent severe fibrosis and \npermanent feeding tube dependence (see Principles of Nutrition: \nManagement and Supportive Care in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).  With swallowing therapy, adequate pain control, and \naccess to IV fluids, feeding tubes can be avoided in most patients. The NCCN Guidelines do not recommend prophylactic tube  placement in \nlower -risk patients ( ie, those without significant pretreatment weight loss, significant aspiration, or severe dysphagia), although these patients ’ \nweight s should be carefully monitored during and after treatment.\n \nOral/ Dental Evaluation and Management  \nPatients with H&N cancers are at risk of oral and dental complications after surgery or RT because of treatment -induced xerostomia and salivary \ngland dysfunction, which are associated with increased dental caries .\n345,349,353,369- 373 In addition, RT to the salivary and oral soft tissues is \nalso associated with bone demineralization and trismus of the masticatory \nmuscles. Using IMRT and limiting the RT dose to the salivary glands and \noral cavity have been shown to decrease xerostomia and damage to the \nteeth.369,370,374- 380 Dental/oral evaluation and management can help \ndecrease dental caries and associated problems such as dentoalveolar infection and osteoradionecrosis.\n349,353,373,374,380 -389 \nThe recommended dental/oral evaluations before, during, and after RT are \ndescribed in detail in the algorithm and are summarized here. A dental/oral \ntreatment plan needs to be implemented before RT and should include the \nfollowing: 1) eliminating potential  sources of infection; 2) if performing \ndental extractions, allowing adequate time for healing before RT; 3) \ntreating active dental caries and periodontal disease; 4) treating oral \ncandidiasis; and 5) educating patients about preventive strategies, \nincludi ng the elimination of sugar -based candies or gum for dry mouth \nprevention.373,390 Some of the general strategies to decrease oral and \ndental complications include: 1) decrease dry mouth (eg, by using salivary \nsubstitutes, stimulation with xylitol lozenges or discs that adhere to the \ngums, teeth or dentures, and the minimization of alcohol and caffeine \nconsumption)391- 393; 2) reduce risk of dental caries (eg, by using high-\npotency topical fluoride)353,381,394; 3) decrease dentoalveolar infection (eg, \nwith frequent evaluations to detect and treat disease promptly); 4) prevent \nand address osteoradionecrosis; 5) decrease trismus of the masticatory \nmuscles (eg, by using custom mouth -opening devices  to maintain range of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Major dental work such as extractions can \nbe problematic for an irradiated mandible. Therefore, any planned \nprocedures should be performed by dentists well -acquainted with this \ntreatment setting and potential related morbidities, and in consultation with \nthe treating radiation oncologist.  \nDuring and after treatment, the goals of dental/oral management include: \n1) addressing xerostomia; 2) preventing trismus; and 3) detecting and \ntreating oral candidiasis.353,373,390 Additional goals after treatment include: \n1) preventing and treating dental caries; 2) surveying the mouth for early \nsigns of post -radiation osteonecrosis; and 3) preventing oral \ncandidiasis.353,373,390 \nCancer of the Oral Cavity (Including Mucosal Lip) \nThe oral cavity includes the buccal mucosa, upper and lower alveolar ridges, retromolar trigone, floor of mouth, hard palate, and the anterior \ntwo-thirds of the tongue. It has a rich lymphatic network, with initial \nregional spread typically occurring to ly mph nodes in levels I through III.  \nRegional node involvement at presentation is evident in approximately \n30% of patients, but the risk varies by subsite. The risk of lymph node \nmetastases is influenced by location , size, tumor thickness, depth of \ninvasion,  and tumor grade. For example, primaries of the alveolar ridge \nand hard palate rarely involve the neck, whereas occult neck metastasis is common (50% –60%) in patients with anterior (oral) tongue cancers. \nThe incidence of lymph node metastases in cancer of the mucosal  lip \n(especially early -stage lower lip) is historically low based on AJCC 7\nth \nedition staging ,399 averaging <10%, with higher rates seen  in T3/4 disease or with oral commissure involvement. With depth of invasion \nnow incorporated into T staging in the AJCC 8th edition ,400 indications for \nneck dissection in T2 mucosal lip lesions will likely require clarification. Specifically, early stage lesions with depth of invasion >10 mm would \nnow be upstaged to T3.  \nCancers of the lip mucosa are now staged as oral cavity cancers (see \nTable 1). The AJCC TNM staging system reflects tumor size, extension, \nand nodal disease.\n400 In the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging \nManual, cancers of the external vermilion lip are staged as cutaneous carcinomas of the H&N, due to their similarity to non- melanoma skin \ncancer .\n400 For treatment guidance, see the NCCN Guidelines for \nSquamous Cell Skin Cancer (available at www.NCCN.org ). \nWorkup  \nImaging to assess mandibular involvement and regional nodal disease, \nalong with a thorough dental evaluation is particularly important for staging \n(see Table 1) and treatment planning in oral cavity cancers. A complete \nH&N examination, biopsy, and other st udies (see Cancer of the Oral \nCavity  (Including Mucosal Lip) : Workup in the NCCN Guidelines for Head \nand Neck Cancers) are also recommended . For patients likely to receive \nRT (primary or adjuvant), pretreatment dental evaluation and ongoing dental care are  critical to minimize the risk of osteoradionecrosis. Nutrition, \nspeech, and swallowing evaluations are recommended for selected at -risk \npatients (see Principles of Nutrition : Management  and Supportive Care  in \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).  \nTreatment  \nTreatment is based on clinical stage, patient medical status, anticipated \nfunctional and cosmetic outcomes, and patient preference.

A nonsurgical approach may also \nbe considered when surgical morbidity is high ( eg, total glossectomy) or \nwhen the patient prefers organ preservation with systemic therapy and radiation. Postoperative radiation is recommended based on pathological \nfindings and disease stage. Treatment decisions are informed by TN stage \nand the risk of nodal involvement in N0 disease (see Cancer of the Oral \nCavity  (Including Mucosal Lip)  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancer s).  \nMultidisciplinary team involvement is essential for this site due to the \nimpact on mastication, swallowing, and speech.

Thus, organ preservation via systemic therapy is less frequently pursued in the oral cavity, being \nconsidered generally less effective for locoregional control than upfront \nsurgery.  Definitive RT may be offered to patients who are medically \ninoperable, decline surgery ,\n401 or need local control in incurable cases.  \nFor early -stage oral cavity cancers, the preferred initial treatment is  \nsurgical resection of the primary tumor.  Most patients undergo ipsilateral \nor bilateral neck dissection, guided by factors such as depth of invasion, \nproximity to the midline, and tumor location (see  Head and Neck Surgery: \nNeck Dissection  above). Although the risk of occult metastasis to level s IV \nand V in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity is low, study results  \nare mixed.  Therefore , the role of surgical resection with extended \nsupraomohyoid neck dissection remains  uncertain.402 The benefit of \nelective neck dissection in early -stage, node -negative oral cavity cancers \nis debated and often based on the relative risk of occult metastasis from \nthe subsite. A depth of invasion ≥4 mm is a key indication for elective neck \ndissection.403 A meta -analysis of five RCTs and 28 retrospective studies (n = 4366) \nshowed that elective neck dissection should be considered in patients with T2 tumors (AJCC 7th edition) ,\n399 due to the risk of occult nodal disease.404 \nPatients with cT1– 2, N0 disease who were observed had higher \nrecurrence rates than those who had elective neck dissection ( odds ratio \n[OR], 4.18; 95% CI , 2.78–6.28), though studies were heterogeneous.  \nA 2023 Cochrane review of 15 trials (n = 2583) evaluated surgical \ntreatments for N0 oral/oropharyngeal cancers .99 Five trials found that \nelective neck dissection improves OS versus  therapeutic dissection (HR , \n0.64;  95% CI , 0.50–0.83; moderate certainty). It also improved DFS and \nreduced locoregional recurrence. However,  elective neck dissection was \nassociated with more adverse events ( relative risk [ RR], 1.31;  95% CI , \n1.11– 1.54; moderate certainty).  The review also found no significant \ndifferences in OS, DFS, or recurrence between SLNB and elective \ndissection.  \nElective neck dissection in early -stage mucosal lip cancer remains \ncontroversial. Historically, it was reserved for T3 or T4 disease, prior to classification of mucosal lip as part of the oral cavity. While depth of \ninvasion is a known risk factor for nodal spread in lip cancer, this has not \nbeen specifically examined in mucosal lip tumors .\n405 Nonetheless, a depth \n>4 mm or T2 classification may justify elective dissection \n(supraomohyoid), with special attention to submental and perifacial nodes. \nSLNB may also be considered, as with other oral cavity sites.  \nSLNB can identify occult cervical metastases (see  Sentinel Lymph Node \nBiopsy  in NCCN Guidelines ).406- 412 While early -stage lip cancers rarely \nhave occult nodal disease, SLNB is feasible in patients at high risk based \non tumor size and depth .413-415 A systematic review of 98 studies showed \nsensitivity and specificity of 82.7% and 98.1%, respectively, for detecting \ncervical metastases in cT1– 2 N0 cancers .416 In a phase III multicenter \nRCT (n = 307), SLNB and elective neck dissection showed no significant PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Results from an ongoing NRG trial \n(NCT04333537) may provide additional clarity.  Although agents like \ntechnetium Tc99m tilmanocept have been evaluated for SLNB in oral \n419,420cancer s,419,420 the data are insufficient for the P anel to recommend a \nspecific agent.  \nPostsurgical adjuvant treatment depends on the presence of adverse pathologic features.  Positive or close margins and extranodal extension \n(ENE) are indications for systemic therapy with radiation.  Perineural, \nvascular, and lymphatic invasion are less established indications but \ntypically warrant adjuvant RT.  Patients with ENE with or without  positive \nmucosal margins should receive postoperative systemic therapy/RT (category 1). For close or positive margins, re -resection is preferred if \nfeasible; otherwise, RT or systemic therapy/RT may be considered.  \nSurgery is preferred for locally advanced disease. For resected advanced -\nstage cancers with ENE and/or positive mucosal margins, systemic \ntherapy/RT (category 1) is recommended.\n138- 141,143 Positive or close \nmargins may also be managed with re- resection if feasible, though this is \nmore complex following free flap reconstruction. EBRT should be \nconsidered; the role of brachytherapy remains underexplored (see  \nRadiation Therapy  below). For other high- risk features ( eg, pT3/4, pN2/3, \nlevel IV/V nodes, perineural, vascular, or lymphatic invasion), RT alone is \nrecommended, or systemic therapy/RT may be considered.  \nRadiation Therapy  \nFor definitive RT in T1– 2, N0 disease, doses to intermediate and low -risk \nsites range from 54 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to 63 Gy (1.6 Gy/fraction) (see \nPrinciples of Radiation Therapy  in NCCN Guidelines). Suspected subclinical disease sites may receive 54– 60 Gy in sequential IMRT, or 54–\n63 Gy in IMRT with dose painting, depending on fraction size (1.6– 1.8 \nGy). Doses of 66 –70 Gy are appropriate for high- risk disease.  \nRT may include EBRT with or without brachytherapy depending on tumor size. Brachytherapy should only be performed at experienced centers  and \nmay be appropriate in select cases ( eg, close/positive margins after \nresection and flap reconstruction). While supportive data are limited, \nNCCN provides guidance on both low - and high- dose rate \nbrachytherapy .\n421,422 \nFollow -up/Surveillance  \nSurveillance recommendations are provided in the algorithm (see Follow -\nup Recommendations  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers).  \nCancer of the Oropharynx  \nThe oropharynx includes the base of the tongue, tonsils, soft palate, and pharyngeal wall. The oropharynx is extremely rich in lymphatics. \nDepending on the subsite involved, 15% to 75% of patients present with \nlymph node involvement. Oropharyngeal cancer that is p16 -positive (ie, \nHPV-mediated) is a different disease than p16 -negative cancer. To take \ninto account these differences, separate staging criteria were published for \np16-negative and p16 -positive oropharyngeal cancer in the 8\nth edition of \nthe AJCC Cancer Staging Manual.400 In 2018, the Panel created separate \nalgorithms for p16 -positive (HPV -mediated) oropharyngeal cancer.

Accurate staging (see \nTable 3 for p16 -negative oropharyngeal cancer and Table 4 for p16-\npositive oropharyngeal cancer) depends on a complete H&N examination and appropriate imaging studies (see Cancer of the Oropharynx : Workup  \nin NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).\n400,423  \nThe Panel recommends examination under anesthesia (EUA) with biopsy \nconfirmation for patients presenting with a p16- positive cervical lymph \nnode prior to treatment decision- making. There may be situations in which \nthe EUA is undesirable or could be bypassed. These i nclude patients at \nhigh risk for general anesthesia and those who undergo a thorough \nexamination including tongue base palpation, or those who require \nsystemic therapy/RT and will not have their treatment plan affected, \nregardless of surgical evaluation. These situations remain the minority of \ncases.  \nTumor HPV testing by use of surrogate p16 immunohistochemistry  (IHC) \nis now required for cancers of the oropharynx because of the new AJCC \n8th edition staging system400 (see the following section on HPV Testing ). \nHPV Testing   \np16 expression correlates with HPV status in geographic regions where \nHPV is etiologically responsible for a high proportion of cancers.424,425 \nThere are currently no diagnostic tests with regulatory approval. The \nNCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers recommend evaluation of \ntumor HPV status by use of a surrogate of p16 IHC in all patients \ndiagnosed with an oropharyngeal cancer. Expression of  p16 as detected \nby IHC is a widely available surrogate biomarker that has very good \nagreement with  HPV status  as determined by HPV E6/E7 mRNA \nexpression.42,424 -427 Confirmatory HPV testing of tumor is recommended for \nclinical trials of HPV -targeted therapeutics or designed to test de -\nintensification strategies. Direct HPV confirmatory tests include \npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RNA or DNA in situ hybridization (ISH). The performance of various plasma cell -free HPV DNA detection \nassays (preferably validated per CLIA and CAP regulatory guidelines) for a diagnosis of HPV -positive oropharyngeal cancer against a gold standard \nof E6/E7 mRNA detection is unknown. Sens itivity and specificity against \np16-IHC are approximately 90% and 94%, respectively.\n428 At this time, \npersistent cell -free oncogenic HPV DNA detection in plasma (among those \npositive and quantifiable at diagnosis) may identify patients at increased \nrisk for progression after completion of curative intent therapy.429,430 \nHowever, without concurrent clinical, radiographic or pathological correlates represents an outcome without actionable therapeutic \nimplications outside of clinical trials.  \nAnalyses of HPV testing methods have shown that sensitivity and specificity of p16 IHC range from 94% to 97% and 83% to 84%, \nrespectively, with sensitivity and specificity of HPV16 ISH ranging from \n85% to 88% and 88% to 95%.\n42,427 The reduced specificity for p16 IHC \nmay be due to the presence of p16- positive tumors that do not have \nevidence of HPV DNA, while the reduced sensitivity for HPV16 ISH may \nbe due to the presence of other high- risk HPV types in the tumor. PCR \nmay provide additional sensitivity while ISH provides increased specificity.\n9,424,427,431,432 PCR may also increase false positive rates from \nspecimen contamination; for example, by a prevalent oral oncogenic \ninfection unrelated to the cancer in approximately 13% of U .S. men who \nsmoke. Sufficient pathologic material for HPV testing can be obtained by \nFNA.9,433 Institutions should evaluate concordance between p16 and direct \nHPV testing, as this may vary by regions, particularly if considering use of \np16 IHC alone as a surrogate.

Of \nnote, the following categories are treated as advanced cancer : T4b, any N; \nunresectable nodal disease; unfit for surgery; or M1 disease at initial \npresentation (see Very Advanced Head and Neck Cancer  in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Head and Neck Cancers ). \nA clinical staging system  for p16 -positive oropharyngeal cancer was \ndeveloped using data from 1907 patients with non -metastatic HPV -positive \noropharyngeal cancer from seven cancer centers in Europe and the United States.\n436 OS did not significantly differ between T4a and T4b \ndisease ( P = .41). Therefore, these were collapsed into one T4 category. \nFive-year OS rates did not significantly differ in patients with N1, N2a, or \nN2b disease, based on the AJCC 7th edition N classification,399 so the \nstudy investigators reasoned that these patients could be grouped into one \ncategory (ie, at least one ipsilateral metastatic node ≤6 cm).  \nAn analysis of 704 patients with resected p16- positive oropharyngeal \nsquamous cell carcinoma from five cancer centers showed that the N -\nclassification system for oropharyngeal cancer that was described in the \n7th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual399 was not significantly associated with OS.437 However, patients with four or fewer pathologically \nconfirmed metastatic nodes had a higher 5- year OS rate, compared to \npatients with five or more pathologically confirmed metastatic nodes (89% \nvs. 71%, respectively).  \nThe recommendations for p16 (HPV) -positive oropharyngeal cancer in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers accommodate the AJCC 8th \nedition staging system for p16 -positive oropharyngeal cancer.400 However, \ndifferences in recommendations between p16- negative disease and p16 -\npositive disease are relatively modest, since the staging system is based on prognostic models and is not based on prospective data from clinical \ntrials that guide clinical decision- making. Based on differences in features \nassociated with prognosis,\n436,437 the staging criteria for p16 -positive \noropharyngeal cancer differs from staging for p16 -negative oropharyngeal \ncancer in the following ways400: \n• T4b disease has been removed from the staging criteria for \ndefining the primary tumor.  \n• Criteria for defining nodal involvement (both clinical and pathologic) \nhave been simplified for p16- positive disease. Clinical N staging for \np16-positive oropharyngeal cancer is based on lymph node size \nand laterality, while pathologic N staging is based on number of \nlymph nodes. Further, pN3 disease has been removed for \npathologic N. \nThe treatment algorithms for p16 -positive disease have been divided by \nthe Panel into four staging categories:  \n1) cT1 –2, cN0 \n2) cT0 –2, cN1 (single node ≤3 cm)  \n3) cT0 –2, cN1 (single node >3 cm, or 2 or more ipsilateral nodes \n≤6 cm); or cT 0–2, cN2; or cT3, cN0– 2 \n4) cT0– 3, cN3 or cT4 , cN0-3 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-32 The algorithms for p16 (HPV) -positive oropharyngeal cancer in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Head and Neck Cancers incorporate the staging criteria \npresented in the 8th Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual400 based \non clinical staging criteria. This is to acknowledge that decision- making \ncontinues to be frequently based on data from  trials that included \noropharyngeal as well as other anatomic sites that were staged utilizing AJCC 7\nth edition nodal staging criteria.399 \nTreatment  \nExpert c onsensus is that HPV  status should be used as a stratification \nfactor or should be addressed in separate trials (HPV -related vs. -\nunrelated disease ) for which patients with oropharyngeal  cancer are \neligible.438-440 With some exceptions, which are noted in this section below, \nthe treatment algorithms for p16- negative and p16 -positive oropharyngeal \ncancer are identical. There is currently no evidence that the staging criteria \npublished in the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual400 should \ndrive clinical decision -making, as it is currently unknown how to \ntherapeutically address the vast biological differences between the two \ndistinct cancers. Panel members  urge that  patients with HPV -positive \ncancers  be enrolled in clinical trials evaluating biological and \ntreatment -related questions.441- 443 \nSome clinicians have suggested that less -intense treatment may be \nadequate for HPV -positive oropharyngeal cancers (ie, deintensification).48 \nWhile not considered deintensification, other RT- based strategies that may \nbe used to potentially minimize harm in patients with p16- positive \noropharyngeal cancer include use of image -guided RT and consideration \nof unilateral neck irradiation in disease t hat is well- lateralized.444 Available \ndata supporting these assertions are limited by retrospective analyses, \nsingle -institution phase 3 trials, variability in HPV testing method used, and \nshort follow -up periods.48,442,445,446 Deintensification treatment protocols for \nHPV-positive locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials. Strategies under active investigation \ninclude reducing or using biomarker or response -stratified RT dose  or \ntumor hypoxia, using RT alone versus chemoradiation, using less invasive surgical procedures such as transoral laser microsurgery or TORS, using \nsequential systemic therapy/RT, and using immunotherapy.\n442,444,447,448 \nEarly -stage (T1– 2, N0–1 for p16 -negative disease; T1– 2, N0 or single \nnode ≤3 cm for p16- positive disease)  oropharyngeal cancers may be \ntreated with  definitive RT or resection of the primary with neck \ndissection.116,119,449,450 Tumors at or approaching the midline (ie, tumors in \nthe base of the tongue, posterior pharyngeal wall, soft palate, and tonsil \ninvading the tongue base) are at risk of contralateral metastasis and \nwarrant bilateral treatment. A staged contralateral neck dissection can be \nperformed in order to avoid RT in patients with cT1– 2 p16- negative \noropharyngeal cancer if the primary tumors is near the midline and \nresected to adequate margins with no adverse pathologic features.  \nThe randomized phase II ORATOR trial aimed to compare swallow -related \nQOL outcomes in patients with early -stage T1– T2, N0 –2 oropharyngeal \ncancer treated with primary RT or systemic therapy/RT, versus those \ntreated with TORS with neck dissection with or without adjuvant RT or \nsystemic therapy/RT.451 The study enrolled 68 patients from six hospitals \nin Canada and Australia (88% p16- positive), and compared MDADI scores \nbetween the two groups at 1 year. Swallow -related QOL outcomes \nreached statistical significance favoring the primary RT cohort; however, this difference did not meet criteria for a clinically meaningful change and \nwith long -term follow- up, the difference in scores became less pronounced \nwith the passage of time.\n451,452 Study results showed that there were \nexcellent and similar PFS and OS rates in both arms. The authors \nconcluded that “RT-  and TORS -based approaches were associated with \nclinically similar QOL outcomes, but differing spectra of toxicities, and \ndifferences in QOL between arms decreased over time.

Study accrual was halted early due to unacceptable grade 5 \ntoxicities (two attributed to treatment) in the TORS arm. Results showed 2-\nyear PFS and OS of 100% in the primary RT arm compared with 86% and \n90%, respectively in the TORS arm, both significantly favoring primary \nRT.454 Additional randomized trials of minimally invasive transoral surgery \nor RT for oropharyngeal cancer are ongoing (NCT02984410, \nNCT05144100) . \nResults from multiple phase II trials show that RT deintensification is associated with promising PFS rates in patients with p16- positive \noropharyngeal cancer.\n455-459 A phase II randomized trial of low -risk HPV -\nassociated oropharyngeal cancer ( ≤10 pack years, T1– 2 N1 or T3 N0 –1) \ndemonstrated that de- escalated RT to 60 Gy with concurrent cisplatin was \nassociated with a 2 -year PFS rate of 90.5%, and accelerated RT alone to \n60 Gy was associated with a 2- year PFS rate of 87.6%.460 A follow up \nphase II/III trial comparing 70 Gy with cisplatin, 60 Gy with cisplatin, or 60 Gy with nivolumab was stopped after phase II for futility, with preliminary \nresults favoring 70 Gy with cisplatin, with a 2 -year PFS of 98.1%, \ncompared with 88.6% for 60 Gy with cisplatin, and 90.3% for 60 Gy with \nnivolumab.\n461 A prospective phase II feasibility trial of initial TORS followed \nby risk -adapted adjuvant treatment demonstrated a 2 -year PFS rate of \n96.9% for low -risk disease with TORS alone, 94.9% for intermediate -risk \ndisease with 50 Gy adjuvant RT, 96% for intermediate- risk disease with 60 Gy adjuvant RT, and 90.7% for high- risk disease with 66 Gy adjuvant RT \nwith concurrent weekly cisplatin.462 \nResearch on the impact of adverse pathologic features such as extranodal \nextension and number of involved nodes on outcomes in patients with \np16-positive disease who have undergone resection is rapidly evolving. \nAnalyses from the RTOG 9501139 and EORTC 22931 trials,138 prior to the \nera of p16/HPV testing, showed that extranodal extension is associated \nwith poor prognosis and demonstrated benefit to adjuvant systemic \ntherapy/RT in patients with locally advanced SCCHN who have undergone \nsurgical resection.140 Data suggesting equivalent outcomes of adjuvant RT \nand systemic therapy/RT for p16 -positive oropharyngeal cancer with \nextranodal extension are restricted to retrospective trials,45,438,463 -468 \nalthough clinical trials are being conducted to validate the revised AJCC staging\n400 for clinical decision -making. Secondary to lack of high- quality, \nprospective clinical evidence in the modern era, systemic therapy/RT is a \ncategory 2A option for both patients with p16 -positive disease and p16-\nnegative disease and extranodal extension. Ad juvant systemic therapy/RT \nremains a category 1 recommendation for patients with non -oropharyngeal \nSCCHN who have extranodal extension. Since patients with p16- positive \noropharyngeal cancer have a generally favorable prognosis and may live longer, toxicity  and QOL are concerns for these patients.\n442,443 On the \nother hand, they are also younger, with fewer comorbidities, so they can \nprobably tolerate combined adjuvant therapy better. Omitting systemic \ntherapy and administering radiotherapy alone is a category 2B option for \npatients with p16- positive cT0– 2, cN0 –1 disease (single node ≤3 cm) who \nhave extranodal extension following surgery. For patients with positive or close margins, re- resection (if feasible),  RT, and  systemic therapy /RT are \ntreatment options .\n156 For patients with other risk features  such as pT3 or \npT4 primary, one positive node >3 cm or multiple positive nodes, nodal \ndisease in levels IV or V, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, or lymphatic invasion , adjuvant treatment options include RT or systemic PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

If p16- negative disease that is pN1 following \nresection with no other adverse pathologic features present, RT may be \nconsidered.  \nBased on results from the phase III randomized GORTEC trial186 and \nretrospective analyses from the National Cancer Database (NCDB),469,470 \nsystemic therapy/RT is a treatment option for patients with p16- negative \nN1 disease. However, this is a category 2B option, since the number of \npatients with T1– T2, N1 disease enrolled in the GORTEC trial is small, \nand more data from prospective trials ar e needed. For patients with p16 -\npositive disease, systemic therapy/RT is also a category 2B option for T0–\nT2 disease and the involvement of a single node ≤3 cm.  \nFor locally advanced resectable disease (T3– 4a, N0–1, or N2– 3 for p16-\nnegative disease; T0– 2, cN1 [single node >3 cm, or 2 or more ipsilateral \nnodes ≤6 cm] or N2, or T3, N0– 3, or T4 for p16 -positive disease),  \ntreatment recommendations include concurrent systemic therapy /RT156,186 \nand resection of the primary and neck dissection  (with appropriate \nadjuvant therapy [systemic therapy/RT or RT]), in addition to enrollment in clinical trials. As with early -stage disease, tumors at or approaching the \nmidline should be strongly considered for bilateral treatment of the neck. \nThe Panel asserts that concurrent systemic therapy/RT is preferred in \npatients with locoregionally advanced HPV -positive disease who have \nclinical evidence of fixed or matted nodes or obvious extranodal extension \nin patients, as surgery is not recommended for these patients.  \nInduction chemotherapy (followed by RT or systemic therapy/RT, though \nsurgery may be an option in very select patients with disease that does not \nrespond to induction chemotherapy) is listed as a treatment option for \npatients with locally advanced resectable oropharyngeal cancer regardless \nof p16 status,\n116,119,471 but is a category 3 option due to lack of consensus \namong NCCN Member Institutions. Panel concerns are based on absence of benefit of induction chemotherapy in randomized clinical trials and concerns that use of better -tolerated —but potentially less effective—\nconcurrent regimens or poorer patient adherence with RT may compromise outcomes (see Induction Chemotherapy in this Discussion , \nand Cancer of the Oropharynx  in the NCCN Guidelines for  Head and Neck \nCancers ). Patients with p16 -positive cN2 –3 disease who are treated with \ninitial surgery have a high likelihood of extranodal extension, which warrants adjuvant systemic therapy/RT treatment. Triple modality \nmanagement is associated with increased toxicity. Beginning treatment \nwith concurrent systemic therapy /RT may help decrease the need for triple \nmodality therapy and additional treatment -induced morbidity.

The majority of clinical trials in this space have been single -arm phase 2 and need to be compared to the standard of care in \nrandomized trials.  \nFollow -up/Surveillance  \nRecommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see \nFollow -up Recommendations  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers).  \nCancer of the Hypopharynx \nThe hypopharynx  extends from the superior border of the hyoid bone to \nthe lower border of the cricoid cartilage and is essentially a muscular, lined \ntube extending from the oropharynx to the cervical esophagus. For staging \npurposes, the hypopharynx is divided into three areas: 1) the pyriform \nsinus (the most common site of cancer in the hypopharynx); 2) the \nposterior pharyngeal walls; and 3) the postcricoid area.  Workup and Staging  \nA multidisciplinary consultation is encouraged. Accurate staging (see \nTable 3) depends on a complete H&N examination coupled with \nappropriate studies (see Cancer of the Hypopharynx : Workup  in the \nNCCN Guidelines for  Head and Neck Cancers ).400 For patients with \ncancer of the hypopharynx, the prognosis can be poor despite aggressive \ncombined modality treatment.  \nTreatment   \nPatients with resectable disease are divided into two groups based on the \nindicated surgical options: 1) those with early -stage cancer who are \namenable to larynx -preserving (conservation) surgery (most T1, N0; \nselected T2, N0); and 2) those with advanced r esectable cancer who \nrequire pharyngectomy with total or partial laryngectomy (T1– 4a, any N). \nThe surgery and RT options for the former group (see Cancer of the \nHypopharynx  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers) \nrepresent a consensus among the P anel members.  \nPatients with T1– 3, any N disease, for whom the indicated surgical option \nis partial or total laryngopharyngectomy, may be managed with three \napproaches  (see Cancer of the Hypopharynx  in the NCCN Guidelines for \nHead and Neck Cancers) in addition to enrollment in clinical trials: 1) \ninduction chemotherapy followed by additional treatment, depending on \nthe response; 2) surgery with neck dissection(s), and postoperative RT or \nchemoradiati on as dictated by pathologic risk features; or 3) concurrent \nsystemic the rapy/RT. When using concurrent systemic therapy/RT, the \npreferred systemic agent is high- dose cisplatin (category 1) (see Principles \nof Systemic Therapy  for Non- Nasopharyngeal Cancers  in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-36 The option of the induction chemotherapy/ definitive  RT is based on an \nEORTC randomized trial.300 This trial enrolled 194 eligible patients with \nstage II –IV resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the pyriform sinus (152 \npatients) and aryepiglottic fold (42 patients), excluding patients with T1 or \nN2c disease. Patients were randomly assigned either to \nlaryngopharyngectomy and postoperative RT, or to systemic therapy with \ncisplatin and 5- FU for a maximum of three cycles, followed by definitive \nRT. In contrast to a similar approach used for laryngeal cancer, a complete response to induction chemotherapy was required before \nproceeding with definitive RT. The published results  showed equivalent \nsurvival, with median survival duration and a 3- year survival rate of 25 \nmonths and 43% (95% CI, 27% –59%), respectively, for the surgery group \nversus 44 months and 57% (95% CI, 42% –72%), respectively, for the \ninduction chemotherapy group.\n300 A functioning larynx was preserved in \n42% of patients who did not undergo surgery. Local or regional failure rates did not differ between the patients treated with surgery and patients \ntreated with chemotherapy , although the patients receiving chemotherapy \nshowed a significant reduction in distant metastases as a site of first \nfailure ( P = .041).  \nFor induction chemotherapy as part of a larynx preservation strategy, \ninclusion of only patients with the specified TNM stages is recommended. \nSuccess on larynx preservation with an induction chemotherapy strategy \nis best established for patients who had a  complete response to induction \ntherapy at the primary site and stable or improved disease in the neck. A randomized trial showed that an alternating regimen of cisplatin/5- FU with \nRT yielded larynx preservation, progression- free interval, and OS rates \nequivalent to those obtained with induction platinum/5 -FU followed by \nRT.\n476,477 However, a long- term update from this trial showed that larynx \npreservation rate was higher in patients who were randomized to receive \nthe alternating regimen (32%), compared to patients who received the \nsequential regimen (25%).477 Given available randomized data demonstrating the superiority of TPF compared with PF for induction chemoradiation, the triplet is now recommended as induction for this \napproach.\n312,313 \nAs noted in the algorithm, surgery is recommended if a partial response or \nless occurs after induction chemotherapy (see Cancer of the Hypopharynx  \nin the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). The nature of the operation will depend on the stage and extent of the tumor at presentation. \nPartial laryngeal surgery may still be considered, although most patients \nwill require total laryngectomy, and  at least a partial pharyngectomy. In \nthis situation, or when primary surgery is the selected management path,  \npostoperative systemic therapy/RT is recommended (category 1) for the \nadverse pathologic features of  extranodal extension and/or positive or \nclose  mucosal margin . For other risk features, clinical judgment should be \nused when deciding to use RT alone or when considering adding systemic \ntherapy to RT (see Cancer of the Hypopharynx  in the NCCN Guidelines \nfor Head and Neck Cancers). Severe late toxicity appears to be \nassociated with the amount of RT\n307 and treatment with radiosensitizing \nsystemic therapy.  \nOptions for patients with T4a, any N disease include: 1) total laryngopharyngectomy plus neck dissection(s) followed by adjuvant \nsystemic therapy/RT or RT; 2) enrollment in clinical trials; 3) induction \nchemotherapy (category 3); or 4) systemic therapy/RT (category 3) (see \nCancer of the Hypopharynx  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers, and Primary Systemic Therapy with Concurrent RT under Systemic Therapy  in the Discussion).  \nRadiation Therapy Fractionation  \nFractionation for RT is discussed in the algorithm (see Cancer of the \nHypopharynx : Principles of Radiation Therapy  in the NCCN Guidelines for  \nHead and Neck Cancers ).

These studies are \nimportant to determine the full extent of tumor to assign stage \nappropriately and to design radiation treatment volumes that will \nencompass all the disease with appropriate doses. Multidisciplinary \nconsultation is encouraged. The 2017 AJCC staging classification (8\nth edition) is used as the basis for treatment recommendations (see Table \n2).400 \nEpstein- Barr virus (EBV)  DNA testing of plasma may also be considered \n(see Epstein- Barr Virus , below)  although it has only prognostic, not \npredictive, value at present.  HPV infection has been associated with NPC \nin case reports and very small case series, but the limited data regarding \nits impact on chemoradiation outcomes are conflicting.484- 486 In most of \nthese reports, HPV -associated NPC appear to have better local control \nand survival prognosis than NPC that are neither EBV nor HPV associated \n(“double negative”). Therefore, while routine testing for HPV in NPC is not \nrecommended by the NCCN Panel , it is recognized that the absence of \nHPV or EBV association is a highly negative prognostic factor.  \nEpstein -Barr Virus  \nInfection with EBV is an etiologic factor in the development of NPC.480,481 \nWorkup for NPC may include EBV testing of the tumor itself and,  in some \ncases, plasma EBV DNA , particularly in the presence of nonkeratinizing \nand undifferentiated histology.487- 489 Testing methods for detection of EBV \nin tumor include ISH for EBV -encoded RNA (EBER)490 and IHC staining \nfor LMP1.491 ISH for EBER tends to be a more sensitive testing method for  \ncarcinomas, relative to LMP1 IHC staining.492 Real-time PCR may be used \nto evaluate EBV DNA titers  in serum or plasma.493 Sensitivity and \nspecificity values range from 53% to 96%, and 88% to 100%, respectively.\n494 Levels of plasma EBV DNA ha ve been shown to be \nindependently prognostic at baseline and following definitive chemoradiation. After induction chemotherapy, and after radiation, plasma \nEBV DNA levels are used in some centers as a means of outcome \nprognostication and residual disease monitoring.\n495-498 It should be noted \nas an important caveat that lack of harmonization of plasma EBV DNA \nassays has hampered development of consensus recommendations and \nincorporation into prognostic models.493 For patients  with locoregionally PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Most of these studies have been based on real -time PCR \nassays amplifying the  BamHI -W fragment.  \nTreatment  \nThe most recent clinical trial data on the treatment of NPC are limited to \nEBV- associated disease. Prospective studies that include patients with \nEBV- negative disease are largely lacking, or are only represented as non -\nprospectively defined subsets, primar ily in studies conducted in the United \nStates before the routine use of EBV testing for eligibility and monitoring in NPC clinical trials .\n511 \nEarly -Stage and Locoregionally Advanced Disease \nThe Intergroup trial 0099, which randomly assigned patients to EBRT  with \nconcurrent cisplatin plus adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5 -\nfluorouracil (PF) for three cycles versus EBRT alone (patients not \nseparated by EBV status) , closed early when an interim analysis disclosed \na highly significant survival advantage favoring the combined \nchemotherapy and radiation group.328 The addition of chemotherapy also decreased local, regional, and distant recurrence rates. This study was conducted in the United States, and s ubsequent phase 3 randomized trials \nin Asia confirmed that concurrent chemoradiation without adjuvant PF \nsimilarly  increased survival in endemic -area populations when compared \nwith RT alone.\n512- 515 In one of these trials, 5 -year OS was 70% for the \nchemoradiation group versus 59% for the RT group.512 A randomized \nstudy conducted in Singapore, which was modeled after the Intergroup 0099 treatment regimen, confirmed  the benefit of adding concurrent \nplatinum to RT  with adjuvant PF, using a multiday infusion of platinum \ninstead of a single bolus high- dose approach.\n514 One of the largest phase \n3 randomized trial s ever conducted in NPC  comparing concurrent \ncisplatin/RT with (or without) adjuvant PF  showed that adjuvant \nchemotherapy did not significantly improve survival following chemoradiation (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.49– 1.10; P = .13).\n516 \nAdvanced radiation techniques are recommended for curative- intent  \ntreatment of NPC and to minimize the long- term side effects that are \ncommon in survivors. IMRT is now preferred due to its ability to \nencompass all areas of cancer spread, which can be located in close \nproximity to the brainstem, temporal lobes, cochleae, and optic nerves  and \nchiasm. Randomized trials evaluating the optimal use of concurrent systemic therapy/RT for locoregionally advanced NPC were largely \ncompleted prior to the routine practi ce of IMRT, under earlier -era staging \nsystems.  Meta -analyses published in 2017 and 2018 showed that the \naddition of chemotherapy to IMRT did not improve survival outcomes in \nstage II disease (ie, T0– 2, N1 and T2, N0), compared to IMRT alone.\n517- 519 \nA multicenter randomized phase 2 trial from China also showed that the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to IMRT did not significantly improve \nsurvival outcomes or disease control in patients with stage II NPC (N = \n84).\n520 The combined treatment was also associated with increased \nincidence of leukopenia ( P = .022).

However, \ndifferences between the included studies assessing chemoradiation with \nand wit hout adjuvant chemotherapy (eg, different length of follow -up, \nfewer patients with stage II disease in trials assessing adjuvant \nchemotherapy) limited  the ability to make a firm conclusion regarding the \nefficacy of one treatment modality over the other. The NRG -HN001 trial \n(NCT02135042) , a phase 2/3 study, aimed to investigate whether delivery \nof adjuvant chemotherapy should be  eliminated or intensified based on the \nstatus of EBV DNA plasma levels  after chemoradiation.  This trial was \nclosed slightly prematurely due to slowing accrual; as of March 2024, \ninsufficient events had occurred to evaluate the value of the post radiation \nserum EBV DNA level as a biomarker for adjuvant treatment decision-\nmaking.  \nThere is substantial evidence supporting the use of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent systemic therapy/RT for treatment \nof locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer. Two randomized \nphase 3 trials from China published in 2019 show a survival  benefit for \ninduction chemotherapy followed by concurrent systemic therapy/RT, compared to concurrent systemic therapy/RT alone.\n523,524 Results from \nmultiple systematic reviews  suggest that induction chemotherapy prior to \nsystemic therapy/RT in patients with locally advanced NPC may potentially \nimpact tumor control, compared to systemic therapy/RT without additional \nchemotherapy .525- 528 However, these reviews had inconsistent results \nwhen evaluating the impact on survival. Based on comparisons with \nsystemic therapy/RT alone, induction chemotherapy appears to perform \nbetter than adjuvant chemotherapy for some outcomes, such as in \nreduction of distant metastases .529 \nCurrently available evidence generally  favor s the addition of induction \nchemotherapy to concurrent systemic therapy/RT in patients with \nlocoregionally advanced NPC  defined as T stage T3 or greater or N stage \nN2 or greater .525- 528,530 A 2017 network meta -analysis based on an  \nindividual patient data meta- analysis (including 20 trials and 5144 patients) \nshowed that the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to chemoradiation was \nassociated with better PFS  (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66– 0.98), compared to \nchemoradiation only.525 The authors  argued that more chemotherapy, in \naddition to concurrent chemoradiation , could reduce recurrence rates. A \n2023 update to this meta -analysis , which included 28 trials and 8214 \npatients , continued to show that both induction chemotherapy and \nadjuvant chemotherapy were superior to systemic therapy/RT alone, but induction chemotherapy was associated with greater benefit for distant \nprogression (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47– 0.93 and HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 –\n0.80 for induction chemotherapy with and without t axanes, respectively).\n530 \nA 2017 meta -analysis including 27 trials with 7940 patients showed that \ninduction chemotherapy prior to systemic therapy/IMRT ranked best for \nOS, PFS, and distant failure- free survival, although head- to-head \ncomparisons with other treatment sequences (10 evaluated, including systemic therapy/RT, induction chemotherapy prior to systemic \ntherapy/RT, and system ic therapy/RT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, \nall with IMRT or 2D/3D RT) were not performed .\n531 A randomized phase 3 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-40 trial from the Hong Kong Nasopharyngeal Cancer Study Group showed a \nsurvival benefit when comparing i nduction chemotherapy prior to systemic \ntherapy/RT to systemic therapy/RT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin/5 -FU), regardless of the induction regimen used (either PF or \ncisplatin/capecitabine).\n532 The induction chemotherapy sequence was also \nassociated with better distant control, compared to the adjuvant \nchemotherapy arm. However, this study was underpowered, due to the \nsmall number of patients in each study arm. Based upon the aggregate \ndata, the  NCCN Guidelines support the use of induction over adjuvant \nchemotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. A \nrandomized noninferiority phase 3 trial including 383 patients with \nlocoregionally advanced NPC showed that, following induction using three \ncycles of dose -modified TPF (docetaxel 60 mg/m2, cisplatin 60 mg/m2, 5-\nFU 3000 mg/m2), RT without low -dose concomitant cisplatin (30 \nmg/m2/week) was noninferior to RT with concomitant cisplatin for 3- year \nPFS (76.2% vs . 76.8%, respectively; HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.65– 1.32; P = \n.66).533 Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported more frequently in the \npatients who received RT with concomitant cisplatin (73%), compared to \npatients who received RT alone (54%). The challenge of this study is that \ndose- modified TPF is less widely used than ge mcitabine plus \ncisplatin(GC) as induction, and the doses of concurrent weekly cisplatin used were lower than the standard, which is 40 mg/m\n2/week or 100 mg/m2 \nevery 21 days. Therefore, these data have not changed recommendations \nconcerning the use of concurrent cisplatin following induction \nchemotherapy in this setting.  \nThree trials have reported on the adjuvant use of capecitabine following \nstandard chemoradiation of locoregionally advanced NPC, with \nimprovements in survival outcomes reported .534- 536 The vast majority of \npatients treated on the low dose metronomic adjuvant capecitabine study \nhad received both induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiation, supporting this adjuvant approach even in patients \nheavily pretreated with sequential chemoradiation.536 \nIn summary, currently available evidence favor s either  the addition of \ninduction or adjuvant chemotherapy  to concurrent systemic therapy/RT, \ncompared to systemic therapy/RT alone,  in patients with locoregionally \nadvanced NPC . Evidence suggests that induction chemotherapy may be \nassociated with a greater benefit for distant progression, and this is the \npreferred approach in the NCCN Guidelines for locally advanced NPC. \nThe routine use of adjuvant capecitabine following either induction and \nchemoradiation or chemoradiation alone is less established. Due to \nconcerns about escalating toxicity, ongoing investigations continue with \nthe goal of more precisely delineating which classes of NPC patients may \nbe safely offered lesser -intensity regimens.  \nWhile there have been several trials studying the addition of immune \ncheckpoint inhibitors to sequential chemoradiation in patients with \nlocoregionally advanced NPC, none of these trials have yet to \ndemonstrate an overall survival advantage .537,538 Therefore, it is premature \nto consider the addition of checkpoint inhibitor therapy for these patients.  \nNCCN Recommendations  \nPatients with an unknown primary site after appropriate workup but \nharboring cervical lymph nodal squamous cell carcinoma that is EBV -\npositive may be treated in the same manner as locoregionally advanced NPC. For other EBV -associated NPC, the principles of  treatment can \nmostly be outlined according to stage. Patients with T1, N0, M0 \nnasopharyngeal tumors should be treated with definitive RT alone.  Since \nT2, N0 disease is less likely to progress to distant metastasis compared to T2, N1 disease, definitive RT alone could be used; concurrent systemic \ntherapy may be indicated in the presence of high -risk features such as \nbulky tumor volume or high serum EBV DNA copy number .\n539,540 Induction \nchemotherapy followed by systemic therapy/RT is preferred for advanced PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

The use of capecitabine as adjuvant treatment following \ninduction and concurrent chemor adiation is supported by current \nevidence.536 Concurrent systemic therapy/RT alone is recommended for \npatients with T0– 2, N1 disease and can be considered for select patients \nwith lower risk T3, N0 disease, who were excluded from randomized trials evaluating the benefits of adjuvant and induction \nchemotherapy .\n516,523,524,541 Induction or adjuvant chemotherapy may be \nconsidered for these patients in the presence of high- risk features, \nincluding, for example, a high blood EBV DNA level, which may indicate \nworse prognosis. The recommended use of blood EBV DNA levels is \ncomplicat ed by lack of standardization and harmonization of these assays, \nso the NCCN Panel is unable to recommend specific quantitative guidance concerning their interpretation. For NPC that is not virally driven, similar \nprinciples are applied, although it may be a consideration that these \ntumors are generally more prone to local relapse and have lower rates of distant metastases.  \nWhen induction chemotherapy is used, gemcitabine/cisplatin\n524,542 and \nmodified TPF541 are both preferred options for patients with EBV -related \nNPC. Other induction/sequential chemotherapy regimens are included in \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers based on lower -level \nevidence. The use of induction for patients with non– EBV- related NPC \nremains  undefined, as all trials studying induction in NPC were in EBV -\nrelated NPC patient populations. When using induction chemotherapy for non– EBV- related NPC, it may be equally reasonable to use regimens \nestablished in other non –EBV- related SCC HN sites, such as TPF.  \nThe Panel recommends concurrent systemic therapy/RT  (cisplatin) with  \neither induction or  adjuvant chemotherapy for locoregionally advanced NPC, favoring induction over adjuvant in the clinical scenarios discussed \nabove. Concurrent cisplatin with RT is recommended for all patients who \ndo not have a contraindication to the drug,  because the vast majority of \nrandomized trials support the use of cisplatin in this setting.\n328,512 If using \nadjuvant chemotherapy, the preferred option remains cisplatin/5- FU. Use \nof metronomic capecitabine as an adjuvant chemotherapy option for \ntreatment of stage III– IVa disease (excluding T3– 4, N0 and T3, N1) is \nsupported by two randomized phase 3 trials (discussed above). The subst itution of carboplatin or other platinum substitutes for cisplatin in \ninduction, concurrent, and adjuvant regimens, while studied to some extent ,\n543- 545 should be limited to patients who are cisplatin -ineligible.  \nMetastatic Disease  \nPopulation- based data appear to support the role of earlier RT in the \nmanagement of metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer ,546 but treatment \nultimately depends on whether the disease is localized or widespread and \nif it is symptomatic or posing a clinical risk to the patient .328,512,543 For \npatients with oligometastatic disease, potentially curative therapy (ie, RT \nalone or surgery) is indicated if the patient is fit (ECOG 0– 1); this \nlocoregionally -focused approach is often used following robust anti -tumor \neffects observed with systemic chemotherapy .547,548  \nIn a multicenter randomized phase 3 trial, patients (N = 126) with de novo \nmetastatic nasopharyngeal cancer who achieved a complete response or \npartial response after the first 3 cycles of cisplatin/5- FU and with good PS \nwere randomized to receive or not r eceive consolidative locoregional \nIMRT directed at the primary and nodal gross disease to total doses of 70 \nGy after completion of 6 planned cycles .549 The IMRT arm was associated \nwith improved 24 -month OS (76.4% vs . 54.5%) and PFS compared to \nchemotherapy alone.

However, \nit should be noted that the role of consolidative radiation has yet to be \ncompletely established in the current era where immunochemotherapy has \nnow become the recommended initial treatment in the first -line metastatic \nsetting.  \nIn a randomized phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nmaintenance capecitabine following induction chemotherapy in 104 \npatients with newly diagnosed metastatic NPC, median PFS was greater \nin patients who received maintenance capecitabine, com pared to patients \nwho received best supportive care alone (35.9 months vs . 8.2 months, \nrespectively).535 Objective response rate (25.0% vs . 11.5%, respectively) \nand median duration of response (40.0 months vs . 13.2 months, \nrespectively) both favored the maintenance capecitabine arm as well, \ncompared to best supportive care alone. Based on study results, \nmaintenance capecitabine without concurrent RT following induction \nchemotherapy is an option for patients wit h M1 oligometastatic disease \n(PS 0 –1 only).  \nGemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC)  is recommended for first- line therapy for \npatients with metastatic NPC based on category 1 level evidence \ndemonstrating a survival advantage over PF.550,551 See discussion of \nimmunotherapy below.  Because the data for GC demonstrating superiority \nto PF comes from an era when GC was not typically used for induction, \nthe superiority of GC over PF in patients who have had prior exposure to \nGC is unknown. Other combination regimens for these patients include cisplatin or carboplatin, plus a taxane\n552,553; cisplatin/5 -FU553,554; \ngemcitabine/carboplatin555; or carboplatin/cetuximab.555 Results from a \ncomparison of five different cisplatin- based regimens for NPC showed that \nall had substantial anti -cancer activity .556 Active and more commonly used \nsingle agents are listed in the algorithm (see Systemic Therapy for Nasopharyngeal Cancers  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers ).554,557 -568 \nToripalimab -tpzi, in combination with GC, is a category 1 preferred option \nin the NCCN Guidelines for first -line treatment of recurrent or metastatic \nNPC. Toripalimab, in combination with GC, was evaluated as a first -line \ntherapy option for recurrent or me tastatic NPC in the randomized phase \n3 JUPITER -02 trial .569 Patients from China, Taiwan, and Singapore (N = \n289) were randomized to receive toripalimab or a placebo. PFS (HR, \n0.52) and OS (HR, 0.63) were both significantly greater in the toripalimab \narm (median PFS , 21.4 months, median OS not reached) compared to \nthe placebo arm (median PFS , 8.2 months, median OS , 33.7 months). \nAdverse events leading to discontinuation of toripalimab or placebo, \nimmune -related adverse events, and grade 3 or greater immune- related \nadverse events were more frequently reported in the toripalimab arm, \nalthough overall incidence of adverse events, grade 3 or greater adverse \nevents, and fatal adverse events did not significantly differ between the \ntwo study arms. In addition, toripalimab monotherapy for recurrent or \nmetastatic NPC previously treated with chemotherapy is supported by a \nnonrandomized phase 2 study from China (N = 190), showing an overall \nresponse rate (ORR) of 20.5%, median DOR 12.8 months, median PFS \n1.9 months, and median OS 17.4 months.570 Toripalimab -tpzi is therefore \na preferred option in the NCCN Guidelines for recurrent or metastatic NPC, for disease progression on or after platinum -containing therapy.  \nTislelizumab, in combination with GC, was evaluated as a first -line \ntherapy option for recurrent or metastatic NPC in the randomized phase \n3 RATIONALE -309 trial .\n537 Patients from China (N = 263) were \nrandomized to receive tislelizumab or a placebo.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-43 patients with nonkeratinizing NPC that progressed following prior \nsystemic therapy treatment showed an ORR of 43% (95% CI, 21.8 %–\n66.0%), a disease control rate of 86% (95% CI, 63.7% –97.0%), median \nduration of response of 8.3 months, and median PFS of 10.4 months .571 \nBased on the results of these trials, tislelizumab -jsgr is a category 2B \ntreatment option in the first -line (in combination with GC) and subsequent \nline settings for patients with recurrent or metastatic NPC. This drug is \ncurrently not FDA approved for tr eatment of NPC. \nThe anti -programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1) antibody camrelizumab, \nadministered in combination with GC, has also been evaluated in a \nrandomized phase 3 trial from China, which a prespecified interim \nanalysis showed significantly greater PFS in the camr elizumab arm, \ncompared to the placebo arm (9.7 months vs . 6.9 months, respectively; \nHR, 0.54 ).572 This agent is not currently available in the United States.  \nThe anti -PD-1 antibodies  pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been \nindependently evaluated as monotherapy for previously treated, \nrecurrent or metastatic NPC in nonrandomized trials. Pembrolizumab in \npatients with PD -L1–positive recurrent or metastatic NPC was assessed \nin the nonrandomized multi -institutional phase 1B KEYNOTE- 028 trial ( N \n= 27).573 All but two of the patients had previously received systemic \ntherapy for their recurrent or metastatic disease. The objective response \nrate (partial response only, since  no patients had a complete response) \nwas 26%, with a median duration of response of 17.1 months. The OS rate at 6 and 12  months was 85%  and 63%, respectively, with PFS rates \nof 39% and 34%, respectively. Approximately  30% of patients \nexperienced a grade 3– 5 drug -related adverse event. Pembrolizumab is \nan option  for patients with previously  treated PD -L1–positive recurrent or \nmetastatic NPC, but this is category 2B based on Panel consensus.  \nPembrolizumab is also an option for patients with previously treated tumor mutational burden -high (TMB -H; ≥10 mut/Mb) disease, based on results from the phase 2 KEYNOTE -158 trial, although there were no \npatients with nasopharyngeal cancer in this study .\n574 \nNivolumab as treatment for recurrent or metastatic NPC has been \nevaluated in phase 1/2 trials. In the CheckMate 358 trial, nivolumab had \nan ORR of 20.8% and a disease control rate of 45.8% in 24 patients .575 A \nJapanese study showed a more modest ORR of 16.7% and DCR of 41.7%.\n576 In an NCI sponsored trial, 44 patients with previously treated \nrecurrent or metastatic NPC (>80% non -keratinizing disease) were treated \nwith nivolumab.577 The ORR was 20.5%, 1- year OS was 59%, and 1 -year \nPFS was 19.3%. Based on the results of these trials, nivolumab is a \ncategory 2B treatment option for patients with previously treated, recurrent \nor metastatic non- keratinizing NPC.  \nRadiation Therapy Fractionation  \nRadiation dose- fractionation schedules may vary slightly depending on \ninstitutional preference (see Cancer of the Nas opharynx : Principles of \nRadiation Therapy  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers) . \nRadiation doses of approximately 70  Gy given in  standard fractions  of \napproximately 2.0 Gy/fraction are recommended for control of the gross \nprimary tumor and involved lymph nodes ; one specific alternative schedule \nconsists of 2.12 Gy/fraction daily (Monday –Friday)  for 33 fractions to all \nareas of gross disease, also to a total dose of approximately 69.69 Gy .578 \nLow-risk subclinical disease , such as in the low neck, can be treated \nseparately to a dose of  44–50 Gy at 2.0 Gy/fraction or can be treated \nsimultaneously within the same plan as for gross disease to doses of 5 4–\n56 Gy at 1.6 –1.7 Gy/fraction . For areas considered to be at intermediate \nrisk, slightly higher doses such as 59.4– 63 Gy in 1.8– 2.0 Gy/fraction can \nbe given to regions of the skull base and neck  in proximity to gross \ndisease.  The total doses and fractionation should be prescribed in \nrelationship to each other and the overall schedule as part of an integrated \nplan to address the varying areas at risk.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-44 Some recent initiatives have attempted to reduce treatment volumes. For \ninstance, in a randomized multi -center phase 3 trial from China (N = 446), \nfive-year regional relapse- free survival did not significantly differ between \npatients with N0 -1 NPC who rece ived elective RT to the ipsilateral upper \nneck (sparing the uninvolved lower neck) and patients who received standard whole- neck irradiation (95.0% vs. 94.9%, respectively ).\n579 Acute \nradiation- related toxic effects were generally similar between the study \narms, though rates of some late toxicities favored the elective upper -neck \nRT arm, specifically hypothyroidism, skin toxicity, dysphagia, and neck tissue damage.\n579,580 \nDefinitive -style dose -fractionation schedules are frequently used for \npatients with de novo metastatic disease who achieve response to initial \ninduction therapy and then become eligible for consolidative irradiation of \nthe gross primary and nodal disease. However, for other metastatic \nscenarios, a variety of palliative schedules may be used (see the NCCN \nGuidelines for Head and Neck Cancers  for these schedules). For \ntreatment volumes following induction chemotherapy, there are conflicting \nrecommendations ,581 but a common practice is to reduce the volumes \nreceiving the highest dose according to shrinkage of tumor that respects anatomic boundaries.  \nReirradiation of locoregionally recurrent NPC should be conducted with careful attention to the previously delivered radiation plan and performed \nwhen complete surgical extirpation is not possible.\n582 Because of the \nanatomic location of NPC in proximity to the optic structures, brain, brainstem, and spinal cord, there can be high risk with reirradiation of \ninjury to critical neural structures. In a phase 3 open label trial from China, \npatients with loc ally advanced recurrent NPC (N = 144) were randomized \nto receive hyperfractionated RT (prescription dose of approximately 64.8 Gy in 54 fractions, twice daily with an intrafraction interval of at least 6 \nhours) or RT with mild hypofractionation (prescripti on dose of 60 Gy in 27 fractions at 2.22 Gy/fraction, given once per day ).\n583 Both arms delivered \n54 Gy to an expanded target (1 Gy twice daily in the hyperfractionation arm, and 2 Gy once daily in the mild hypofractionation  arm). Three- year \nOS rates were improved in the hyperfractionation arm compared to the mild hypofractionation arm (74.6% vs. 55.0%, respectively; HR, 0.54; 95% \nCI, 0.33 –0.88; P = .014). While there was no significant difference in \nlocoregional relapse- free survival or distant metastasis -free survival, \nGrade 5 late complications were less frequent in the hyperfrac tionation \narm (7% vs . 24%). As tolerability and late complications are a frequent \nconcern associated with reirradiation, hyperfractionation to a lower total \nphysical dose has high appeal as an attractive option for patients who are \nable to manage this rigorous twice- daily schedule.  \nRecommendations regarding NPC reirradiation have been published,\n584 \nand reports describe a variety of technical approaches including IMRT, \nSBRT, and brachytherapy .585- 587 In general, a fractionated course of IMRT \nin combination with concurrent chemotherapy is the most frequently used \napproach when the intent remains curative, with SBRT or more highly \nhypofractionated schedules (eg, ≥3 Gy/fraction) being more commonly \nused in cases of palliative intent.  \nFollow -up/Surveillance  \nRecommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see Follow -up Recommendations  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancer s). Since the deep areas of the skull base are inaccessible to \nclinical examination, periodic cross -sectional imaging may be necessary.  \nLikewise, inspection of the nasopharyngeal mucosa may be best accomplished with periodic endoscopy. The clinical benefit of plasma EBV \nDNA monitoring is not yet clearly defined (see Epstein -Barr Virus , above), \nbut it may be considered in centers with experience (category 2B).

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-45 Cancer of the Larynx  \nThe larynx is divided into three regions: supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis. \nThe distribution of cancers is as follows: 30% to 35% in the supraglottic \nregion, 60% to 65% in the glottic region, and 5% in the subglottic region. The incidence and pattern of metastatic spread to regional nodes vary with \nthe primary region. The lymphatic drainage of the glottis is spars e and \nearly -stage primaries rarely spread to regional nodes. Because \nhoarseness is an early symptom, most glottic cancers are early stage at \ndiagnosis. Thus, glottic cancer has an excellent cure rate of 80% to 90%. \nNodal involvement adversely affects survi val rates and is rare in T1– 2 \ndisease. In contrast, > 50% of patients with supraglottic primaries present \nwith spread to regional nodes because of an abundant lymphatic network \nthat crosses the midline. Bilateral cervical metastases are not uncommon \nwith early -stage supraglottic primaries. Thus, supraglottic cancer is often \nmetastatic and higher stage at diagnosis. Subglottic cancer is not \ndiscussed, because it is  uncommon.  \nWorkup and Staging  \nThe evaluation of the patient to determine tumor stage is similar for glottic and supraglottic primaries  (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx  and Cancer of \nthe Supraglottic Larynx  in the  NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancer s). Multidisciplinary consultation is frequently indicated for both \nsites because of the potential impact on voice quality, speech, and \nswallowing functions (see Principles of Nutrition: Management and \nSupportive Care in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). \nThe 2017 AJCC stagi ng classification (8\nth edition) for laryngeal primary \ntumors is determined by the number of subsites involved, vocal cord \nmobility, the presence of metastases, extranodal extension, and invasion \nof thyroid/cricoid cartilage (see Table 5).400 Treatment  \nIn the NCCN Guidelines, the treatment of patients with laryngeal cancer is \ndivided into two categories: 1) tumors of the glottic larynx; or 2) tumors of \nthe supraglottic larynx.  \nFor patients with carcinoma in situ of the larynx, recommended treatment \noptions include: 1) endoscopic resection, which is preferred; or 2) RT.588,589 \nFor early -stage glottic or supraglottic cancer, a systematic review \npublished in 2009 showed that surgery or RT have similar effectiveness590 \n(see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx  and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx  in \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancer s), although the quality of \nstudies comparing the effectiveness of RT and surgery in early laryngeal \ncancer is low.591 A systematic review including 48 studies of patients with \nT2 glottic cancer specifically showed no difference in 5- year local control \nbetween transoral surgery (1156 patients; 77.3%) and EBRT (3191 \npatients; 75.8%).592 However, a meta -analysis including 11 studies \nshowed that OS ( P = .04) and laryngeal preservation ( P < .001) were both \nbetter in patients who were treated with transoral laser microsurgery, \ncompared to patients treated with RT.593 The choice of treatment modality \ndepends on anticipated functional outcome, the patient’s wishes, reliability \nof follow -up, and general medical condition.594 In patients with significant \npulmonary comorbidity, total laryngectomy may be preferable over endoscopic or open partial laryngectomy. Partial laryngeal surgery should \nbe carefully considered if adjuvant RT is likely. Consideration should be \ngiven to any suspicious lymphadenopathy and risk of metastatic nodal \ndisease. Neck dissection should be performed as indicated when the \nprimary site is treated surgically. In patients with T1–2 node- negative \ncancer of the supraglottic larynx, lymph node dissection is a ssociated with \ngreater OS.\n595 T1–2 supraglottic cancers have a significant risk of occult \nnodal disease at presentation.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-46 Postoperative adjuvant treatment depends on the presence or absence of \nadverse pathologic features, such as margin status, nodal staging, and \nany extranodal extension. For cancer of the glottic larynx, subglottic \nextension is also considered an adverse pat hologic feature. In the event of \nclose or positive margins in organ preservation surgery, re- resection to \nnegative margins may be considered. This may or may not require a total \nlaryngectomy to achieve.  \nResectable, advanced- stage glottic and supraglottic primaries are usually \nmanaged with a combined modality approach (see Cancer of the Glottic \nLarynx  and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx  in the  NCCN Guidelines for \nHead and Neck Cancer s). If laryngeal preservation is desired, concurrent \nsystemic therapy/RT is recommended, based on results from Intergroup \ntrial RTOG 91 -11.298,304 R91-11 was a successor trial to the VA trial and \ncompared three non- surgical regimens: 1) induction cisplatin/5- FU \nfollowed by RT (control arm and identical to that in the VA trial); 2) \nconcurrent RT and high- dose cisplatin 100 mg/m2 days 1, 22, and 43; and \n3) RT alone. RT was uniform in all three arms (70 Gy/7 weeks, 2 \nGy/fraction), as was the option of surgery (including total laryngectomy) for \nrelapsed/refractory disease in all arms. Patients with stage III and IV (M0) \ndisease were eligible, excluding T1 primaries and high- volume T4 \nprimaries (tumor extending >1 cm into the base of the tongue or tumor penetrating through cartilage). The key findings of the R91- 11 trial were: 1) \na statistically significant higher 2- year laryngeal preservation (local contr ol) \nrate of 88% for concurrent RT with cisplatin, compared to 74% for \ninduction chemotherapy and 69% for RT alone; 2) no significant difference \nin laryngeal preservation between induction and RT alone treatments; and \n3) similar survival for all treatment groups. Based on these results, \nconcurrent RT and systemic therapy (cisplatin preferred [category 1]) is a \ntreatment option for achieving laryngeal preservation for T3, any N glottic \nand supraglottic cancers.\n304 Long- term follow -up (10 years) of R91 -11 \nindicates that laryngeal preservation continues to be better (ie, statistically different) with concurrent cisplatin/RT when compared with either induction \nchemotherapy or RT alone.298 OS was not statistically different for all \ntreatment groups; there was more non– cancer -related mortality among \npatients treated with concurrent cisplatin/RT.  \nDefinitive RT (without systemic therapy ) is an option for patients with T3, \nN0–1 disease who are medically unfit or refuse systemic therapy (see \nCancer of the Glottic Larynx  and Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx  in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancer s). Surgery is also an option \nfor this patient population. For those patients whose disease persists after \nsystemic therapy/RT or RT, surgical therapy is indicated (see Pos t \nSystemic Therapy/RT or RT Neck Evaluation in Follow- up \nRecommendations  in the N CCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancer s).  \nInduction chemotherapy with management based on response is an option \nfor all but T1– 2, N0 glottic and supraglottic cancers. Based on the long -\nterm update of RTOG 91 -11, induction chemotherapy is an option for \npatients who require (are amenable to) total laryngectomy.298 After a \ncomplete or partial response with induction chemotherapy for patients with laryngeal cancer, RT alone is recommended (category 1)\n298; systemic \ntherapy/RT is a category 2B recommendation after a partial \nresponse312,313,596 (see Cancer of the Glottic Larynx  and Cancer of the \nSupraglottic Larynx  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).  \nFor patients with glottic and supraglottic T4a tumors, the recommended treatment approach is total laryngectomy with possible hemi - or total \nthyroidectomy and appropriate neck dissection(s) followed by adjuvant \ntreatment (RT or systemic therapy/RT)\n597 (see Cancer of the Glottic \nLarynx , Cancer of the Supraglottic Larynx , and Principles of Surgery  in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancer s). For selected patients with \nT4a tumors who decline surgery, the NCCN Panel recommends: 1) \nconsidering concurrent systemic therapy/RT; 2) clinical trials; or 3) PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-47 induction chemotherapy with additional management based on \nresponse.298,304  \nRadiation Therapy Fractionation  \nFractionation for RT is discussed in the algorithm (see Cancer of the \nGlottic Larynx:  Principles of Radiation Therapy  and Cancer of the \nSupraglottic Larynx: Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers ). For patients with T1, N0 disease \nof the glottic larynx, an accelerated dosing schedule of 63 Gy (2.25 Gy/fraction) is preferred over conventional fractionation (66 Gy, 2.0 \nGy/fraction), based on results of a prospective randomized trial showing \nthat thi s accelerated dosing schedule was associated with better 5- year \nlocal control, compared to a conventional dosing schedule (92% vs. 77%, respectively; P = .004), in 180 patients with stage I cancer of the glottic \nlarynx.\n169 For patients with comorbidities or travel logistics or who are older \nadults, 50–52 Gy (3.12– 3.28 Gy/fraction) may also be considered.598 A \nsecond accelerated  dosing schedule of 60 Gy (2.4 Gy/fraction)  may also \nbe used for patients with T1 –2, N0 disease based on the results of  an \nancillary study from the randomized, multicenter, phase III JCOG0701 \ntrial.599 When compared to standard fractionation (66- 70 Gy, the \naccelerated fractionation group (60– 64.8 Gy in 2.4 Gy/fraction)  showed \ngreater local control and similar 5 -year PFS ( 76.2% vs. 78.2%, \nrespectively ) in 366 patients with stage I or II squamous cell carcinoma of \nthe glottis . Cumulative incidence of late adverse events was also lower in \nthe accelerated fractionation group compared to the standard fractionation arm at 7.4% and 11.9%, respectively.  \nFollow -up/Surveillance  \nRecommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see Follow -up Recommendations  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers). Serial endoscopy is recommended during follow -up \nexaminations and may be supplemented with high- resolution, advanced radiologic imaging because of the scarring, edema, and fibrosis that occur \nin the laryngeal tissues and neck after RT- based treatment.  \nParanasal Tumors (Maxillary and Ethmoid Sinus Tumors)  \nTumors of the paranasal sinuses are rare,  and patients are often \nasymptomatic until late in the course of their disease. Tumors of the \nmaxillary sinus are more common than those of the ethmoid sinus or nasal \ncavity.399 Workup is similar for ethmoid and maxillary sinus tumors (see \nEthmoid Sinus Tumors  and Maxillary Sinus Tumors  in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Head and Neck Cancer s). \nAlthough the most common histology for these tumors is squamous cell \ncarcinoma, a variety of  histologies have been reported including intestinal \ntype adenocarcinoma, esthesioneuroblastoma (also known as olfactory \nneuroblastoma),  minor salivary gland tumors, and undifferentiated \ncarcinoma ( eg, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma [SNUC] , small cell \ncarcinoma, midline NUT carcinoma, and sinonasal neuroendocrine  \ncarcinoma [SNEC] ).600- 604 The defining features of esthesioneuroblastoma, \nSNUC, and SNEC continue to be debated,605 and correct pathologic \ndiagnosis is paramount for treatment decision- making.

These neoplasms are of ten found after a routine nasal polypectomy or during the \ncourse of a nasal endoscopic examination. For a patient with gross residual disease left behind after an initial endoscopic procedure, an \noncologically complete resection of the residual tumor is required. This \nmay be done endoscopically or with an open approach. In some \ninstances, this procedure may entail an anterior craniofacial resection to \nremove the cribriform plate and intracranial component of the tumor to \nensure clear surgical margins. Nodal involvement is rare in ethmoid sinus \ntumors, and, when present, lymph node metastasis is ass ociated with poor \nprognosis.\n609 Patients with ethmoid sinus cancer who have N+ neck \ndisease should undergo neck dissection with adjuvant therapy as \nappropriate based on the presence of adverse histopathological features. \nPatients with high- grade tumors have worse survival outcomes compa red \nto those with low -grade tumors.610 \nOften patients with ethmoid sinus cancer present after having had an \nincomplete endoscopic resection. The patient who is diagnosed after \nincomplete resection (eg, polypectomy with histologically positive \nmargin) —and has no documented residual disease on physical \nexamination, imaging, and/or endoscopy —should be treated with surgical \nresection to obtain oncologically appropriate margins if feasible (see  \nEthmoid Sinus Tumors  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers). If no adverse pathologic features are found, complete surgical \nresection may obviate the need for postoperative RT in T1 patients only (category 2B). In patients with high- risk pathologic features, such as \npositive or close margins adjacent to vital structures, high- grade lesions or \nother unfavorable histology, intracranial and/or intraorbital extension, cribriform plate or medial wall of orbit location, and/or perineural and \nlymphovascular space invasion, postoperative systemic therapy/RT can \nbe considered.  \nRT or concurrent systemic therapy/RT may be considered as definitive \ntreatment in patients for whom an oncologically satisfactory surgical \nresection is not possible. Radiation therapy  fractionation for patients with \nethmoid sinus tumors is described in Ethmoid Sinus Tumors : Principles of \nRadiation Therapy  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers. \nIMRT or PBT is  recommended due to the proximity of this anatomic area \nto the optic structures  and to minimize dose to critical structures ; PBT \nshould be considered if the normal tissue constraints cannot be met by IMRT.\n  \nSystemic therapy/RT may be considered to preserve the orbital contents \nand avoid incomplete surgery in patients with T4 disease, based on limited \ncase series.611,612 In these patients, induction and concurrent \nchemotherapy may be given in combination with RT. A retrospective study including 123 patients with stage III or IV sinonasal squamous cell \ncarcinoma treated from 1988 to 2017 at an NCCN Member Institution \nshowed an ORR of 62.6% (71 partial responses, 6 complete responses) \nfollowing treatment with induction chemotherapy using regimens typical for \nSCCHN.\n613 Two-year OS, 2 -year DFS, and rate of orbital preservation \nwere 61.4%, 67.9%, and 81.5%, respectively. Distant metastasis occurred in only 6.5%.  \nSystemic therapy should routinely be part of the overall treatment for \npatients with SNUC with neuroendocrine features; small cell, high -grade \nolfactory esthesioneuroblastoma ; midline NUT; or SNEC histologies  The \noptimal regimen for these patients is not well -defined, but typically PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

In a single \ncenter retrospective study including 95 patients with SNUC, concurrent \nsystemic therapy/RT following complete or  partial response to induction \nchemotherapy (ie, etoposide with platinum -based therapy) was associated \nwith a 5 -year DSS rate of 81% (95% CI, 69% –88%), compared to 59% \n(95% CI, 53% –66%) for the entire sample.\n626 The DSS rate for patients \nwho received surgery with adjuvant therapy following a less than partial \nresponse to induction chemotherapy was 39% (95% CI, 30% –46%). \nDefinitive trials of induction chemotherapy prior to surgery are currently underway within the U.S. cooperative groups.  \nFor patients with metastatic disease, options include platinum combined \nwith etoposide (with or without concurrent RT)\n614,627,628 and \ncyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine (category 2B). While there \nremains no known effective treatment for metastatic midline NUT \ncarcinoma, there are targeted therapies such as bromodomain inhibitors \nunder active investigation.629,630 Because of a paucity of data concerning \nthe use of systemic therapies, appropriate use of other systemic options, including immunotherapy, remains undefined.  \nMaxillary Sinus Tumors  \nSurgical resection followed by postoperative radiotherapy remains a \ncornerstone of treatment for most maxillary sinus tumors, except limited \nextent T1– 2 tumors resected with negative margins (see Maxillary Sinus \nTumors  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).\n631- 634 The principles are generally similar to those described above for ethmoid sinus tumors. For patients with SNUC with neuroendocrine features; small cell, \nhigh- grade olfactory esthesioneuroblastoma; or midline NUT or SNEC \nhistologies, systemic therapy should be routinely included as part of the \ntreatment plan (see Ethmoid Sinus Tumors in this Discussion). \nParticipation in clinical trials is recommended for patients with malignant \ntumors of the paranasal sinuses with these histologies.  \nRT fractionation for patients with maxillary sinus tumors is described in \nMaxillary Sinus Tumors : Principles of Radi ation Therapy  in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Head and Neck Cancers. Studies using IMRT have shown \nthat it reduces the incidence of complications, such as radiation- induced \nophthalmic toxicity , although the 5- year OS rate was not \nimproved.\n225,633,635- 638 Similar to the recommendation for ethmoid sinus \ntumors, IMRT or PBT is recommended in this anatomic area due to \nproximity to the visual structures and proton therapy is preferred if the \nnormal tissue constraints cannot be met by IMRT.  \nFollow -up  \nRecommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see \nFollow -up Recommendations  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers).  \nVery Advanced Head and Neck Cancers  \nThe algorithms for very advanced H&N cancers include: 1) newly \ndiagnosed (M0) locally advanced T4b, N0– 3, or newly diagnosed \nunresectable regional nodal disease, or those unfit for surgery; 2) metastatic disease at initial presentation (M1); 3) or recurrent or persistent \ndisease with or without distant metastases.

For patients with widely metastatic disease, \nthe goal is palliation or prolongation of life.  \nTreatment  \nThe treatment of patients with unresectable locoregional, persistent, recurrent, or metastatic H&N cancers is dictated by the patient’s PS and \nintent of treatment (ie, palliative vs. curative). Patients with good PS may \ntolerate a wide range of treatment options, whereas patients with reduced \nPS cannot.  \nNewly Diagnosed Locoregionally Advanced Disease  \nIn patients with a PS of 0 or 1, the recommended treatment of newly \ndiagnosed, very advanced disease is concurrent systemic therapy/RT, \nwith a large amount of phase III data supporting high- dose cisplatin as a \ncategory 1 preferred recommendation (see Primary Systemic Therapy with Concurrent RT under  Systemic Therapy in this Discussion ).\n273,298 There \nare also considerable phase III data from Europe that support the use of \ncarboplatin/5 -FU with concurrent RT .182 This treatment is also considered \na category 1 preferred option. Cisplatin- based induction systemic therapy \nhas been studied, followed by RT alone or chemoradiation with weekly \nplatinum or cetuximab .324 However, an improvement in OS with the \nincorporation of induction chemotherapy, compared to proceeding directly \nto state -of-the-art concurrent systemic therapy/RT, has not been \nestablished in randomized studies .316,317 Cetuximab with concurrent RT is \na category 2B option based on phase II and phase III data but is distinctly \ninferior to cisplatin with concurrent RT, particularly in patients with HPV -\npositive disease, as discussed above (see Primary Systemic Therapy with Concurrent RT under Systemic Therapy in this Discussion ).\n144,291,295,296,639 \nOther chemoradiation options include carboplatin/paclitaxel (category 2B based on less Panel consensus), weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m\n2, and \ndocetaxel (for patients not eligible for cisplatin).144,640- 643 Category 2B \nchemoradiation options that the Panel has deemed useful only in select circumstances are 5- FU/hydroxyurea, cisplatin with infusional 5 -FU, and \ncisplatin/paclitaxel .644,645 \nOther options for patients with a PS of 2– 4 are described in the algorithm  \n(see Very Advanced Head and Neck Cancer: Treatment of Newly \nDiagnosed (M0) T4b, N0 –3 or Unresectable Nodal Disease or Unfit for \nSurgery  in the N CCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). Primary \nsystemic therapy/RT regimens are listed in the Principles of Systemic \nTherapy  for Non- Nasopharyngeal Cancers  in the NCCN Guidelines for \nHead and Neck Cancers. Radiation therapy fractionation for patients with \nnewly diagnosed, very advanced di sease is described in the Very \nAdvanced Head and Neck Cancer s: Principles of Radiation Therapy  in the \nNCCN Guidelines for  Head and Neck Cancers.  \nMetastatic Disease  \nFor patients with metastatic (M1) disease at initial presentation, enrollment \nin a clinical trial is preferred. Palliative adjunctive measures include RT, \nsurgery, analgesics, and other therapies to control manifestations of \ndisease spread (eg, pain, hypercalcemia, malnutrition). Locoregional \ntreatment (eg, surgery, RT, ablative therapies) may be used for \noligometastatic disease .646- 648 \nHistorically, single -agent and combination systemic therapy have both \nbeen used.563 Response rates to single- agent therapies range from 15% to \n35%.564,649,650 Randomized trials assessing a cisplatin- based combination \nregimen (cisplatin/5 -FU) versus single- agent therapy with cisplatin, 5 -FU, \nor methotrexate showed significantly higher response rates, but no \ndifference in OS and greater toxicity for the combinati on \nregimen.553,554,557,651,652 Complete response is associated with longer \nsurvival and, although infrequent, has been reported more often with \ncombination regimens .554 A phase III randomized trial (EXTREME) of 442 \npatients found that cetuximab plus cisplatin/5- FU or carboplatin/5 -FU \nimproved response rate (36% vs. 20%; P  < .001)  and median survival PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

In the total population, an OS \nbenefit was observed in the pembrolizumab/platinum/5 -FU arm, \ncompared to the EXTREME arm (median OS , 13 vs. 10.7 months, \nrespectively; HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63– 0.93; P = .003). PFS, however, did \nnot significantly differ between these two study arms. Median duration of \nresponse was greater in patients treated with pembrolizumab \nmonotherapy or pembrolizumab with chem otherapy, compared to \npatients treated with the EXTREME regimen.  \nResults from KEYNOTE -048 showed that, in patients with a PD -L1 CPS \nof ≥20 or ≥1, median OS was better in patients who received \npembrolizumab monotherapy, compared to those who received the \nEXTREME regimen (median,  14.9 vs. 10.7 months, respectively; HR, \n0.61; 95% CI, 0.45– 0.83; P < .001 for CPS ≥20; median , 12.3 vs. 10.3 \nmonths, respectively; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64– 0.96; P = .009 for CPS \n≥1).654 In an update with a median study follow -up of 45.0 months, OS  \nimproved with pembrolizumab in the PD -L1 CPS ≥ 20 (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, \n0.46– 0.81) and CPS ≥1 populations (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61– 0.89).657 \nOS improved with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in the PD -L1 CPS \n≥ 20 (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46– 0.84), CPS ≥1 (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53 –\n0.78), and total (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59 –0.85) populations. This supports CPS ≥1 for pembrolizumab monotherapy, and no PD -L1-based selection \nfor combination of chemotherapy and pembrolizumab . No formal \ncomparison exists between both pembrolizumab -containing arms, and \nthe selection of regimens remains based on clinical judgement. The one \ndifference observed was that the PFS of subsequent therapy  was similar \nafter pembrolizumab and longer after pembrolizumab  and taxane -\ncontaining chemotherapy and shorter after pembrolizumab and similar \nafter pembrolizumab  and non -taxane– containing chemotherapy .  \nThe Panel considers immunotherapy as the preferred first -line systemic \ntherapy option for all patients with recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic disease who have no surgical or radiotherapeutic option. Specifically, \npembrolizumab alone (for patients with CPS ≥1) o r \npembrolizumab/platinum/5 -FU are both category 1 preferred first -line \noptions based on the results of KEYNOTE -048; the combination regimen \nmay be particularly suitable in patients with a PS of 0 or 1 and either a large burden of disease or neari ng a clinical crisis .\n654 Other combination \nregimens recommended by the Panel for treatment of metastatic SCCHN \ninclude: 1) cisplatin or carboplatin, plus 5- FU with cetuximab (category \n1)653; 2) cisplatin or carboplatin, plus a taxane552,553; 3) cisplatin with \ncetuximab558,658; 4) cisplatin with 5 -FU553,554; or 5) cetuximab with a \nplatinum and a taxane .658-662 Extrapolating from Guigay et al ,662 a taxane \ncan be considered, when used in combination with pembrolizumab and a \nplatinum .654 Cetuximab combined with an anti –PD-1 antibody \n(pembrolizumab or nivolumab) is also an option for recurrent or \nmetastatic SCCHN based on results from non -randomized phase II \ntrials .663,664  \nOther options that the Panel considers useful in certain circumstances \nfor patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN are cisplatin/pemetrexed (for PS 0 –1 only ),\n665 cetuximab with a taxane ,658,662 \ngemcitabine/paclitaxel ,666 and nivolumab/ipilimumab (CPS ≥20 and first -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Single agents recommended by the Panel include \ncisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, 5 -FU, methotrexate, \ncapecitabine, and cetuximab .554,557- 565,567,568,668,669 \nLocoregionally Recurrent or Persistent Disease  \nA multidisciplinary evaluation is critical in defining appropriate therapy for \npatients with local and/or regional disease recurrence or persistence \nwithout distant metastasis. A subset of these patients can be approached \nwith curative intent local therapy , and the therapeutic options depend on \nseveral factors, including: type of prior therapy (surgery vs. radiation), \ninterval between prior therapy and recurrence, desire for functional \npreservation, and patient PS.  \nIn general, surgery is recommended for resectable recurrent or persistent \nlocoregional disease, in the absence of distant metastatic disease; \nadjuvant therapy depends on pathologic risk factors. Patients with \nresectable recurrent or persistent locoregional  disease who have not \npreviously been treated with RT may also be treated with concurrent \nsystemic therapy/RT (high- dose cisplatin is the preferred [category 1] \nsystemic agent ).273 Combination systemic therapy followed by RT or \nsystemic therapy/RT (category 2B) may be considered for cytoreduction or \nsymptom control, followed by local therapy such as surgery as clinically \nindicated.  \nAmong patients with unresectable recurrence or persistence in a previously non- irradiated field, RT with concurrent systemic therapy is \nrecommended, with the duration of RT and choice of systemic agent dependent on the PS. No randomized data exist that def ine a preferred \nsystemic therapy/RT combination in this setting, although early -phase \nstudies have explored carboplatin, PD -1 inhibitors, and cetuximab. In \nsituations where patient or tumor factors render patients as poor candidates for curative- intent radiation or surgery, the treatment approach is the same as that for patients with metastatic disease; however, in the \nabsence of distant metastatic disease and/or in the presence of \nsymptoms, re -irradiation with systemic therapy is increasingly feasible \n(see below). Locoregional treatment such as palliative radiation may be \nconsidered in the presence of distant metastasis with locoregional failure  \nto alleviate tumor burden -related symptoms . RT fractionation for patients \nwith recurrent or persistent disease is  described in Very Advanced Head \nand Neck Cancer s: Principles of Radiation Therapy  in the NCCN \nGuidelines for  Head and Neck Cancers).  \nReirradiation  \nReirradiation may be offered to patients with locally and/or regionally \nrecurrent or persistent H&N cancer, using IMRT, PBT, or SBRT. A \nrandomized phase III multicenter trial in France ( N = 130) showed that \nreirradiation combined with systemic therapy in patients following a resected recurrence improves DFS, compared to patients receiving only \nsurgery (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.13– 2.50; P = .01 ).\n670 However, the toxicity of \nthis regimen was considerable, with grade 3 of 4 acute toxicity (mucositis/pharyngitis) in 28% of patients; however, results achieved using \nthe older techniques in this study may not apply to the current day. As previously stated,  SBRT has been investigated only in small series and \nstudies .\n268,269  \nWhen concurrent systemic therapy is given with conventionally fractionated reirradiation, cisplatin with concurrent RT is the preferred \noption for individuals with unresectable recurrent or persistent disease \nwho received prior RT.\n142,641 The Panel also recommends carboplatin, \ncetuximab, or docetaxel with concurrent RT as useful in certain circumstances as a reirradiation and concurrent systemic therapy option \n(all category 2B ).\n144,291,543,545 \nAdvanced RT techniques should be used for reirradiation.

Intraoperative RT (IORT) and \nbrachytherapy may also be used for select patients at high- volume \ncenters .672- 674 Intraoperative RT is usually dosed at 10– 15 Gy and followed \nby 40—50 Gy using EBRT preferably IMRT.675 \nThe decision to treat with reirradiation should take into account comorbidity, the toxicity of previous treatment methods, organ dysfunction, \nand the amount of time that has passed since previous treatment .\n676- 679 \nTreatment planning should at a minimum take brainstem, spinal cord and \nlaryngeal lifetime dose limits  into account so that the safest maximum \ndose is delivered .676,680,681 PBT may be used for reirradiation when normal \ntissue constraints cannot be met by photon -based therapy .585,682- 684 \nRetrospective studies show that PBT used for reirradiation may be \nassociated with good outcomes (eg, 65% –84% OS, improved locoregional \ncontrol, freedom from distant metastasis) and acceptable toxicity .252,682,683 \nHowever, in one retrospective study, three patients died (out of 60), \npossibly due to reirradiation- related effects .682 \nDosing schedules that may be used for reirradiation are described in \nRadiation Techniques in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers. Radiation volumes should usually include only volumes of known \ndisease, to minimize the amount of tissue receiving high doses in \npreviously irradiated regions. Therefore, prophylactic treatment (eg, \nelectiv e nodal irradiation) is not routinely indicated .685 There are currently knowledge gaps regarding the appropriate use of reirradiation, and \npatients should be encouraged to enroll in clinical trials .585,676 \nDisease That Has Progressed on or After Platinum Therapy  \nAfter progression of disease on platinum -based therapy, options are listed \nin the Guidelines  (see Principles of Systemic Therapy for Non -\nNasopharyngeal Cancer: Recurrent, Unresectable, or Metastatic  in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).

Pembrolizumab was also \ngenerally well -tolerated.\n686 Pooled analyses after long- term follow -up of \nthe initial and expansion cohorts ( N = 192) showed a 1 -year OS rate of \n38%.688 Among the 34 patients with a disease response, 85% of the \nresponses lasted 6 months or longer, and 71% lasted 12 months or \nlonger. The FDA has approv ed an alternate dosing regimen of \npembrolizumab 400 mg every 6  weeks across all currently approved \nadult indications . \nBased on results of the phase Ib KEYNOTE -012 trial, pembrolizumab \nwas evaluated in the phase III KEYNOTE -040 trial .655 Patients with \nrecurrent or metastatic SCCHN ( N = 495) were randomized to receive \npembrolizumab or another systemic therapy (methotrexate, docetaxel, or \ncetuximab). Median OS was greater for the pembrolizumab arm \ncompared to the standard- of-care arm (8.4 vs. 6.9 months; HR, 0.80; \n95% CI, 0.65– 0.98; P = .016). When analyses were stratified by PD -L1 \nstatus, the results for OS were significantly better with pembrolizumab \nonly for patients with tumors that have PD -L1 expression. A post hoc \nsubgroup analysis of the KEYNOTE- 040 trial evaluated outcomes in patients with recurrent -only ( N = 125), recurrent and metastatic ( N = \n204), or metastatic -only ( N = 166) disease.689 Median OS for \npembrolizumab compared to the standard -of-care arm in the recurrent -\nonly group was 8.7 months (95% CI, 5.6 –15.2)  and 7 months (95% CI, \n5.1–9.6), respectively. In the recurrent and metastatic, and metastatic -\nonly groups OS for pembrolizumab versus standard -of-care therapy was \n6.7 months (95% CI, 5.2 –9.2) and 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.2 –7.3), and 8.9 \nmonths (95% CI, 7.1 –12.1)  and 7.9 months (95% CI, 6.3 –9.2), \nrespectively. No differences in PFS were reported, regardless of \ntreatment arm or subgroup. Exploratory health- related QOL analyses \nshowed that patients treated with pembrolizumab had stable functioning and symptoms through 15 weeks, compared to the patients treated with \nstandard of care, for whom a decline was observed.\n690 Pembrolizumab \nmonotherapy was also evaluated for previously treated tumors with high \nmicrosatellite instability (MSI -H)/mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) in \nthe phase II KEYNOTE -158 basket trial, which included one patient with \nSCCHN.691 The ORR for the entire sample (N = 233) was 34.3% (95% \nCI, 28.3% –40.8%), median PFS was 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.4 –4.9), and \nmedian OS was 23.5 months (95% CI, 13.5 months –not reached).  \nThe nonrandomized phase II KEYNOTE -055 trial studied pembrolizumab \nin 171 patients with SCCHN that progressed following treatment with \nboth a platinum and cetuximab .692 The ORR was 16% (95% CI, 11% –\n23%), and the mean duration of response was 8 months.  \nAfatinib was compared to methotrexate in patients with recurrent or \nmetastatic H&N cancer who had progressed on or after platinum -based \ntherapy ( N = 483) in the phase III LUX -Head & Neck 1 RCT .693 Patients \nrandomized to receive afatinib had greater PFS compared to patients \nrandomized to receive methotrexate (2.6 vs. 1.7 months; P = .03), but \nthere were no significant differences for OS .693 A randomized phase II \ntrial comparing afatinib to cetuximab in patients with recurrent or PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

Even though the basket trial contained no patients \nwith TMB -H SCCHN, the Panel has included pembrolizumab for TMB -H \ndisease as an option for patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN based on the FDA approval. Despite the ambiguities of PD -L1 testing and \ndefinitions, PD -L1 expression may be associated wi th better outcomes \nfrom treatment with immunotherapy for recurrent or metastatic SCCHN (ie, \ngreater likelihood of response to pembrolizumab and greater survival \nbenefit in response to nivolumab). The Panel included fam -trastuzumab \nderuxtecan -nxki for HER2 -positive disease (in the subsequent line setting \nwith no satisfactory alternative treatment options) based on the 2024 FDA \napproval for all solid tumors. However, the DESTINY -PanTumor02 basket \ntrial include d <5 patients with non- salivary head and neck canc ers.\n695 \nTherefore, this is a category 2B option based on less Panel consensus. \nErdafitinib has also been included as an option for non -nasopharyngeal \ntumors with FGFR  mutations or fusions and disease progression with at \nleast one line of prior systemic therapy and no availability of an alternative systemic therapy. This is a category 2B recommendation and is based on \nthe single- arm phase II RAGNAR study, which evaluated the efficacy and \nactivity of erdafitinib in 217 previously treated patients with FGFR -mutated \nsolid tumors .\n696 Only 15 of the 217 patients were diagnosed with SCCHN. Data showed a reduction in tumor burden for 159 (73%) participants. At a \nmedian follow -up for efficacy at 17.9 months, 30% ( 95% CI , 24–36) (n = \n64) of participants had an objective response, of which 6 (3%) had a \ncomplete response. For all other systemic therapy options recommended \nby the Panel , there are no clear advantages of one agent over another in \nthe subsequent -line setting, although response rates seem to be highest \nwith taxanes. Afatinib has a PFS benefit, but not an OS benefit, over \nmethotrexate693 and is a category 2B systemic therapy option for non-\nnasopharyngeal persistent H&N cancer or cancer that has progressed on \nor after platinum -containing chemotherapy.  \nOccult Primary Cancer \nOccult or unknown primary H&N cancer  is defined as metastatic \ncarcinoma in a cervical lymph node without an identifiable primary site \nafter appropriate investigation. This is an uncommon disease entity, \naccounting for approximately  5% of patients presenting to referral centers. \nThe most frequent histology is squamous cell carcinoma. Although \npatients with very small tonsil and tongue base cancers frequently present \nwith enlarged neck nodes and are initially classified as having an unknown \nprimary, most will eventually be diagnosed by directed biops y and \ntonsillectomy . The emergence of the primary site after therapy and during \nfollow up is rare. H&N cancer of unknown primary site is a highly curable \ndisease. After appropriate evaluation and treatment, most patients \nexperience low morbidity and long- term disease control .  \nWorkup  \nThe majority of patients >40 years of age who present with a neck mass \nprove to have malignant lymph node involvement . In situations where \nmetastatic carcinoma is found in cervical lymph nodes, the primary site  is \nalmost always discovered in the course of a complete H&N examination \nand imaging evaluation.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nHead and Neck Cancers   \n \nMS-56 necrotic lymph nodes may be non -diagnostic, and , in these situations , a \ncore biopsy may be obtained. Open biopsy should not be performed \nunless the patient is prepared for definitive surgical management of the \nmalignancy , which may entail a neck dissection, and patients should be \ncounseled accordingly in the preoperative period.  \nPatients with a biopsy -proven carcinoma of a cervical lymph node require \na thorough history with emphasis on tobacco exposure, prior cancer history, including previous ly resected early -stage cutaneous malignancies, \nand ethnic descent from endemic NPC regions. A physical examination \ndocumenting cervical lymph node levels may inform potential primary \nsites. These patients require dedicated imaging of the H&N. This can be \naccomplished through contrast -enhanced CT imaging. An FDG -PET/CT \nmay reveal a primary sit e not visible on contrast -enhanced CT \nimaging.\n697,698  \nWhen a needle biopsy shows squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, \nor anaplastic/undifferentiated epithelial cancer without a primary site, \nadditional studies are needed (see Occult Primary  in the NCCN Guidelines \nfor Head and Neck Cancers). High- risk HPV and EBV testing are \nrecommended for squamous cell or undifferentiated histology , and p16+ \nunknown primary disease should only be considered HPV -positive with \nHPV-specific testing .566,699- 703 High-risk HPV and EBV testing can be useful \nin workup and management of cancers of the neck of unknown primary, \nand patients with EBV - or HPV -related cervical adenopathy are staged \naccording to the classification for nasopharyngeal and HPV -positive \noropharyngeal cancer, respectively.704,705  \nA thorough operative examination of at -risk mucosal sites is an important \ncomponent in the workup of a patient with an occult primary, especially in \nscenarios where CT or PET imaging do not reveal the primary site. During \nthis procedure, directed biopsies of areas of mucosal abnormalities \nsuspi cious for the primary site are undertaken. Random ly directed biopsies of normal -appearing mucosa in potential primary sites have a low \nyield and seldom disclose a primary cancer. Many primary cancers are \nidentified af ter tonsillectomy. However, the therapeutic benefit of this \nsurgery is uncertain because,  when patients have been treated without \ntonsillectomy, only a few develop a clinically significant primary tumor.  \nTreatment  \nNeck dissection is recommended for all patients with thyroglobulin- negative and calcitonin- negative adenocarcinoma (see \nOccult Primary  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). If \nthe metastatic adenocarcinoma presents high in the neck, parotidectomy \nmay be included with the neck dissection. After neck dissection, management depends on the findings (ie, N1 without extranodal \nextension, N2 or N3 without extranodal extension, or extranodal \nextension) (see Occult Primary  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and \nNeck Cancers).  \nDue to the infrequency of this disease, high- level prospective evidence to \nguide clinical management is lacking. Among NCCN Member Institutions, \nsignificant variation exists regarding the management of squamous cell \ncarcinoma, poorly differentiated or nonk eratinizing squamous cell \ncarcinoma, anaplastic cancer (not thyroid) of unknown primary site, or other uncommon histologies. The Panel members believe such patients \nshould be treated with a neck dissection.  RT is also an option for patients \nwith N1 disease, as a  retrospective single- institution study showed that \nIMRT in patients with cervical lymph node metastasis from an unknown \nprimary was associated with good local control and survival outcomes .\n706 \nAmong N2– 3 squamous cell carcinomas with occult primary that are not \nmanaged surgically, recommendations are based on less Panel \nconsensus: concurrent systemic therapy/RT (category 2B) or induction \nchemotherapy followed by chemoradiation or RT (category 3).

Since HPV -positive occult \nprimary is likely located in the tonsil or base of tongue regions, radiation \ntargets may be limited to these mucosal regions (see Cancer of the \nOropharynx [p16  (HPV) -positive] in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and \nNeck Cancers).433  \nPostoperative therapy among patients with occult primary squamous cell \ncarcinoma is based on the amount of nodal disease and the presence or \nabsence of extranodal extension. For N1 disease without extranodal \nextension, NCCN Panel members  recommend either: 1) RT that \nencompasses the target volume; or 2) careful observation with regular \nH&N examinations. Postoperative RT or consideration of concurrent \nchemoradiation (category 2B for chemoradiation) is recommended for N2 \nor N3 disease without  extranodal extens ion (see Occult Primary  in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers). For extranodal extension, \nconcurrent chemoradiation is a category 1 recommendation; RT alone is \nan option (see Occult Primary  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers).138,139  \nDefinitive and postoperative treatment of EBV -positive disease should be \ntreated as nasopharyngeal cancer (see Cancer of the Nasopharynx in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers).707 \nSalivary Gland Tumors  \nSalivary gland tumors  can arise in the major salivary glands (ie, parotid, \nsubmandibular, sublingual) or in one of the minor salivary glands, which \nare widely spread throughout the aerodigestive tract.708 Many minor \nsalivary gland tumors are located on the hard palate. Approximately 20% \nof the parotid gland tumors are malignant; the incidence of malignancy in \nsubmandibular and minor salivary gland tumors is approximately 50% and \n80%, respectively. These malignant tumors constitute a broad spectrum of \nhistologic types, including mucoepidermoid, acinic, adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, malignant myoepithelial tumors, and squamous \ncell carcinoma. The primary diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the  \nparotid gland is rare; however, the parotid gland is a frequent site of \nmetastasis from skin cancer.709 Prognosis and tendency to metastasize \nvary among these histologic types. Major prognostic factors are histologic \ngrade, tumor size, and local invasion. Staging is done using the AJCC \nCancer Staging Manual (8th edition).400 \nTreatment  \nThe major therapeutic approach for salivary gland tumors is adequate and \nappropriate surgical resection.710- 713 Surgical intervention requires careful \nplanning and execution, particularly in parotid tumor surgery because the facial nerve is in the gland. The gland should be preserved if the nerve is \nnot directly involved by the tumor. Most parotid gland tumors are located in \nthe superficial lobe. If the facial nerve is functioning preoperatively, the \nnerve can be preserved in most patients.\n714 The facial nerve should be \nsacrificed if there is preoperative facial nerve involvement with facial palsy or if there is direct invasion of the tumor into the nerve where the tumor \ncannot be separated from the nerve. Malignant deep lobe parotid tumors \nare rare; however, they are generally a challenge for the surgeon because \nthe patient may require superficial parotidectomy and identification and retraction of the facial nerve to remove the deep lobe parotid tumor.  \nThe Panel recommends highly conformal RT techniques such as IMRT, \nproton, or other heavy ions for definitive radiation treatment. Results from \na retrospective cohort study including 545 patients with salivary gland \ntumors treated between 1997 and 2010 showed better local control and \nsurvival outcomes with neutron therapy, relative to photon therapy.\n715 \nHowever, risk of late effects with neutron therapy is high and tends to increase over time, with estimates as high as 20% at 9 years.\n716,717 \nNeutron therapy is no longer routinely recommended for treatment of  \nsalivary gland cancers due to  the diminishing demand, concerns regarding PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:59 PM.

The panel recognizes \nthe potential clinical value of neutron therapy for select patients.  \nMost malignant deep lobe parotid tumors will require postoperative RT \nbecause of adverse pathologic features such as the limitations of surgical \nmargins in the resection of these tumors.710,712,718 RT is also used  in an \nadjuvant setting for tumors with other adverse pathologic features (eg, \nintermediate, high- grade, T3– 4 tumors, or positive lymph nodes)711,719,720; \nsystemic therapy /RT (category 2B) can also be considered.721 Efficacy \ndata for  systemic therapy /RT for patients with advanced salivary gland \ntumors that have been resected are limited. E xtensive safety data are \navailable and may be extrapolated from the management of SCCHN, with \nsome NCCN Member Institutions using platinum -based regimens for these \npatients . With regard to  unresectable salivary gland tumors, the NCCN \nPanel had less consensus about chemoradiation (which is reflected in the \ncategory 2B recommendations), because there are few  published trials. \nClinical trials are ongoing in this area (eg, NCT01220583, NCT02776163).  \nSystemic Therapy  \nTargeted  systemic  therapy is increasingly becoming an option for patients \nwith distant metastatic salivary gland tumors. NGS and other biomarker \ntests should be used to evaluate at least the following:  AR, NTRK , FGFR , \nBRAF, RET, MSI, dMMR,  TMB , PD-L1, and HER2 status.574,696,722- 733 \nSince HER2 -testing guidelines are currently not available for patients with \nsalivary gland cancers, the Panel refers to the ASCO/CAP guidelines for \nHER2 -testing of breast cancers ( https://www.cap.org/protocols -and-\nguidelines/cap- guidelines/current -cap-guidelines/recommendations -for-\nhuman- epidermal -growth- factor -2-testing -in-breast -cancer ). \nA significant number of advanced salivary gland tumors with distant metastases are androgen receptor -positive (AR+).\n724- 728 Therefore, the \nPanel recommends that patients with tumors that are AR+ receive androgen receptor therapy ( ie, leuprolide, bicalutamide, abiraterone, \ngoserelin).728,734- 737 \nTwo phase I/II studies including patients with advanced NTRK  gene \nfusion- positive cancer (with 22% –38% being salivary gland tumors) \nshowed promising objective response rates of 75% to 100% with the TRK inhibitor larotrectinib.\n729,730 A pooled analysis from a phase II trial and two \nphase I trials including 54 patients with NTRK  gene fusion- positive cancer \n(13% being mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of the salivary gland) \nshowed an objective response rate of 57.4% for entrectinib, another TRK \ninhibitor.731 Finally, repotrectinib was evaluated in a phase I/II study \nincluding 88 patients with NTRK gene fusion- positive advanced solid \ntumors (48 previously treated with a TRK TKI, and 40 who were TRK TKI -\nnaïve).738 Eleven patients (12.5%) had a salivary gland tumor. The \nanalysis showed an objective response rate of 58% for those who were \nTRK TKI -naïve, and 50% in those who were previously treated with a TRK \nTKI. The FDA approved larotrectinib,  entrectinib, and repotrectinib for \ntreatment of patients with NTRK  gene fusion- positive tumors, and the \nPanel also recommends  these three  NTRK  therapy options for patients \nwith recurrent NTRK  gene fusion- positive salivary gland tumors and \ndistant metastases.  \nHER2 positivity has also been found in some advanced salivary gland \ntumors.726,728,739 It is recommended that these patients receive a HER2-\ntargeted treatment option such as trastuzumab.728,740 Small series \ndemonstrate that ado- trastuzumab emtansine may be active in patients \nwith previously treated metastatic HER2- positive salivary gland \ncancers.741,742 Nonrandomized phase II trials have also examined \ntrastuzumab combined with other agents for patients with advanced \nHER2 -positive salivary gland cancers.

The median PFS was 8.9 months (95% CI, 7.8– 9.9), \nand OS was 39.7 months (95% CI, not reached). A significant number of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in this study (89%, with grade \n4 adverse events being reported in 61% ). The most common serious \nadverse events were hematologic: decreased white blood cell, neutrophil, \nand lymphocyte counts. R esults from the ongoing open- label phase II \nMyPathway basket study, including 16 patients with advanced HER2 -\npositive, -overexpressed, or - amplified salivary gland cancers, showed that \npertuzumab combined with trastuzumab was associated with a 60% ORR.\n744 Median duration of response for these patients was 9.2 months , \nand the regimen was well -tolerated (ie, only one grade 3 treatment -related \nadverse event).  In a pooled analysis of two studies including 17 patients \nwith HER2 -positive salivary duct carcinoma, fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan-\nnxki was associated with an ORR of 47% (all partial responses).745 Results \nare currently only available in abstract form.

Thus, the AJCC staging system for MM begins with T3, N0 \ndisease as the most limited form of disease ( T staging similar to anaplastic \nthyroid carcinoma) , and the staging  reflect s the local burden of disease, as \nwell as regional and distant extent. In addition, the AJCC staging s ystem \nreflects the fact that MM  occur s at all mucosal sites in the H&N. Therefore, \nrules for classifying, staging, and surgical principles should be based on \nthe appropriate anatomic site of origin. Workup for these tumors is \ndescribed in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers.  \nTreatment  \nAlthough limited data exist on treatment options, primary treatment s hould \nbe surgical for T3, N0– 1 and T4a, N0– 1 disease . For T4b  disease, \nalthough surgery is not generally considered, a multidisciplinary team \ndiscussion is suggested to ensure appropriate care.766 Neck dissection \nwith postoperative radiation is recommended for clinical nodal \ndisease.767,768 Postoperative r adiation to the primary site is typically  indicated in most  cases , as there is evidence that it  improv es local control . \nPostoperative RT to the neck depends on the extent of nodal \ninvolvement .769- 771 NCCN strongly encourages clinical trials for all patients \nwith MM to better define treatment choices at all stages of the disease.  \nRadiation  Therapy  \nThe role of RT  in MM has not been evaluated in prospective trials . \nHowever, results of a randomized trial in cutaneous melanoma are \nconsidered relevant to MM in the postoperative setting after surgery at the \nprimary site or neck dissection (see third paragraph in this section).772 \nLocal recurrence is  common after surgery alone in MM . After using \npostoperative radiation,  lower rates of local and neck recurrence have \nbeen reported  in historical comparison series .771,773- 776 In unresectable or \nmedically inoperable cases , reasonable local control outcomes using RT  \nfollowed by systemic therapy have been reported  in small cohort series of \nMMs.777- 779  \nPrimary size or thickness is not used as a risk factor when considering RT  \nto the primary site; all invasive primaries are considered at high risk for local recurrence. For sinonasal primary sites, target volumes may include \nthe primary site without elective treatment of the neck  (see Mucosal \nMelanoma in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers) . Because \noral cavity primary sites are felt to be at a higher risk for failure in the neck,  \nelective management with neck dissection and/or  RT may be applied, \nalthough this is not routinely done (see Mucosal Melanoma in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Head and Neck Cancers) . \nRT is often recommended in the postoperative management of MMs.  \nIndications for postoperative radiation to the neck are generally \nextrapolated from  cutaneous melanoma. A n Australian- New Zealand \nconsortium reported on a randomized trial (250 patients) of postoperative RT versus observation in patients with palpable adenopathy from \ncutaneous primaries.

However, no significant differences in OS were reported. \nConsidering this trial and retrospective studies in MM, the NCCN Panel \nrecommends postoperative RT for the following high- risk features: \nextranodal extension , involvement of two  or more neck or intraparotid \nnodes, any node ≥ 3 cm, or recurrence in the neck or soft tissue after initial \nsurgical resection.780,781 Conventional fractionation is recommended ( at 2 \nGy per fraction to a total postoperative dose of 60 –66 Gy ). The \nAustralian- New Zealand randomized trial used 48 Gy in 20 fractions (240 \ncGy/fraction) to the neck, axilla,  or groin.772 However, the NCCN P anel \nprefers conventional fractionation to somewhat higher total doses (60– 66 \nGy) in the neck because of concerns about late effects from larger dose \nper fraction, which may not be fully expressed for many years after \ntreatment. The following schedules may also be used: 1) 48 –50 Gy (2.4– 3 \nGy/fraction); or 2) 30 –36 Gy (6 Gy/fraction).772,773,781 \nIMRT may be very useful in helping to achieve homogenous dose \ndistributions and to spar e critical organs, especially in paranasal sinus \nsites.225,636,782 3D-CRT may also be used, but IMRT is preferred.  Reports \nsuggest  that the use of hypofractionation in cutaneous melanomas (which \nis convenient)  is associated with good outcomes but no clear advantage in \ncancer control. Little experience is available using large dose per fraction \nin mucosal sites. Because of the close proximity of neural structures and \nrisk of late effects, hypofractionation (if used) must be carefully planned \nand delivered.782 RT should not be used concurrently with BRAF/MEK \ninhibitor therapy, as concurrent use has been found to be associated with grade ≥3 dermatologic reactions, and potentially lethal hemorrhaging in \nthe liver, lung, and brain have all been reported.\n783 For primary sites in the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity, PBT should be considered due to the proximity of eye and other vital structures.  \nSystemic Therapy  \nSystemic therapy used for cutaneous melanoma (eg, immunotherapy) is \nrecommended for MM (see Systemic Therapy for Metastatic or \nUnresectable Disease  in the NCCN Guidelines for Melanoma: Cutaneous, \navailable at www.NCCN.org ).  \nThere is currently no standard approach for systemic therapy treatment of \nresectable MM . Adjuvant systemic immunotherapy is an option for MM \nwith nodal involvement. While the majority of patients in melanoma \nadjuvant trials had cutaneous primaries, some patients with MM were \nincluded. Neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitor for MM is not well -studied. \nRecent data suggest, however, that neoadjuvant  therapy  for resectable \nMM is a feasible approach with signs of efficacy and an acceptable safety \nprofile. Further inve stigation is needed.784 More recently, data \ndemonstrate improvements in event -free survival with neoadjuvant and \nadjuvant pembrolizumab over adjuvant pembrolizumab alone in patients \nwith resectable stage III/IV melanoma.785 While this study included only a \nsmall number of patients with mucosal melanoma, it is not known whether this approach is of value for this particular melanoma subtype, \nthough it may be useful in certain situations (ie, large symptomatic \ndisease burden).  \nFollow -up  \nRecommendations for surveillance are provided in the algorithm (see Follow -up Recommendations  in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck \nCancers). Note that physical examination for MM should include endoscopic inspection for  nasal cavity and paranasal sinus disease.
