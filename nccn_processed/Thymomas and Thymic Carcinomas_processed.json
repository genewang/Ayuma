Locally advanced (unresectable) and resectable stage ≥ II cases should be discussed and evaluated by a \nmultidisciplinary team.\n• Surgical biopsy should be avoided if a resectable thymoma is strongly suspected based on clinical and radiologic features because of the \nsubstantial potential of tumor seeding when the tumor capsule is violated.\n• Biopsy of a possible thymoma should avoid a transpleural approach because of the substantial risk of converting a stage I thymoma to a \nstage IV thymoma by spreading tumor within the pleural space.\n• Prior to surgery, patients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis and should be medically controlled prior to \nundergoing surgical resection.\n• If an R0 resection is considered uncertain, patients should be considered for neoadjuvant systemic therapy. Debulking tumors is \ndiscouraged.\n• Goal of surgery is complete excision of the lesion with total thymectomy and complete resection of contiguous and noncontiguous disease.\n• Complete resection may require the resection of adjacent structures, including the pericardium, phrenic nerve, pleura, lung, and even major \nvascular structures. Bilateral phrenic nerve resection should be avoided due to severe respiratory morbidity.\n• Surgical clips should be placed at the time of resection to areas of close margins, residual disease, or tumor adhesion to unresected normal \nstructures to help guide accurate RT when indicated.\n• During thymectomy, the pleural surfaces should be examined for pleural metastases. If feasible, resection of pleural metastases to achieve \ncomplete gross resection is appropriate.\n• Minimally invasive procedures are not routinely recommended due to the lack of long-term data. However, minimally invasive procedures \nmay be considered for clinical stage I–II if all oncologic goals can be met as in standard procedures, and if performed in specialized centers \nby surgeons with experience in these techniques.1-14\nReferences on THYM-A 2 OF 2PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:10:03 PM.

They also need to communicate with the pathologist regarding the detailed pathology on histology, disease extent such as \nextracapsular extension, and surgical margins.\n• The review of preoperative imaging and co-registration of preoperative imaging into the planning system are helpful in defining treatment \nvolumes.\nRadiation Dose \n• The dose and fractionation schemes of RT depend on the indication of the radiation and the completeness of surgical resection in \npostoperative cases.\n• A dose of 60 to 70 Gy should be given to patients with unresectable disease.\n• For adjuvant treatment, the radiation dose consists of 45 to 50 Gy for clear/close margins and 54 Gy for microscopically positive resection \nmargins. A total dose of 60–70 Gy should be given to patients with gross residual disease (similar to patients with unresectable disease),3,4,5 \nwhen conventional fractionation (1.8–2.0 Gy per daily fraction) is applied. \n• Depending on the treatment objectives in the palliative setting, typical palliative doses (eg, 8 Gy in a single fraction, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 \nGy in 10 fractions) up to definitive doses for more durable local control and highly conformal techniques for limited volume metastases may \nbe appropriate, given the relatively long natural history of even metastatic thymoma.  \nRadiation Volume\n• The gross tumor volume should include any grossly visible tumor. Surgical clips indicative of gross residual tumor should be included for \npostoperative adjuvant RT.\n• The clinical target volume (CTV) for postoperative RT should encompass the entire thymus (for partial resection cases), surgical clips, and \nany potential sites with residual disease. The CTV should be reviewed with the thoracic surgeon. \n• Extensive elective nodal irradiation (ENI) (entire mediastinum and bilateral supraclavicular nodal regions) is not recommended, as thymomas \ndo not commonly metastasize to regional lymph nodes.6\n• The planning target volume (PTV) should consider the target motion and daily setup error. The PTV margin should be based on the individual \npatient’s motion, simulation techniques used (with and without inclusion motion), and reproducibility of daily setup of each clinic.\nReferences THYM-B 3 of 3PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:10:03 PM.

Since \nthese patients are younger and mostly long-term survivors, the mean total dose to the heart should be as low as reasonably achievable to \npotentially maximize survival.\n• A minimum technological standard for RT is CT-planned 3D conformal RT (3D-CRT). More advanced technologies are appropriate when \nneeded to deliver curative RT safely. These technologies include (but are not limited to) 4D-CT and/or PET/CT simulation, intensity-\nmodulated RT (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), image-guided RT (IGRT), motion management, and proton therapy. In \nparticular, IMRT is preferred over 3D-CRT. Compared to IMRT, proton therapy has been shown to improve dosimetry, thus allowing for better \nsparing of normal organs (lungs, heart, and esophagus)7 with favorable local control and toxicity, and is appropriate.8\nReferences THYM-B 3 of 3PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:10:03 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nThymomas and Thymic Carcinomas  \n \nMS-2 Overview \nThym oma and thymic carcinoma originate in the  epithelial cells of the \nthymus.1,2 Among the generally rare tumors of the anterior mediastinum, \nthymomas are the most common primary tumors and occur in \napproximately two per million per year in the United States.3,4 Thymic \ncarcinomas are even less common, with one study estimating the annual incidence  to be 0.48 per million in the United States.\n4 Although \nthymomas can spread locally, they are less  likely to be  invasive  and \nmetastasize than thymic carcinomas.5-8 Patients with thymic carcinomas \noften present with advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis.6,9-11 The \n5-year survival rate of patients with thymomas is approximately \n90%,5,12,13 while the 5-year survival  rates for patients with thymic \ncarcinoma are closer  to 60%.5,10  \nThese NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN \nGuidelines®) focus on thymomas and thymic carcinomas and outline the \nrecommendations for evaluation and treatment of patients with these \nmediastinal tumors. These NCCN Guidelines were first published in 2007 \nand have been subsequently updated on an annual basis. The NCCN \nGuidelines® for Thymomas and Thymic Carcinomas are updated by \nPanel members who are also on the NCCN Guidelines for Non- Small \nCell Lung Cancer Panel.  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria \nPrior to the annual update of the NCCN Guidelines for Thymomas and \nThymic Carcinomas, an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain key literature in thymomas and thymic carcinomas \npublished since the previous Guidelines update, using the search terms: thymomas, thymic carcinomas, and thymic epithelial tumors. The PubMed database was chosen because it remains the most widely used \nresource for medical literature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical \nliterature.\n14 \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; \nGuideline; Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta -\nAnalysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key PubMed articles  as well as articles from additional sources deemed as \nrelevant to these Guidelines as discussed by the Panel during the Guidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion \nsection. Recommendations for which high -level evidence is lacking are \nbased on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.15 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to \nuse language that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -\nclassist, anti -misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight biased; \nand inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead \nfocusing on organ -specific recommendations. This language is both \nmore accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN \nGuidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or \nsources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how \nsex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably \nor inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex \nassigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:10:03 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nThymomas and Thymic Carcinomas  \n \nMS-3 predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages \nresearchers to collect more specific data in future studies and \norganizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their future \nanalyses.  \nMediastinal Masses \nMasses in the anterior mediastinum can be neoplasms (eg, thymomas, \nlymphomas, thymic carcinomas, thymic carcinoids, thymolipomas, germ \ncell tumors, lung metastases) or non -neoplastic conditions (eg, \nintrathoracic goiter, thymic cysts, lymphangiomas, aortic  aneurysms).16-20 \nAll patients with a mediastinal mass should be evaluated to determine \nthe type of mass and the extent of disease before treatment (THYM -1). It \nis essential to differentiate between thymic malignancies and other \nconditions (eg, lung metastases, lymphoma, goiter, germ cell tumors) \nbefore treatment, because management differs for these conditions.2,21,22 \nHowever, over half of primary cancers in the anterior mediastinum are thymomas.\n4,23 \nAmong the cancers presenting in the mediastinum, there are a range of \nclinical presentations. Unlike thymomas, which are often indolent, \nlymphomas or germ cell tumors may be associated with a rapid onset of symptoms.\n22,24 Lymphomas typically manifest as generalized disease but \ncan also be primary anterior and/or middle mediastinal lesions (ie, \nnodular sclerosing Hodgkin’s disease, non -Hodgkin’s lymphomas [diffuse \nlarge B -cell lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic lymphoma]); patients \ntypically have lymphadenopathy (see the NCCN Guidelines for Hodgkin \nLymphoma and the NCCN Guidelines for B-Cell Lymphomas , available \nat www.NCCN.org ).20,25 Thymic carcinoids are rare neuroendocrine \ntumors that can be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome (see the NCCN Guidelines for Neuroendocrine and \nAdrenal Tumors,  available at www.NCCN.org ).\n26,27 Extragonadal germ \ncell tumors are rare tumors that may also occur in the mediastinum.28,29 Recommended tests for the initial evaluation of  mediastinal masses \ninclude chest CT with contrast and blood chemistry studies ( THYM -1).30-32 \nOn CT, a thymoma is usually a well -defined round or oval mass in the \nthymus without lymph node enlargement.33-35 When assessing a \nmediastinal mass, detection of thymic malignancy versus  thymic cyst or \nthymic hyperplasia can be better discriminated with chest  MRI compared \nto chest CT.36 In patients who cannot tolerate iodinated contrast, chest \nMRI may be substituted .35 FDG -PET/CT is recommended as clinically \nindicated and should encompass the  skull base to mid -thigh. \nAlpha- fetoprotein (AFP) levels and beta- human chorionic gonadotropin \n(beta -hCG) levels may be measured to rule out germ cell tumors.37 \nPulmonary function tests should be performed as clinically appropriate as \npart of the initial evaluation.  \nThymic epithelial tumors are likely if: 1) a well- defined mediastinal mass in \nthe thymic bed that is not continuous with the thyroid gland is present ; 2) \ntumor markers for AFP or beta -hCG are negative; and 3) no other \nadenopathy is present.2  \nThymic Masses \nDiagnosis  \nThe World Health Organization ( WHO ) histologic classification system can \nbe used to distinguish between thymomas, thymic carcinomas, and thymic \ncarcinoids .1,2 The WHO classification is also used to differentiate among \ndifferent histologic types of thymomas (ie, A, AB, B1, B2, B3).38 Thymic \ncarcinomas are categorized by larger subtype groups such as squamous \ncarcinomas, adenocarcinomas, adenosquamous carcinoma, and \ncarcinomas not otherwise specified (NOS).1,2  \nStaging  \nAlthough several staging systems exist, the Masaoka -Koga staging \nsystem has been the most widely accepted system for management and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:10:03 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nThymomas and Thymic Carcinomas  \n \nMS-4 determination of prognosis for both thymomas and thymic \ncarcinomas.5,7,39- 43 Another staging system for thymomas and thymic \ncarcinomas is based on a combined effort by the International Thymic \nMalignancy Interest Group (ITMIG) and International Association for the \nStudy of Lung Cancer (IASLC); this staging system was used as the \nbasis for the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)  TNM system \nfor thymic malignancies (8th edition).44-51 Both the Masaoka and AJCC \nstaging systems are provided in the NCCN Guidelines for Thymomas \nand Thymic Carcinomas  (available at www.NCCN.org ). However, in the \ncurrent Guidelines, treatment recommendations for thymoma and thymic \ncarcinoma refer to Masaoka -Koga staging since much of the available \nclinical evidence was generated using this system.  \nOverview of Treatment  Approaches  \nAll patients with a likely thymic tumor should be treated by a \nmultidisciplinary team with experience in the management of thymomas \nand thymic carcinomas (THYM -2). The team may include radiation \noncologists, thoracic surgeons, medical oncologists,  neurologists,  \npathologists, and diagnostic imaging specialists. Many patients are likely \nto undergo surgery with curative intent, although those with advanced \ndisease may be treated with a multimodal approach that consists of \nsurgery, radiation therapy  (RT), and/o r systemic therapy (THYM -2, \nTHYM -3, and THYM -4).  \nSurgery  \nFor most resectable tumors, complete excision of the lesion by total thymectomy and complete surgical excision of contiguous and \nnoncontiguous disease is the primary oncologic goal (THYM -2).\n5,7,22,52- 55 \nFindings from multiple studies indicate that a complete resection is \nconsidered an important prognostic factor for patients with thymic \nmalignancies.12,56- 60 A board -certified thoracic surgeon with a primary \nfocus on thoracic oncology should be involved in determining whether the mass can be surgically resected. If an R0 resection is deemed \nuncertain, the NCCN Panel recommends preoperative systemic therapy, \nwhich may improve resectability of the tumor (refer to the Systemic \nTherapy section below).61-64 Surgical d ebulking  of tumors is \ndiscouraged.65,66 \nThe resection of adjacent structures, including the pericardium, phrenic nerve, pleura, lung, and even major vascular structures may be required \nfor a complete resection.\n52 Bilateral phrenic nerve resection should be \navoided due to severe respiratory morbidity. During thymectomy, the pleural surfaces should be examined for metastases. To achieve a \ncomplete gross resection, removal of pleural metastases may be \nappropriate in some patients.\n67-69 \nTissue diagnosis with core needle biopsy is recommended for locally \nadvanced or metastatic thymic masses. Open biopsy may be considered \nif core biopsy is neither  feasible nor diagnostic; a transpleural approach \nshould be avoided. The cancer protocol for thymic tumors from the \nCollege of American Pathologists (CAP) may be useful for assessing \nspecimens.70 \nMinimally invasive procedures may be considered for clinical stage I –II \ndisease if all oncologic goals can be met and if performed in specialized \ncenters with surgeons who have  expertise in these techniques.71-83 \nHowever, m inimally invasive procedures are not routinely recommended, \nbecause few long -term studies are available regarding recurrence and \nsurvival.75,84- 86 A systematic review of 1061 patients with thymomas \nreported that 5 -year overall survival after video -assisted thoracoscopic \nsurgery (VATS , 83%–100% vs. open , 79%–98%) and 10 -year \nrecurrence -free survival (VATS , 89%–100% vs. open,  80%–93%) were \nsimilar in patients undergoing VATS compared to open thymectomy, although outcomes may be skewed due to selection bias.\n84 A \nretrospective review in 2835 patients assessed VATS thymectomy PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:10:03 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nThymomas and Thymic Carcinomas  \n \nMS-5 compared with sternotomy in patients with thymomas.87 The 5 -year \noverall survival rate was 97.9% in the VATS group. The overall survival \nrates were not significantly different when comparing the VATS group \nversus the sternotomy group. A meta -analysis also showed that VATS \nwas safe and patients had similar ov erall survival when compared with \nthose receiving open thymectomy.88 There are additional clinical data \navailable regarding the use of other types of minimally invasive \nprocedures, such as robotic -assisted thymectomy (RATS).89  \nRadiation Therapy  \nRT is used for the treatment of thymomas or thymic carcinomas in \nmultiple settings. RT may be given for patients with unresectable \ndisease, for patients with incompletely resected invasive thymoma or thymic carcinoma, or as adjuvant therapy after systemic therapy and \nsurgery for patients with locally advanced disease (THYM -3 and THYM -\n4).\n90 \nIn patients who undergo surgery for thymoma or thymic carcinoma, a \nNational Cancer Data Base study evaluating the impact of postoperative RT in 4006 patients found that postoperative RT was associated with \nlonger survival, particularly among those with Masaoka -Koga stage IIB \nand III disease and among those with positive margins.\n91 Data from \nanother retrospective ITMIG database study based on 1263 patients with \ncompletely resected Masaoka or Masaoka- Koga stage II or III thymoma \ndemonstrated that postoperative RT was associated with improved overall survival.\n92 Patients with completely resected early -stage thymoma \nor thymic carcinoma are at low risk of disease recurrence; some studies \nsuggest that the addition of postoperative RT does  not provide a survival \nbenefit.22,91,93- 96 \nRT (with or without chemotherapy) is also an option for patients with \nunresectable disease or those unable to undergo surgical resection.97-99 \nA prospective phase II study in 56 patients with unresectable thymic epithelial tumors found that  concurrent chemoradiation resulted in an \nobjective response rate of 85.7%.97 A single -center study of patients with \nunresectable thymic carcinoma found that the overall response rate \nfollowing concurrent chemoradiation was 50% (8/16).98 Another single-\ncenter retrospective study evaluating the effects of RT (with or without chemotherapy) in 42 patients with unresectable locally advanced \nthymoma or thymic carcinoma reported that the objective response rates \nwere 43.8% for the RT only group, 50% for the sequential \nchemoradiation group, and 87.5% for the concurrent chemoradiation \ngroup.\n100 \nRecommendations for RT should be made by radiation oncologists with experience in managing thymomas and thymic carcinomas. It is \nimportant for radiation oncologists to communicate with surgeons about \nthe operative findings and determine the target volume a t risk. \nAdditionally, radiation oncologists should consult with the pathologist regarding histology, extent of disease (eg, extracapsular extension), and \nsurgical margins.  \nUse of intensity -modulated RT (IMRT) may decrease the dose to the \nnormal tissues.\n101 If IMRT is used, guidelines from the NCI Advanced \nTechnology Center (ATC) and American Society for Radiation \nOncology/American College of Radiology (ASTRO/ACR) should be followed.\n102- 106 ICRU- 83 (International Commission on Radiation Units \nand Measurements Report 83) recommendations are also a useful \nresource.104,107 Although the normal tissue constraints recommendations \nfor non -small cell lung cancer may be used (see the Principles of \nRadiation Therapy  in the NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung \nCancer , available at www.NCCN.org ), more conservative limits are \nrecommended to minimize the dose volumes to all the normal \nstructures.108,109 Because these patients are younger and have long PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:10:03 PM.

More advanced technologies are \nappropriate when needed to deliver curative RT safely. These \ntechnologies include (but are not limited to) 4D -CT and/or PET/CT \nsimulation, IMRT/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), IGRT, \nmotion management, and proton therapy. In particular, IMRT is preferred \nover 3D -CRT. Compared to IMRT, proton therapy has been shown to \nimprove the dosimetry, allowing better sparing of the norm al tissues with \nfavorable local control and toxicity.110- 112 Incorporating 4D -CT for motion \nassessment and other motion management strategies can facilitate reduction of treatment margins and permit more definitive RT dosing for \ndurable local control in this patient population that tends to have prolonged survival both in the curative and recurrent/metastatic \nsetting.\n101  \nOther Local Therapies  \nThe NCCN Panel states that other local therapies such as image -guided \nthermal ablation may be considered as a treatment option for patients \nwith advanced, metastatic, or recurrent thymic malignancies (THYM -4). \nThere are limited data available (primarily in the setting of thymomas) \nsupporting use of image -guided thermal ablation . One single- center \nretrospective review that assessed the effect of CT- guided percutaneous \ncryotherapy in 19 patients with unresectable thymoma found that the \nmedian progression- free survival was 1 8 months.113 Additionally, no \nsevere complications involving vital organs were reported; pleural effusion was the most common side effect. The efficacy and safety of \nCT-guided percutaneous cryoablation in five patients with recurrent \nthymoma was evaluated in a retrospective study.\n114 Systemic Therapy  \nSystemic therapy is recommended in the NCCN Guidelines in multiple \nsettings for patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma: 1)  \npreoperative therapy for potentially resectable advanced, metastatic, or \nrecurrent disease, 2) treatment for unresectable advanced, metastatic, or \nrecurrent disease, and 3) postoperative therapy for incompletely \nresected disease.  \nFor patients with advanced or metastatic thymoma or thymic carcinoma \nthat is potentially resectable ( ie, if an  R0 resection is uncertain), \npreoperative systemic therapy (typically a combination chemotherapy \nregimen) may be used to reduce tumor size and increase the odds of \nobtaining a complete resection (THYM -4).61-64 A meta -analysis of studies \nthat evaluated the effect of preoperative therapy in patients with \nadvanced thymic epithelial tumors found that the pooled rate of response \nto preoperative therapy was 59%; the 5- year overall survival rate was \n87%.64 Another analysis found that the response rates were 70% to 80% \namong the largest studies evaluating preoperative chemotherapy in \npatients with thymic epithelial tumors; complete resection was reported in \napproximately 50% of those treated with this approach.115,116 \nFor patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic thymoma or \nthymic carcinoma, systemic therapy (with or without RT, depending on \nextent of disease dissemination) is recommended as the main treatment \napproach (THYM -4). The NCCN Panel recommends various  platinum -\nbased combination chemotherapy regimens as first -line systemic \ntreatment options (THYM -C 1 of 3). Other types of systemic therapies \nare reserved for use as subsequent lines of therapy  (THYM -C 2 of 3) . \nSee Systemic Therapy for Thymoma  and Systemic  Therapy for Thymic \nCarcinoma for specific regimens for each tumor type recommended in \nthese NCCN Guidelines.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nThymomas and Thymic Carcinomas  \n \nMS-7 For patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma who have surgery and \nresidual tumor is left behind, postoperative chemotherapy (in \ncombination with RT) is recommended as an option by the Panel  (THYM -\n3). Clinical evidence supporting use of postoperative chemotherapy in \nthis setting is limited due to the lack of randomized trial data. A recent \nsystematic review reported that data on the benefit of postoperative \nchemotherapy in patients with thymic malignancies are mixed and may \nbe confounded by RT, which is frequently used in the postoperative \nsetting in those with incomplete resection.117 \nThymomas \nThymomas typically occur in adults and are rare in children and  \nadolescents.3,22,118 The etiology of thymomas is unknown; alcohol, tobacco \nsmoking, and ionizing radiation do not appear to be risk factors for \nthymomas.3 It has been reported that the incidence of thymomas is higher \namong certain racial and ethnic  subgroups (ie, B lack and Asian \nindividuals) .3,119 \nSome patients diagnosed with thymoma  may be asymptomatic, while \nothers will present with chest pain, cough, or dyspnea. Although \nthymomas can be locally invasive (eg, pleura, lung), they uncommonly \nspread to regional lymph nodes or extrathoracic sites.7,120 -122 \nFor many patients, mortality is not related to thymoma.40 A number of \nautoimmune paraneoplastic diseases, including myasthenia gravis, \nhypogammaglobulinemia, and pure red cell aplasia, are associated with \nthymoma.123 Approximately  one-third of patients with thymomas may have \nmyasthenia gravis, the most common paraneoplastic syndrome \nassociated with thymoma.123- 125 The other paraneoplastic syndromes have \nbeen estimated to occur in <10% of patients with thymoma.125 \nSymptoms suggestive of myasthenia gravis include ptosis, diplopia, \ndrooling, proximal muscle weakness, hoarseness, and/or dyspnea. If patients have myasthenia gravis, they should receive treatment by a \nneurologist with experience in myasthenia gravis before undergoing \nsurgical resection.126- 128 The NCCN Panel recommends that patients with \nthymoma undergo a clinical evaluation for signs of autoimmune \nparaneoplastic disorders (THYM -1). \nSurgically Resectable Thymoma \nCompleteness of resection is an important predictor of outcome for \npatients with thymoma.12,56,57,129 For example, one study found that the \n10-year survival rate of patients with thymoma and complete resection \nwas significantly higher than those with incomplete resection or biopsy \n(76% vs 28%).56 The NCCN Panel recommends surgery (ie, total \nthymectomy and complete excision of tumor) for all patients with \nresectable thymoma who can tolerate the procedure (THYM -2).23,130,131 \nAmong patients with resected thymoma  in one study , the 10 -year \nsurvival rates were approximately 90%, 70%, 55%, and 35% for \nMasaoka stage I, II, III, and IVa disease, respectively.132 \nSurgical biopsy should be avoided if a resectable thymoma is strongly suspected based on clinical and radiologic features (eg, patients have \nmyasthenia gravis and a characteristic mass on CT).\n22 A transpleural \napproach should be avoided during biopsy of a possible thymoma.127,133 \nSmall biopsy sampling (fine- needle or core needle biopsy) does not \nindicate whether invasion is present.134 ITMIG and CAP have established \nprocedures for reporting the surgical and pathologic findings from \nresection specimens.70,135 \nPostoperative treatment recommendations are dependent on disease \nstage and completeness of resection (THYM -3).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nThymomas and Thymic Carcinomas  \n \nMS-8 recurrence risk and the absence of a survival benefit for this group.22,91,93 -\n95 \nThere are conflicting data on whether patients with Masaoka stage II \nthymoma with complete resection will derive benefit from postoperative \nradiation.91,93- 95,136 Higher stage thymomas have a greater risk of disease \nrecurrence and therefore postoperative therapy may be warranted even \nafter complete resection.91,92,94,137,138 The NCCN Panel recommends that \nRT after surgery can be considered if there is no residual tumor (R0) in patients with thymomas who have capsular invasion or Masaoka- Koga \nstage II –IV disease. If surgical margins are positive, the NCCN Panel \nrecommends postoperative RT (if R1 resection) or definitive RT (with or \nwithout chemotherapy; if R2 resection), regardless of thymoma \nstage.\n91,139,140 Decisions about postoperative treatment should be made \nby a multidisciplinary team . \nFor adjuvant RT, a dose of 45 to 50 Gy is recommended for clear or \nclose margins; a dose of 54 Gy is recommended for microscopically \npositive resection margins.90,101,141 However, a total dose of 60 to 70 Gy \n(1.8–2 Gy/fraction per day) is recommended for patients with gross \nresidual disease after surgery.142,143 Extensive elective nodal radiation is \nnot recommended, because thymomas do not typically metastasize to regional lymph nodes.\n7,144  \nAdvanced, Metastatic , or Recurrent Thymoma \nAlthough the majority of patients with thymoma have early -stage disease \nat presentation, there are patients who may be diagnosed with stage III or \nIV disease.5,56 A multidisciplinary discussion is recommended before \ninitiating treatment for advanced or metastatic thymoma as different \ntreatment modalities may be necessary. The NCCN Panel recommends \nthat if the disease is deemed resectable in the advanced or metastatic setting, then surgery may be performed if the patient is able to tolerate the \nprocedure (THYM -4). \nFor patients with thymoma with limited metastases that are potentially \nresectable, the NCCN Panel recommends a multimodal approach with the \ngoal of long- term survival. Resectability is defined as complete (R0) \nresection. This strategy consists of preoperative systemic therapy, \nfollowed by surgery, if deemed resectable based on imaging.145,146 If the \nprimary tumor and any isolated metastases are resected, postoperative \nRT can be considered.62,147 Definitive RT with or without chemotherapy  is \nalso an option, especially  if the disease is deemed unresectable after \nsystemic therapy.97 \nTreatment options for patients with unresectable localized thymomas \nmay include concurrent chemoradiation, systemic therapy, or \nobservation.97,148,149 Local therapies, such as image- guided thermal \nablation or RT, can also be considered .97,99,113,114,149 \nIt is difficult to specify RT dosing regimens for advanced or metastatic \ndisease given the broad range of scenarios that are possible. In general, \na definitive dose of 60 to 70 Gy is recommended for patients with \nunresectable disease.99 Stereotactic  ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also \nknown as stereotactic  body radiation therapy (SBRT) , may be \nappropriate for limited focal metastases, whereas conventional \nfractionation is appropriate for larger metastases. In the palliative setting, \ntypical palliative doses may be used—8 Gy in a single fraction, 20 Gy in \n5 fractions, or 30 Gy in 10 fract ions—depending on the treatment \nobjectives. However, RT dosing can extend up to definitive doses for more durable local control. Highly conformal techniques may be \nappropriate for limited volume metastases, given the relatively long \nnatural history of metastatic thymoma.\n150 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:10:03 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nThymomas and Thymic Carcinomas  \n \nMS-9 If there is evidence of extrathoracic metastases, the NCCN Panel \nrecommends systemic therapy as a means to alleviate symptoms and \nachieve disease control.151-153 Refer to Systemic Therapy for Thymoma  \nbelow for information about specific regimens .  \nThe proportion of patients with early -stage thymoma following complete \nresection who will experience disease recurrence is thought to be low, \nalthough overall thymoma recurrence rates reported in studies vary \nwidely.5,56,154 Treatment recommendations for recurrent thymoma are \nsimilar to those for newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic \nthymoma (THYM -4). As thymoma disease progression is often \nlocoregional  (eg, pleural or pulmonary)  rather than extrathoracic  in nature, \nsurgery or RT may be considered if deemed clinically feasible.13,56,155- 158 \nSystemic Therapy  for Thymoma \nThymomas are considered chemosensitive159; the Guidelines recommend \nseveral chemotherapy regimens for patients with thymoma (THYM -C 1 of \n3). \nThe NCCN Panel has preference stratified the first -line combination \nchemotherapy treatment options for patients with thymomas. The \npreferred first -line regimen is cisplatin/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide \n(CAP) .160 A 50% overall response rate was reported among 29 patients \nwith advanced or recurrent thymoma (and 1 with thymic carcinoma) who \nreceived CAP in a clinical trial; 3 complete and 12 partial responses were \ndocumented.160 Additionally, CAP was associated with a higher objective \nresponse rate than other regimens (44% versus 17%, as exclusive \nsystemic therapy) in patients with advanced thymoma or thymic carcinoma \nbased on data from the RYTHMIC prospective database study.153 \nNon-anthracycline regimens (eg, cisplatin/etoposide [with or without \nifosfamide], carboplatin/paclitaxel) may be useful for patients who cannot \ntolerate the preferred regimen.161- 164 The NCCN Panel has designated the following as “Other Recommended \nRegimens” for patients with thymomas: CAP with prednisone, \ndoxorubicin/cisplatin/vincristine/cyclophosphamide (ADOC), \ncisplatin/etoposide (PE), etoposide/ifosfamide/cisplatin, and \ncarboplati n/paclitaxel.62,161,162,164,165 If patients are unable to tolerate the \nrecommended first -line combination regimens, second- line systemic \ntherapy options described below can be considered. Carboplatin/paclitaxel \nand PE can be used in combination with RT as definitive concurrent \nradiation.  \nMultiple systemic therapy regimens can be considered for treating thymomas in the second -line setting (THYM -C 2 of 3). The NCCN Panel \nhas designated the following as preferred second- line systemic therapy \noptions for the treatment of thymomas: everolimus, gemcitabine (with or \nwithout capecitabine), octreotide (if octreotide scan or dotatate PET/CT \npositive, with or without  prednisone), or pemetrexed.\n166- 170 Other \nrecommended regimens in the second- line setting for thymoma are 5 -FU \nin combination with leucovorin  and single- agent paclitaxel.125,171 Single -\nagent etoposide and single- agent ifosfamide have been deemed by the \nPanel as subsequent therapy regimens that may be useful in certain circumstances.\n172,173 \nTreatment of thymoma with anti -PD-1/PD -L1 therapies  is not \nrecommended due to concerns about immune- related adverse events  in \na population of patients who are already predisposed to paraneoplastic autoimmune disorders .\n174,175 Among the patients with thymoma who \nreceived pembrolizumab in a phase II trial, 71% (5/7) experienced grade 3 or higher immune -related adverse events, including myocarditis.\n176 \nSurveillance: Thymoma \nDespite excellent survival rates, surveillance remains essential for \npatients with thymoma as a wide range of recurrence rates has been PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:10:03 PM.

Patients with thymoma have an increased risk for second \nmalignancies, although no particular screening studies are \nrecommended.3,4,177,178  \nThymic Carcinomas \nThymic carcinomas are rare aggressive tumors that often metastasize to \nregional lymph nodes and extrathoracic sites.5,13,19,179 -181 These tumors \ndiffer  from thymomas because of their malignant histologic features and \ntheir different immunohistochemical and genetic features.1,2,18,182 They \nare predominantly squamous cell carcinomas. However, thymic carcinomas should be differentiated from primary lung malignancies that \nmetastasize to the thymus and may have a similar histologic \nappearance.\n183 \nSymptoms that patients with thymic carcinoma may experience include \ndyspnea, chest pain, superior vena cava syndrome, and others related to mass effect.11 Thymic carcinomas often cause pericardial and pleural \neffusions.  \nThymic carcinomas are associated with a different clinical course from \nthymomas.152,182,184 Unlike patients with thymomas, paraneoplastic \nsyndromes (eg, myasthenia gravis) are rare in patients with thymic \ncarcinoma.9,123,141 If myasthenia gravis is diagnosed, then the diagnosis \nof thymic carcinoma should be reassessed, as the patient may have thymoma.\n9,11 In contrast to thymomas (which mainly occur in adults), \nthymic carcinomas occur over a wide age range (including adolescents).\n9,11  \nSurgically Resectable Thymic Carcinoma  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends surgery for all patients with resectable thymic carcinoma who can tolerate the procedure (THYM -2). Complete \nresection is associated with better survival outcomes than incomplete resection or unresectable thymic carcinoma.\n185,186 The 5-year survival \nrate of patients who have an R0 resection is estimated to be around 60 % \nto 70%.9,10 For completely resected (R0) Masaoka -Koga stage I thymic \ncarcinomas with no capsular invasion, postoperative therapy is not \nrecommended by the NCCN Panel.91,187 \nRT can be used to maximize local control after surgery for higher stage disease or if there are positive margins. A recent retrospective analysis \nevaluated the impact of postoperative RT in 462 patients with thymic \ncarcinoma from the ITMIG/European Society  of Thoracic Surgeons \n(ESTS) database.\n187 Surgery followed by postoperative RT was \nassociated with a significantly higher 5 -year overall survival rate than \nsurgery alone for patients with Masaoka stage III or IV thymic carcinoma, \nregardless of resection margin status.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nThymomas and Thymic Carcinomas  \n \nMS-11 surgery. Use of postoperative RT for stage II thymic carcinoma has \nhistorically been controversial; however, there are some data that \nsuggest RT may have clinical benefit in this setting.10,11,136 \nFor patients with Masaoka -Koga stage II –IV thymic carcinoma and R0 \nmargins after surgery, postoperative RT can be considered. For patients \nwith positive margins after surgical resection (regardless of disease \nstage), postoperative management options recommended by the NCCN \nPanel include RT alone or in combination with \nchemotherapy.9,10,90,136,179,186,188 However, the Panel acknowledges that \nthere is a diversity of opinion on the optimal treatment approach in this \nsetting.146 \nFor adjuvant RT, a dose of 45 to 50 Gy is recommended for clear or \nclose margins; a dose of 54 Gy is recommended for microscopically \npositive resection margins (see Principles of Radiation Therapy  in the full \nGuidelines at www.NCCN.org ).90,99,101,141,142 However, a total dose of 60 \nto 70 Gy (1.8 –2 Gy/fraction per day) is recommended for patients with \ngross residual disease after surgery.99,142,143 \nAdvanced, Metastatic, or  Recurrent Thymic Carcinoma  \nMany patients with thymic carcinoma may have advanced or metastatic \ndisease at presentation. In two separate studies, over three -quarters of \npatients with thymic carcinoma were diagnosed with Masaoka stage III or \nIV disease.9,10 Patients treated for thymic carcinoma are also at significant \nrisk of disease recurrence. In a retrospective analysis of 1042 patients with \nthymic carcinoma from the ITMIG/ESTS database, the cumulative \nincidence of recurrence (CIR) at 5 years was 35%, whi le the 10- year CIR \nwas 40%.10 \nThe paradigm for treating advanced, metastatic, or recurrent thymic \ncarcinoma is like that used for thymomas (THYM -4). The NCCN Panel \nrecommends that patients with advanced, metastatic, or recurrent thymic carcinoma should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team to determine \nthe most appropriate treatment approach . If the disease is resectable and \nthe patient is considered medically operable, then surgery is recommended, followed by postoperative therapy with RT or systemic \ntherapy to reduce risk of recurr ence after surgery. A complete (R0) \nresection is a critical prognostic factor.\n185,186,189 Among patients with thymic \ncarcinoma whose outcomes were analyzed in a retrospective study, the 5 -\nyear survival rate of those with complete resection (66.9%) was higher \nthan those with subtotal resection (30.1%) or whose disease was \nconsidered inoperable ( 24.2%).5 \nFor potentially resectable disease, the NCCN Panel recommends multimodal therapy consisting of neoadjuvant systemic therapy to increase \nthe odds of a complete resection, followed by surgical resection of the \nprimary tumor and any isolated metastases (if resectable), and/or RT (with \nor without chemotherapy).\n9,10,145,146,148 Determination of resectability , \ndefined as a complete (R0) resection, should be made by a thoracic \nsurgeon together with multidisciplinary consultation as needed.  \nTreatment for unresectable disease should be individualized based on \ndisease dissemination and other patient specific factors; recommended \ntreatments in this setting may include concurrent chemoradiation, \nsystemic therapy, observation, or local therapies (THYM -4).97,99,149 A \ndefinitive RT dose of 60 to 70 Gy is recommended for patients with \nunresectable thymic carcinomas.97,99 Local therapy options for focal \nmetastatic lesions can include RT or image -guided thermal \nablation .99,113,114 \nThe spread of thymic carcinoma to distant sites such as brain, liver, \nbone,  and lung has been documented.13,179 If there is evidence of \nextrathoracic metastases in patients with thymic carcinoma, the NCCN \nPanel recommends systemic therapy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nThymomas and Thymic Carcinomas  \n \nMS-12 Systemic Therapy for Thymic Carcinoma \nSeveral types of systemic therapy have clinical activity in thymic \ncarcinomas, although these tumors are considered less chemosensitive \nthan thymomas in general.163 The NCCN Panel consensus is that \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel (with or without ramucirumab) is the preferred first -\nline combination chemotherapy regimen for patients with thymic carcinoma, due to the response rates reported in prospective clinical \ntrials (THYM -C 1 of 3).\n161,190,191 \nA phase II clinical trial reported an overall response rate of 36% among \n39 patients with chemo -naïve advanced thymic carcinoma who received \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel; this included 1 complete response and 13 partial responses.\n190 The median progression -free survival  reported was 7.5 \nmonths and the 2 -year overall survival rate was 71%. A different \nprospective multicenter study reported an overall response rate of 21.7% \namong 23 patients with unresectable thymic carcinoma who were treated \nwith carboplatin/paclitaxel; 5 partial responses were reported.161 The \nmedian overall survival was 20 months.  \nCarboplatin/paclitaxel in combination with the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pathway  inhibitor ramucirumab was recently added \nto the Guidelines as a preferred first -line systemic therapy option based \non data from the single -arm phase II RELEVENT trial in patients with \ntreatment -naïve advanced or metastatic thymic carcinoma.\n191 The \nobjective response rate was 80% based on investigator assessment and \n57.6% based on central review among 35 patients who received \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel/ramucirumab. At a median follow- up of 31.6 \nmonths, the median overall survival was 43.8 months. In the phase II \nS1701 study, 21 patients with unresectable, locally advanced, \nmetastatic, or recurrent thymic carcinoma were randomized to receive \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel with or without ramucirumab.192 The \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel/ramucirumab  group had a higher response rate than the carboplatin/paclitaxel  group ( 88% versus  40%). However, \nclinicians should be aware that patients with untreated brain metastases or major standard contraindications to anti- angiogenics were not \nincluded in the RELEVENT or S1701 study populations. There is no published experience using carboplatin/paclitaxel/ramucirumab as a \npreoperative therapy.  \nThe NCCN Panel has designated the following as “Other Recommended” first-line systemic therapy options for patients with thymic carcinomas : \nCAP with or without prednisone, ADOC, PE, and etoposide/ifosfamide/cisplatin.\n62,160,162,164,165 Although the CAP and ADOC \nregimens have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of thymic carcinomas, they are not preferred due to their toxicity. \nCarboplatin/paclitaxel and PE are regimens that can be used in \ncombination with RT as definitive concurrent chemoradiation. \nFor thymic carcinomas, data on systemic therapy in the second- line \nsetting are limited. T he following are categorized by the NCCN Panel as \n“Preferred” second- line systemic therapy options: gemcitabine with or \nwithout capecitabine, lenvatinib, pembrolizumab, and sunitinib (THYM -C 2 \nof 3).167,193- 196 \nPembrolizumab is active (response rate, 22.5%) as a second -line \ntherapy in patients with thymic carcinomas but is associated with a high rate of severe immune -related adverse events (15%).\n194,197 For example, \ngrade 3– 4 myocarditis has been reported in 5% to 9% of patients with \nthymic carcinomas receiving pembrolizumab, which is higher than the \nrate reported in patients with other malignancies who receive \npembrolizumab.176,194 \nSunitinib is recommended for patients with thymic carcinoma regardless \nof c-Kit mutation status based on data from an open- label phase II \nstudy.195 Out of 23 patients with chemotherapy -refractory thymic PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:10:03 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nThymomas and Thymic Carcinomas  \n \nMS-13 carcinoma, a partial response with sunitinib was observed in 6 \nindividuals (26%). The single- arm phase II STYLE trial also evaluated \nsunitinib as subsequent therapy in patients with advanced or recurrent type B3 thymoma and thymic carcinoma.\n196 The overall response rate \nwas 21.4% among 28 assessable patients with thymic carcinoma in the \nintention -to-treat population; the median overall survival was 27.8 \nmonths.  \nBased on data from the single- arm phase II REMORA trial, the objective \nresponse rate was 38% among 42 patients with metastatic or recurrent thymic carcinoma who received lenvatinib.\n193 The NCCN Panel notes \nthat there is a risk for  intolerable adverse effects with lenvatinib and dose \nreductions may be needed.  \n“Other Recommended” second- line treatment options for thymic \ncarcinoma include avelumab in combination with axitinib, everolimus, 5- FU \nin combination with leucovorin, paclitaxel, and \npemetrexed.125,166,170,171,198,199 Avelumab in combination with axitinib was \nrecently added to the Guidelines as a second -line treatment option for \nthymic carcinoma based on data from the single- arm phase II CAVEATT \ntrial in patients whose advanced thymic carcinoma or type B3 thymoma \nhad progressed after at least one line of platinum -containing \nchemotherapy.199 Out of 32 patients in the study, 27 had thymic \ncarcinoma. Prior use of anti -angiogenics was permitted; 4 patients in the \nstudy previously received ramucirumab. The overall response rate of \nthose treated with avelumab/axitinib was 34%; however, the respons e rate \nof patients who previously received an anti -angiogenic was lower than that \nof those who had not (15% versus 47%).  \nSingle -agent etoposide and single- agent ifosfamide are recommended by \nthe NCCN Panel as second- line treatment options that may be useful in \ncertain circumstances.172,200  Recent data suggest that other systemic regimens may also have activity \nin patients with advanced, metastatic, or recurrent thymic carcinoma.201 \nThe NCCN Panel will continue to evaluate emerging clinical evidence on an annual basis to determine if additional systemic therapy options \nshould be recommended in these Guidelines.  \nSurveillance: Thymic Carcinoma  \nDue to the aggressive nature of the disease, patients with thymic carcinoma are at higher risk of recurrence than those diagnosed with \nthymoma. In a subgroup of patients whose tumor was completely \nresected, one study found that 51.2% of patients with thymi c carcinoma \ndeveloped disease recurrence compared with 7.8% of patients with thymoma.\n5 Additionally, progression to distant sites may occur more \nfrequently in patients with thymic carcinoma than those with thymoma.13  \nA wide range of time to recurrence has been reported. For instance, one \nstudy reported that the time to recurrence ranged from 2 to 108 months, \nwith a median of 11 months, among 40 patients with thymic carcinoma \nwho had undergone surgical resection with cu rative intent.9 \nFor patients with completely resected Masaoka -Koga stage I thymic \ncarcinoma (and no capsular invasion), the NCCN Panel recommends that surveillance imaging should consist of chest CT with contrast every \n6 to 12 months for 2 years, then annually until 5 years. Surveillance for \nall other patients treated for thymic carcinoma should include chest CT \nevery 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 5 years. However, the \nNCCN Panel notes that the duration, frequency, and type of imaging for \nsurveillance for thymic carcinomas ha ve not been evaluated in \nprospective  studies.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nThymomas and Thymic Carcinomas  \n \nMS-14 Summary  \nThymomas and thymic carcinomas are rare thymic  epithelial tumors that \noriginate in the thymus . These  NCCN Guidelines  outline the evaluation , \ntreatment , and surveillance recommendations for patients with  thymomas \nand thymic carcinomas . Involvement of a multidisciplinary team that \nincludes  radiation oncologists, thoracic surgeons, medical oncologists, \npathologists, neurologists, and diagnostic imaging specialists  is critical for \nthe optimal care of patients with thymomas or thymic carcinomas. If \nclinically feasible, surgery is recommended since a complete resection is \nconsidered a key prognostic factor. A multimodal treatment approach that \nincludes surgery, RT, an d/or systemic therapy may be needed for those \nwith poor prognosis and/or advanced disease.
