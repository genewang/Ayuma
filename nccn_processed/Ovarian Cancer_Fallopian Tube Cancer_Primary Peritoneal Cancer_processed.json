HIPEC can also be considered for  \nsuitable stage IV patients (category 2B) who have had a favorable response to neoadjuvant therapy both intraperitoneally and extraperitoneally , \nor in whom stage IV disease sites have completely resolved (eg, resolution of malignant pleural effusion) or are now deemed resectable . Sodium \nthiosulfate may be administered at the start of perfusion, followed by a continuous infusion, to allow for renal protection during HIPEC.\n\u0017Bullet 5 modified: While systemic lymphadenectomy of clinical-negative nodes is not recommended, s uspicious and/or enlarged nodes should be \nresected, if possible. Removal of lymph nodes noted to have potential metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis should be considered, even if not \ncurrently suspicious or enlarged.\nOV-A (4 of 4)\n• Special Circumstances, bullet 1, sub-bullet, second sentence added: Consider endometrial sampling to exclude synchronous primary or hyperplasia. \nOV-B (2 of 3)\n• Less Common Ovarian Cancers (LCOC)\n\u0017Bullet 3, last sentence added: Features favoring primary ovarian carcinoma versus metastasis are: unilateral, \"expansile\" pattern of invasion, complex \npapillary pattern, size >10 cm, smooth external surface, microscopic cystic glands, necrotic luminal debris, mural nodules, and accompanying \nteratoma, adenofibroma, endometriosis, or Brenner tumor. \nOV-B (2 of 3)(continued)\n\u0017Bullet 4 added: Most early stage invasive mucinous ovarian cancers have an expansile pattern of growth characterized by complex glandular , \npapillary and/or cribriform architecture with a labyrinthine or anastomosing pattern and little or no intervening stroma. About 20% have an infiltrative \npattern of destructive invasion of haphazardly arranged and angulated tumor cell nests into a desmoplastic stroma and measuring at least 5 mm in \nlinear extent - and this has been associated with an increased risk of relapse and mortality. \n\u0017Bullet 5 modified: Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas also usually are positive for CK20  and CEA .\n\u0017Bullet 6, second sentence modified: Endometrioid adenocarcinomas are usually positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), P AX8, CA-125 , and estrogen \nreceptors.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

See OV-C (6 of 12) and LCOC-A.\nOV-C (3 of 12)\n• Principles of Maintenance PARP Inhibitor (PARPi) Therapy, bullet 3, sub-bullet 7 added: Current clinical HRD tests are proxy measures of HRD and \nlack accuracy in fully predicting functional HRD. HRD testing is recommended for those patients without germline BRCA1/2 mutations as HRD test \nstatus may provide information on the magnitude of benefit of PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy in these patients. The Panel considers the use of \nPARPi in patients who have HRP tumors, at present, to be of minimal benefit.\nOV-C (4 of 12)\n• Bullet 9 moved from OV-C (9A of 12): Patients who do not respond and progress on two consecutive regimens without evidence of clinical benefits \nhave diminished likelihood of benefitting from additional therapy (Griffiths R W, et al.

In the absence of any suspicious areas, random peritoneal biopsies should be taken from the pelvis, \nparacolic gutters, and undersurfaces of the diaphragm (diaphragm scraping for Papanicolaou stain is an acceptable alternative).\n• BSO and hysterectomy should be performed with every effort to keep an encapsulated mass intact during removal. \n• For selected patients desiring to preserve fertility, USO or BSO with uterine preservation may be considered. Uterine preservation allows for \npotential future assisted reproductive approaches.\n• Omentectomy should be performed.\n• Para-aortic lymph node dissection should be performed by stripping the nodal tissue from the vena cava and the aorta bilaterally to at least \nthe level of the inferior mesenteric artery and preferably to the level of the renal vessels.\n• The preferred method of dissecting pelvic lymph nodes is bilateral removal of lymph nodes overlying and anterolateral to the common iliac \nvessel, overlying and medial to the external iliac vessel, overlying and medial to the hypogastric vessels, and from the obturator fossa at a \nminimum anterior to the obturator nerve.2\nNewly Diagnosed Invasive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Involving the Pelvis and Upper Abdomen (stage >IIB)\nIn general, every effort should be made during a primary cytoreduction procedure to achieve maximum cytoreduction of all abdominal, pelvic, \nand retroperitoneal disease. Residual disease <1 cm defines optimal cytoreduction; however , maximal effort should be made to remove all \ngross disease since this offers superior survival outcomes.3\n• Aspiration of ascites (if present) should be performed for peritoneal cytologic examinations. All involved omentum should be removed. \n• Suspicious and/or enlarged nodes, identified on preoperative imaging or during surgical exploration, should be resected, if possible. \nResection of clinically negative nodes is not required.4\n• Procedures that may be considered for optimal surgical cytoreduction (in all stages) include bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping \nof the diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial cystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, partial \ngastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy.\n• Select patients with low-volume residual disease after surgical cytoreduction for invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal cancer are potential \ncandidates for IP therapy. In these patients, consideration should be given to placement of IP catheter with initial surgery.\nOV-A\n2 OF 4PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY1\n1 Fleming GF, Seidman J, Yemelyanova A, and Lengyl E.

Maximal effort should be made to remove all gross \ndisease in the abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum. Consultation \nwith a gynecologic oncologist is recommended. \n• IDS, including completion hysterectomy and BSO with staging, \nshould be performed after 3–4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy \nfor patients with a response to chemotherapy or stable disease. \nAlternate timing of surgery has not been prospectively evaluated but \nmay be considered based on individual patient-centered factors. \n• HIPEC with cisplatin (100 mg/m2) can be considered at the time of \nIDS for stage III disease. HIPEC can also be considered for suitable \nstage IV patients (category 2B) who have had a favorable response \nto neoadjuvant therapy both intraperitoneally and extraperitoneally, \nor in whom stage IV disease sites have completely resolved (eg, \nresolution of malignant pleural effusion) or are now deemed \nresectable. Sodium thiosulfate may be administered at the start \nof perfusion, followed by a continuous infusion, to allow for renal \nprotection during HIPEC. \n• All peritoneal surfaces should be visualized, and any peritoneal \nsurface or adhesion suspicious for harboring metastasis should be \nselectively excised or biopsied. \n• An omentectomy should be performed. \n• While systematic lymphadenectomy of clinical-negative nodes is \nnot recommended, suspicious and/or enlarged nodes should be \nresected, if possible. \n• Procedures that may be considered for optimal surgical debulking \ninclude bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping of the \ndiaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial \ncystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, \npartial gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy.Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy (RRSO) Protocol\n• For information on when RRSO is indicated, see NCCN Guidelines \nfor Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, \nPancreatic, and Prostate.\n• Perform minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. \n• Survey upper abdomen, bowel surfaces, omentum, appendix (if \npresent), and pelvic organs.\n• Biopsy any abnormal peritoneal findings.\n• Obtain pelvic washing for cytology (50 cc normal saline instilled and \naspirated immediately).\n• Perform total BSO, removing 2 cm of proximal ovarian vasculature/\nIP ligament, all tube up to the cornua, and all peritoneum \nsurrounding the ovaries and tubes, especially peritoneum \nunderlying areas of adhesion between tube and/or ovary and the \npelvic sidewall.5 \n• Engage in minimal instrument handling of the tubes and ovaries to \navoid traumatic exfoliation of cells.5\n• Both ovaries and tubes should be placed in an endobag for retrieval \nfrom the pelvis.\n• Both ovaries and tubes should be processed by sectioning and \nextensively examining the fimbriated end  (SEE-FIM) protocol.6 \n• If occult malignancy or serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) \nis identified, provide referral to a gynecologic oncologist. \n• The prevention benefits of salpingectomy alone are not yet proven. \nIf considered, the fallopian tube from the fimbria to its insertion into \nthe uterus should be removed. In addition, the fallopian tube should \nbe processed and assessed as described above. The concern for \nrisk-reducing salpingectomy alone is that patients are still at risk for \ndeveloping ovarian cancer. In addition, in premenopausal patients, \noophorectomy reduces the risk of developing breast cancer but the \nmagnitude is uncertain.

Consider endometrial sampling to exclude \nsynchronous primary or hyperplasia. Refer to reproductive endocrinologist for evaluation and REI consultation as clinically indicated. \nComprehensive surgical staging should still be performed to rule out occult higher stage disease but may be omitted in pediatric, \nadolescent, and young adult patients with clinically apparent early-stage malignant germ cell tumors based on the pediatric surgical \nliterature.7\n• Mucinous tumors: Primary invasive mucinous tumors of the ovary are uncommon. Thus, the upper and lower GI tract should be carefully \nevaluated to rule out an occult GI primary with ovarian metastases, and an appendectomy need only be performed in patients with a \nsuspected or confirmed mucinous ovarian neoplasm if it appears to be abnormal. A normal appendix does not require surgical resection in \nthis setting. If mucinous histology is confirmed by intraoperative frozen section analysis and there are no suspicious lymph nodes, consider \nomitting lymphadenectomy.\n• Ovarian borderline epithelial (LMP) tumors: Although data show upstaging with lymphadenectomy, other data show that lymphadenectomy \ndoes not affect overall survival. However, omentectomy and multiple biopsies of peritoneum (the most common sites of peritoneal implants) \nmay upstage patients in approximately 30% of cases and may affect prognosis. \n• Secondary cytoreduction: A secondary cytoreduction procedure can be considered in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who develop \na recurrence more than 6 months since completion of initial chemotherapy, have a good performance status, have no ascites, and have \nan isolated focus or limited foci of disease amenable to complete resection. In addition to preoperative imaging, laparoscopy may be used \nto determine if complete resection can be achieved. Secondary cytoreduction can be performed with either open or minimally invasive \napproaches. Consider using validated scoring methods to assess suitability for secondary cytoreduction. \nAncillary Palliative Surgical Procedures8\nThese procedures may be appropriate in select patients:\n• Paracentesis/indwelling peritoneal catheter\n• Thoracentesis/pleurodesis/video-assisted thoracoscopy/indwelling pleural catheter\n• Ureteral stents/nephrostomy\n• Gastrostomy tube/intestinal stents/surgical relief of intestinal obstructionPRINCIPLES OF SURGERY1\n1 Fleming GF, Seidman J, Yemelyanova A, and Lengyl E.

Fine-needle \naspiration (FNA) should be avoided for diagnosis of ovarian cancer \nin patients with presumed early-stage disease to prevent rupturing \nthe cyst and spilling malignant cells into the peritoneal cavity. \nHowever, FNA may be necessary in patients with bulky disease who \nare not candidates for primary debulking.2,3 \n• Both primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers are usually \ndiagnosed postoperatively (if there is no major involvement of the \novary) or preoperatively (if there is a biopsy and the patient has \nalready had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Primary peritoneal \nand fallopian tube cancers are treated in the same manner as \nepithelial ovarian cancer. \n• The CAP protocol is a useful tool for pathology reports.4\nPathologic assessment should include:\n\u0017Elements from CAP protocol4:\n ◊Tumor site(s) (eg, ovary, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneum)\n ◊Tumor size(s) \n ◊Other tissue/organ involvement\n ◊Ovarian/fallopian tumors: surface involvement (present/absent/\ncannot determine), specimen integrity (capsule/serosa intact/\nfractured/fragmented)\n ◊Histologic type and grade\n ◊Extension and/or implants (if sampled/identified)\n ◊Cytology: peritoneal or ascitic fluid or washings/pleural fluid\n ◊Lymph nodes: number and location of nodes examined, size of \nlargest metastatic deposits\n ◊STIC, endometriosis (particularly if in continuity with \nendometrioid or clear cell carcinoma), and/or endosalpingiosis\n ◊Staging information (FIGO and TNM)• Tumor molecular analyses \n\u0017In the upfront setting, choice of somatic testing should, at a \nminimum, optimize identification of molecular alterations that \ncan inform use of interventions that have demonstrated benefit in \nthis setting, including BRCA1/2 , loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or \nhomologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status in the absence \nof a germline BRCA  mutation.\n\u0017In the recurrence setting, tumor molecular analysis is \nrecommended to include, as appropriate, tests to identify potential \nbenefit from targeted therapeutics that have tumor-specific or \ntumor-agnostic benefit including, but not limited to, HER2 status \n(by IHC),  BRCA1/2 , HRD status, microsatellite instability (MSI), \nmismatch repair (MMR), tumor mutational burden (TMB), BRAF, \nFRα (FOLR1) , RET, and NTRK if prior testing did not include \nthese markers. More comprehensive testing may be particularly \nimportant in less common histologies with limited approved \ntherapeutic options. It is recommended that such testing be \nperformed on the most recent available tumor tissue.\n\u0017Molecular analyses may be performed on circulating tumor \nDNA (ctDNA or liquid biopsy) when tissue-based analysis is not \nclinically feasible.\n\u0017Validated molecular testing should be performed in a CLIA-\napproved facility.\nReferences on OV-B (3 of 3)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

The terms \nfor borderline epithelial tumors (also known as LMP tumors or atypical proliferative tumors) have changed over the years.5 The 2023 CAP \nprotocol for ovarian cancer uses borderline and does not use LMP.4 Borderline epithelial tumors are typically serous or mucinous; other \nhistologic subtypes can also occur ( WHO Histologic Classification on OV-E).1,6 The characteristic pathologic hallmark of typical epithelial \novarian cancer is the identification of peritoneal implants, which microscopically and/or macroscopically invade the peritoneum. A borderline \nepithelial tumor may grossly resemble an invasive cancer. However, microscopic evaluation fails to reveal evidence of frank invasion by the \ntumor nodules, although rarely invasive implants (which continue to be consistent with the diagnosis of borderline epithelial lesions) can be \nidentified microscopically by the pathologist.\n• Clear cell carcinomas are high-grade tumors that may arise in endometriosis. Most clear cell carcinomas express napsin A and are negative \nfor WT1 and estrogen receptors.5\n• It is difficult to distinguish based on histology between primary mucinous ovarian carcinomas and GI metastases.7,8,9 PAX8 immunostaining \nis typical of primary ovarian tumors, although the absence of PAX8 does not rule out ovary as the primary site,10 while SATB2 is consistent \nwith colonic origin.11 Features favoring primary ovarian carcinoma versus metastasis are: unilateral, \"expansile\" pattern of invasion, \ncomplex papillary pattern, size >10 cm, smooth external surface, microscopic cystic glands, necrotic luminal debris, mural nodules and \naccompanying teratoma, adenofibroma, endometriosis, or Brenner tumor .12\n• Most early stage invasive mucinous ovarian cancers have an expansile pattern of growth characterized by complex glandular, papillary and/\nor cribriform architecture with a labyrinthine or anastomosing pattern and little or no intervening stroma. About 20% have an infiltrative \npattern of destructive invasion of haphazardly arranged and angulated tumor cell nests into a desmoplastic stroma and measuring at least 5 \nmm in linear extent–and this has been associated with an increased risk of relapse and mortality.13,14\n• Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas also usually are positive for CK20.\n• Endometrioid carcinomas may be associated with endometriosis.10,15 Endometrioid adenocarcinomas are usually positive for cytokeratin 7 \n(CK7), PAX8, and estrogen receptors. Endometrioid tumors are also very similar in appearance to sex cord-stromal tumors.5\n• Most pathologists now consider MMMTs to be a variant of poorly differentiated epithelial ovarian cancer (metaplastic carcinoma).16\nSpecial Circumstances\n• Other cancers17,18 that can commonly involve the adnexa include:\n\u0017Uterine \n\u0017Cervical \n\u0017GI (small and large bowel, pancreatic)\n\u0017Lymphoma\n• For risk-reducing surgery, pathologic assessment should include the following:\n\u0017Fallopian tubes should be processed by SEE-FIM of the tubes and then assessed to determine whether any evidence of cancer is present.4\n\u0017The ovaries should also be carefully sectioned, processed, and assessed.4 The 2023 CAP protocol describes the process for sectioning the \nfallopian tubes and ovaries.4\n• Patients who have equivocal pathologic findings or who are referred to NCCN Member Institutions after having a previous diagnosis of \novarian cancer should have their pathology reviewed by pathologists at NCCN Member Institutions.\nOV-B\n2 OF 3PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGY\nReferences on OV-B (3 of 3)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Appropriate blood chemistry tests should \nbe monitored. Appropriate dose reductions and modifications \nof chemotherapy should be performed depending on toxicities \nexperienced and goals of therapy. \n• After completion of chemotherapy, patients should be assessed for \nresponse during and following treatment and monitored for any long-\nterm complications.\n• Chemosensitivity/resistance and/or other biomarker assays are being \nused at some NCCN Member Institutions for decisions related to \nfuture chemotherapy in situations where there are multiple equivalent \nchemotherapy options available. The current level of evidence is not \nsufficient to supplant standard-of-care chemotherapy (category 3).\n• An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any \nrecommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines.Definitions Used in the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer\n• Adjuvant therapy: Drugs, radiation, or other forms of supplemental \ntreatment following cancer surgery intended to decrease the risk of \ndisease recurrence or to primarily treat residual disease, whether gross \nor microscopic, following surgical cytoreduction.\n• Neoadjuvant therapy: Drugs, radiation, or other forms of treatment \ngiven prior to cancer surgery intended to reduce tumor burden in \npreparation for surgery.\n• Recurrence therapy: Drugs, radiation, or other forms of treatment used \nto treat recurrent cancer, control symptoms, or increase length and/\nor quality of life at the time of clinical, biochemical, or radiographic \nevidence of recurrent cancer following the initial treatment.\nFor Patients with Newly Diagnosed Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary \nPeritoneal Cancer:\n• If they are eligible for chemotherapy, patients should be informed about \nthe different primary therapy options that are available—such as IV \nchemotherapy, a combination of IP and IV chemotherapy, or a clinical \ntrial—so they can decide which is the most appropriate option.\n• Prior to the administration of the combined IP and IV regimen, patients \nmust be apprised of the increased toxicities with the combined \nregimen when compared to using IV chemotherapy alone (increased \nmyelosuppression, renal toxicities, abdominal pain, neuropathy, GI \ntoxicities, metabolic toxicities, and hepatic toxicities).\n• Patients considered for the IP cisplatin and IP/IV paclitaxel regimen \nshould have normal renal function prior to starting, a medically \nappropriate performance status based on the future toxicities of \nthe IP/IV regimen, and no prior evidence of medical problems that \ncould significantly worsen during chemotherapy (eg, pre-existing \nneuropathy). \n• Prior to receiving and after receiving each cycle of IP cisplatin, \nadequate amounts of IV fluids need to be administered in order to \nprevent renal toxicity. After each cycle has been completed, patients \nneed to be monitored carefully for myelosuppression, dehydration, \nelectrolyte loss, end-organ toxicities (such as renal and hepatic \ndamage), and all other toxicities. Patients often require IV fluids \npostchemotherapy in the outpatient setting to prevent or help treat \ndehydration. \n• Refer to the original references (Discussion) for full toxicity data, doses, \nschedule, and dose modifications.\nOV-C\n1 OF 12PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY\nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Neoadjuvant therapy does not apply to LMP and other noninvasive cancers. See OV-C (6 of 12) and LCOC-A.\n• Bevacizumab-containing regimens should be used with caution before surgery due to potential interference with postoperative healing. If \nbevacizumab is being used as part of a neoadjuvant regimen, bevacizumab should be withheld from therapy for 4–6 weeks prior to surgery . \n• After neoadjuvant therapy and surgery, any of the adjuvant therapy options for high-grade serous carcinoma (IV or IP/IV) and respective \nLCOCs can be considered. Neoadjuvant therapy does not apply to LMP and other noninvasive cancers. See OV-C (6 of 12) and LCOC-A.\n• There are limited data for the use of IP chemotherapy regimens after neoadjuvant therapy and surgery. The following is an additional IP \noption after surgery: paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 6 IP on Day 1, and paclitaxel 60 mg/m2 IP on \nDay 8.a \n• A minimum of 6 cycles of treatment is recommended, including at least 3 cycles of adjuvant therapy after surgery.

If appropriate, palliative care should also be \ndiscussed as a possible treatment choice. See NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care.\n• Tumor molecular testing is recommended if not previously done for persistent/recurrent disease. See Principles of Pathology (OV-B).\n• Because of prior platinum exposure, myelosuppression occurs more frequently with any myelotoxic agent given in the recurrent setting.\n• With repeat use of either carboplatin and/or cisplatin, patients are at an increased risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction (also \ncalled an allergic reaction) that could be life-threatening. Thus, patients should be counseled about the risk that a hypersensitivity reaction \nmay occur, educated about the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, treated by medical staff who know how to manage \nhypersensitivity reactions, and treated in a medical setting where appropriate medical equipment is available in case of an allergic reaction. \nSee Management of Drug Reactions (OV-D).\n• Before any chemotherapy drug is given in the recurrent setting, the clinician should be familiar with the drug’s metabolism (ie, renal, \nhepatic) and should make certain that the patient is an appropriate candidate for the drug (eg, that the patient has adequate renal or hepatic \nfunction). \n• Clinicians should be familiar with toxicity management and appropriate dose reduction.\n• The schedule, toxicity, and potential benefits of any treatment should be thoroughly discussed with the patient and caregivers. Patient \neducation should also include a discussion of precautions and measures to reduce the severity and duration of complications.\n• Patients who do not respond and progress on two consecutive regimens without evidence of clinical benefits have diminished likelihood of \nbenefitting from additional therapy (Griffiths RW, et al. Int J Gynecol Cancer 2011;21:58-65).

These \ntend to occur during the first few cycles of treatment (although \nthey can be seen during any infusion regardless of how many \nprevious cycles were administered).\n\u0017Adverse reactions associated with platinum drugs (ie, carboplatin, \ncisplatin), a true allergy, tend to occur following re-exposure to \nthe inciting drug or less commonly at the completion of initial \nchemotherapy (ie, cycle 6 of a planned 6 treatments).3 • Preparation for a possible drug reaction \n\u0017Patients and their families should be counseled about the \npossibility of a drug reaction and the signs and symptoms of \none. Patients should be told to report any signs and symptoms \nof a drug reaction, especially after they have left the clinic (ie, \ndelayed rash). \n\u0017Clinicians and nursing staff should be prepared for the \npossibility of a drug reaction every time a patient is infused \nwith a drug. Standing orders should be written for immediate \nintervention in case a severe drug reaction occurs and the \ntreatment area should have appropriate medical equipment in \ncase of a life-threatening reaction.5 \n\u0017Epinephrine (intramuscular [IM] 0.3 mL of 1 mg/mL solution/\nEpipen) should be used for any patient experiencing hypotension \n(systolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg) with or without other \nsymptoms of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction during or \nshortly after any chemotherapy drug treatment. In the setting of \nacute cardiopulmonary arrest, standard resuscitation (advanced \ncardiovascular life support [ACLS]) procedures should be \nfollowed.\n• Desensitization refers to a process of rendering the patient less \nlikely to react in response to an allergen and can be considered an \noption for patients who have had drug reactions.1,7-10 \n• If a patient has previously had a very severe life-threatening \nreaction, the implicated drug should not be used again unless \nunder guidance of an allergist or specialist with desensitization \nexperience.\nOV-D\n1 OF 7MANAGEMENT OF DRUG REACTIONS\nReferences on OV-D, 3 of 7Continued on OV-D, 2 of 7PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

However, patients who have had mild reactions \nto carboplatin, cisplatin, or oxaliplatin may develop \nmore serious reactions even when the platinum drug is \nslowly infused; therefore, consider consultation with an \nallergist.11\n• Infusion reactions are more common with paclitaxel \n(27% of patients); however, mild reactions can occur with \nliposomal doxorubicin.11 \n• If an infusion reaction has previously occurred in \nresponse to a taxane:\n\u0017For mild infusion reactions (eg, flushing, rash, chills), \npatients may be rechallenged with the taxane if: \n1)  the patient, physician, and nursing staff are all \ncomfortable with this plan;\n2) the patient has been counseled appropriately; and \n3) emergency equipment is available in the clinic area. \n\u0017Typically the taxane infusion can be restarted at a much \nslower rate, and the rate can be slowly increased as \ntolerated as per the treating clinician’s judgment.7,12 \nNote that this slow infusion is different from \ndesensitization. \n\u0017Many institutions have nursing policies that stipulate \nhow to reinfuse the drug if the patient has had a prior \ninfusion reaction.Allergic Reactions (ie, True Drug Allergies)\n• Symptoms include: rash, edema, shortness of breath (bronchospasm), \nsyncope or pre-syncope, chest pain, tachycardia, hives/itching, changes in \nblood pressure, nausea, vomiting, chills, changes in bowel function, and \noccasionally feeling of impending doom.\n• Symptoms may continue to persist after stopping infusion and/or after \ntreatment interventions. \n• Allergic reactions are more common with platinum drugs such as carboplatin \n(16% of patients), cisplatin, and oxaliplatin.12 Mild reactions can occur with \nplatinum agents.12\n• Patients who are at higher risk of developing a hypersensitivity (allergic) \nreaction include those in the following settings: \n\u0017Re-introduction of the drug after a period of no exposure and following \nmultiple cycles of the drug during the first and subsequent exposures\n\u0017IV administration of the drug rather than oral or IP administration\n\u0017Those with allergies to other drugs\n\u0017Those who have previously had a reaction\n• If an allergic reaction has previously occurred:\n\u0017Consider consultation with an allergist (or qualified medical or gynecologic \noncologist) and skin testing for patients who have experienced a platinum \nreaction (eg, carboplatin-hypersensitivity reaction).12-14\n\u0017Patients who have had mild reactions may develop more serious reactions \neven when the platinum drug is slowly infused.12\n\u0017For more severe or life-threatening reactions—such as those involving \nblood pressure changes, dyspnea, tachycardia, widespread urticaria, \nanaphylaxis, or hypoxia—the implicated drug should not be used again \nunless under guidance of a specialist with desensitization experience.\n\u0017If it is appropriate to give the drug again, patients should be desensitized \nprior to resuming chemotherapy even if the symptoms have resolved. \nPatients must be desensitized with each infusion if they previously had a \ndrug reaction.1,7-10\nOV-D\n2 OF 7MANAGEMENT OF DRUG REACTIONS\nReferences on OV-D, 3 of 7PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nMS-2 Overview  \nOvarian neoplasms consist of several histopathologic entities , with  \nepithelial ovarian cancer accounting for the majority of malignant ovarian \nneoplasms (about 90%) .1-4 Epithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause \nof death from gynecologic cancer in the United States and is the country’s \nfifth most common cause of cancer mortality in females .5 In 202 2 it is \nestimated that 19,880  new diagnoses and 12,810  deaths from this \nmalignancy  will occur in the United States.5 Five-year survival is about \n49%, although survival is longer for select patients with early stage \ndisease and certain histological subtypes.5-8 Approximately  half of patients \npresent with distant disease ; however,  certain uncommon subtypes , such \nas clear cell and endometrioid cancer,  are more likely to be diagnosed at \nearlier stages.5-7,9  \nThese NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer discuss cancers originating in \nthe ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum and include recommendations for \nepithelial subtypes, including serous, endometrioid, carcinosarcoma \n(malignant mixed Müllerian tumors [MMMTs] of the ovary), clear ce ll, \nmucinous, and borderline epithelial tumors (also known as low malignant \npotential [LMP] tumors). The recommendations are primarily based on \ndata from patients with the most common subtypes —high-grade serous \nand grade 2  and 3 endom etrioid  carcinoma. Also included in the \nguidelines are recommendations for less common ovarian cancers \n(LCOC ), specifically carcinosarcoma, clear cell carcinoma, mucinous \ncarcinoma, low -grade serous  carcinoma , grade 1 endometrioid  carcinoma , \nborderline epithelial  tumors, and  non-epithelial subtypes including \nmalignant sex cord -stromal tumors  and germ cell tumors.   \nBy definition, the NCCN Guidelines cannot incorporate all possible clinical \nvariations and are not intended to replace good clinical judgment or \nindividualization of treatments. Exceptions to the rule were discussed \namong panel members during the process o f developing these guidelines. A 5% rule (omitting clinical scenarios that comprise less than 5% of all \ncases) was used to eliminate uncommon clinical occurrences or conditions \nfrom these guidelines.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nMS-3 Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update Methodology  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian \nCancer, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to \nobtain key literature in ovarian cancer published since the previous \nGuidelines update, using the following search terms: ((ovarian OR \nfallopian OR (primary and peritoneal) OR ovary OR (sex and cord -stromal) \nor mullerian) A ND (carcinoma OR cancer OR malignancy OR \nmalignancies OR lesion OR tumor).  The PubMed database was chosen \nbecause it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature \nand indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.10 The search results \nwere narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. \nArticles were also excluded if they: 1) involved investigational agents that \nhave not yet received FDA approval; 2) did not pertain to the disease site; \n3) were clinical trial protocols; or 4) were reviews that were not systematic \nreviews. The search results were further narrowed by selecting \npublications reporting clinical data, meta -analyses and systematic reviews \nof clinical studies, and treatment guidelines developed by other \norganizations.  \nThe potential relevance of the PubMed search results was examined by \nthe oncology scientist and panel chair s, and a list of selected articles was \nsent to the panel for their review and discussion at the panel meeting. The \npanel also reviewed and discussed published materials referenced in \nInstitutional Review Comments or provided with Submission Requests. \nThe data from key PubMed articles, as well as ar ticles from additional \nsources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines and discussed by the \npanel, have bee n included in this version of the Discussion section (eg, \ne-publications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). Recommendations for \nwhich high -level evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of \nlower -level evidence and expert opinion. The complete d etails of the \nDevelopment and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are at www.NCCN.org . Risk Factors for Ovarian Cancer  \nReproductive Risk Factors  \nEpidemiologic studies have identified risk factors in the etiology of ovarian \ncancer.4,11,12 A 30% to 60% decreased risk for cancer is associated with 1  \nor more  pregnanc ies/birth s, the use of oral contraceptives, and/or \nbreastfeeding.11,13 -26 Conversely, nulliparity confers an increased risk for \novarian cancer. Data suggest that postmenopausal hormone therapy and \npelvic inflammatory disease may increase the risk for ovarian cancer,11,27 -\n37 although results vary across studies.38-41 The risk for ovarian borderline \nepithelial tumors (also known as LMP tumors) may be increased after \novarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization.32,42 -46 \nObesity, Smoking, and Lifestyle and Environmental Risk Factors  \nStudies evaluating obesity as a risk factor for ovarian cancer have yielded \ninconsistent results,47 which may be due to associations between obesity \nand other ovarian cancer risk factors (eg, parity, oral contraceptive use, \nmenopausal status).23,48,49 The risk associated with obesity may differ \nacross ovarian cancer subtypes, and depend on the timing and reason for \nweight gain.39,48 -50 Smoking is associated with an increased risk for \nmucinous carcinomas but a decreased risk for clear cell carcinomas.11,51 -55 \nEnvironmental factors have been investigated, such as talc,56-66 but so far \nthey have not been conclusively associated with the development of this \nneoplasm.  \nFamily History and Genetic Risk Factors  \nFamily history (primarily patients having two or more first -degree relatives \nwith ovarian cancer) —including linkage with BRCA1  and BRCA2  \ngenotypes (hereditary breast and ovarian cancer [HBOC] syndrome) or \nfamilies affected by Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal \ncancer [HNPCC] syndrome) —is associated with increased risk of ovarian \ncancer, particularly early -onset disease.11,67 -88 In addition to mutations in PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nMS-4 BRCA1/2  and the genes associated with Lynch syndrome ( eg, MLH1 , \nMSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 ),74,86,87,89 -92 germline mutations in a variety of other \ngenes have been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer (eg, \nATM , BRIP1 , NBN , PALB2 , STK11 , RAD51C , RAD51D ).73,74,89,92 -105 \nPatients with mutations in BRCA1/2  account for only approximately 15% \n(range, 7 %–21%) of those  who have ovarian cancer.73,89,95,106 -114 Studies \ntesting large panels of genes have found that 3 % to 8% of patients with \novarian cancer carry mutations in genes other than BRCA1  and BRCA2  \nknown to be associated with ovarian cancer susceptibility.73,74,95,108,112,113 \nRisk -Reducing Surgery for High -Risk Patients  \nIn those  at high risk (with either BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutations), \nrisk-reducing bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy (BSO) is associated with a \nreduced risk for breast, ovarian, fallopian  tube, and primary peritoneal \ncancers.115-119 Prospective studies have shown that among patients at high \nrisk due to BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutation, occult ovarian, fallopian  tube, or \nprimary peritoneal cancer is found in up to 5% of patients undergoing risk -\nreducing salpingo -oophorectomy (RRSO),118,120 -125 enabling them to be \ndiagnosed at an earlier and possibly more treatable stage. However, there \nis a residual risk for primary peritoneal cancer after risk -reducing BSO in \nindividuals  at high risk for ovarian cancer.118,121,123,126,127 128Additional \nconsiderations and recommended procedures for risk reduction surgery \nare described in the Risk-Reducing Salpingo -Oophorectomy (RRSO) \nProtocol  section below.  \nSerous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma (STIC)  \nIt is now generally accepted that the fallopian  tube is the origin of many \nserous ovarian and primary peritoneal cancers, and that serous \nintraepithelial carcinoma of the fallopian  tube (also known as serous tubal \nintraepithelial carcinoma [STIC]) is a precursor of most high-grade serous \novarian or peritoneal cancer.1,127,129 -139 A referral to a gynecologic \noncologist/comprehensive cancer center is recommended for management of occult STIC. At present, management options consist of: \n1) observation alone with or without C A-125 testing  when no evidence of \ninvasive cancer is noted ; and 2) surgical staging  with observation or \nchemotherapy based on NCCN Guidelines  if invasive cancer is noted.  For \nthose  without prior genetic counseling and/or testing, discovery of a STIC \nshould prompt a genetics evaluation. Nonetheless, i t is not clear whether \nsurgical staging and/or adjuvant chemotherapy is beneficial for those  with \nSTIC.  An ongoing clinical trial (NCT04251052) sponsored by the National \nCancer Institute (NCI)  will prospectively track the incidence of STIC \nlesions as well as outcomes in those  with pathogenic variants of BRCA1  \nthat elected to undergo RRSO  or risk -reducing salpingectomy with \npossible delayed oophorectomy.140 \nScreening  \nSymptoms of Ovarian Cancer  \nBecause of the location of the ovaries and the biology of most epithelial \ncancers, it has been difficult to diagnose ovarian cancer at an earlier, more \ncurable stage. Evaluations of patients with newly diagnosed ovarian \ncancer have resulted in consensus gu idelines for ovarian cancer \nsymptoms,139,141 -143 which may enable earlier identification of patients who \nmay be at an increased risk of having developed early -stage ovarian \ncancer.144,145 Symptoms suggestive of ovarian cancer include: bloating, \npelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, and urinary \nsymptoms (urgency or frequency), especially if these symptoms are new \nand frequent (>12 d/mo),144 and cannot be attributed to any known \n(previously identified) malignancy or cause. Physicians evaluating those  \nwith this constellation of symptoms must be cognizant of the possibility \nthat ovarian pathology may be causing these symptoms.146,147 Studies \ntesting proposed symptom indices have found that these are not as \nsensitive or specific as necessary, especially in those with early -stage \ndisease.145,148 -154  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nMS-5 Screening with Ultrasound and/or Serum CA -125 \nThe literature does not support routine screening for ovarian cancer in the \n(asymptomatic) general population,155,156 and routine screening is not \ncurrently recommended by any professional society.146,147,155,157 -164 Several \nlarge prospective randomized trials have evaluated screening for ovarian \ncancer with serum CA -125 and/or ultrasound (US) compared with “usual \ncare” or no screening in the general population of postmenopausal \nindividuals  with intact ovaries ( Table 1 ). Primary analysis results and meta \nanalyses of data from these randomized studies suggest that screening \nmay increase the likelihood of diagnosis at an early disease stage,165-167 \nand may slightly lengthen survival in those diagnosed with ovarian \ncancer.156,166,168 However, screening did not improve ovarian cancer -\nrelated mortality overall.156,165,167,168 U.S. Preventative Services Task Force \nassessment of these randomized trials concluded that in average -risk \nindividuals  aged 45 years  or older , ovarian cancer -related mortality was \nnot improved by annual screening with transvaginal US (TVUS ) alone, CA -\n125 alone, or both.159 Results from these randomized prospective trials \nand from single -arm prospective trials suggest that the positive predictive \nvalue was low (<50%) for the screening methods tested (serum CA -125 and/or US).169-172 Harms of screening included false positives in up to 44% \nof patients (over the course of multiple rounds of screening), which may \nhave caused  unnecessary stress and resulted in unnecessary surgery in \nup to 3.2%, with complications in up to 15% of false -positive \nsurgeries.155,159,165,173 -175 A number of analyses have aimed to determine \nmethods to improve the utility of US - and CA -125 based screening in \npostmenopausal individuals  at average risk.166,172,176 -188 Several have \nfound that compared with a single CA -125 serum concentration threshold \nfor further testing/surgery, using the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm \n(ROCA) to determine CA -125–based thresholds may enable earlier \ndetection of ovarian cancer and improve the sensitivity of CA -125–based \nscreening.166,176,178 In the UKCTOC S trial, ROCA was used prospectively \nin the multimodality screening arm as criteria for further testing (CA -125 at \n3 months and/or TVUS), but nonetheless ovarian cancer -related mortality \nwas not significantly different from the unscreened population.165 Data \nfrom large population -based studies have shown that a variety of other \nconditions not related to cancer may impact CA -125 levels,189 which may \nexplain the poor positive predictive value of CA -125 screening observed in \nprospective trials.\n  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-7 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nScreening with Other Biomarker Tests  \nIn addition to CA -125, there are  a number of biomarkers that have been \nexplored as possible screening tools for early detection of ovarian \ncancer.181,196 -209 Data for most of these proposed biomarkers is limited to \nretrospective analyses comparing biomarker levels in patients with known \novarian cancer versus healthy controls. Very few biomarkers have been \ntested prospectively to determine whether they can dete ct ovarian cancer \nor predict development of ovarian cancer in those  who have no other signs \nor symptoms of cancer. Data show that several markers (including \nCA-125, HE4, mesothelin, B7 -H4, decoy receptor 3 [DcR3], and \nspondin -2) do not increase early enoug h to be useful in detecting \nearly -stage ovarian cancer.182,210,211 \nThere are a number of biomarker tests and prediction algorithms (based \non a variety factors, such as symptoms, imaging results, biomarkers, and \npatient characteristics) that have been developed for assessing the \nlikelihood of malignancy among patients who have an adnexal mass (and \nhave not yet had surgery). It is important to note that these tests are for \npreoperative assessment only, and none is suitable for ovarian cancer \nscreening prior to detection of an adnexal mass; they are also not for use \nas stand -alone diagnostic tests. For example, the OVA1 test is a \nmultivariate index assay (MIA) that uses five markers (including \ntransthyretin, apolipoprotein A1, transferrin, beta -2 microglobulin, and \nCA-125) in preoperative serum to assess the likelihood of malignancy in \npatients with an adnexal mass for which surgery is planned, with the aim \nof helping communit y practitioners determine which patients to refer to a \ngynecologic oncologist for evaluation and surgery.212-216 The Society of \nGynecologic Oncology (SGO) and the FDA have stated that the OVA1 test \nshould not be used as a screening tool to detect ovarian cancer in patients \nwithout any other signs of cancer, or as a stand -alone diagnostic \ntool.146,161,217 Moreover, based on data documenting an increased survival, \nthe NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends that all patients with suspected ovarian malignancies (especially those with an adnexal mass) should \nundergo evaluation by an experienced gynecologic oncologist prior to \nsurgery.147,218 -221 For discussion of preoperative tests recommended by \nNCCN for patients with an undiagnosed adnexal mass, see the section \nbelow entitled Recommended Workup, Patients Presenting with Clinical  \nSymptoms /Signs . \nRisk -Reducing Salpingo Ooph orectomy (RRSO) Protocol  \nThe RRSO protocol is recommended for patients at risk for HBOC and is \ndescribed in detail in the algorithm (see the Principles of Surgery  in the \nalgorithm ). Selection of patients appropriate for this procedure is described \nin the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: \nBreast , Ovarian , and Pancreatic (available at www.NCCN.org ). In addition \nto reducing the risk of breast, ovarian, fallopian  tube, and primary \nperitoneal cancers in patients at high risk,115-119 RRSO can also result in \nearly diagnosis of gynecologic cancer. Occult ovarian, fallopian  tube, and \nprimary peritoneal cancer is sometimes found by RRSO (in 3.5 %–4.6% of \npatients with BRCA1/2  mutations),118,120 -125 and in some cases only \ndetected by pathologic examination of specimens.120,222 -227 This \nemphasizes the need for well -tested protocols that include careful \npathologic review of the ovaries and tubes.123,128  \nThis protocol recommends minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. This \nprocedure should include a survey of the upper abdomen, bowel surface s, \nomentum, appendix (if present) , and pelvic organs. Any abnormal \nperitoneal findings should be biopsied. Pelvic washing for cytology should \nbe obtained, using approximately 55 cc normal saline instilled and \naspirated immediately. The procedure should include total BSO, removing \n2 cm of proximal ovarian vasculature or IP ligament, all of the fallopian  \ntube up to the co rnua, and all of the peritoneum surrounding the ovaries \nand fallopian  tubes, especially the peritoneum underlying areas of \nadhesion between the fallopian  tube and/or ovary and the pelvic PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Complete evaluation of the fallopian  tubes is important, as \nprospective studies have found that roughly a half of the cases of occult \ndisease identified by RRSO in BRCA1/2  mutation carriers were tubal \nneoplasms.118,120,122 -124 For pathologic assessment, fallopian  tubes should \nbe processed by sectioning and extensively examining the fimbriated end \n(SEE -Fim) of the tubes and then assessed to determine whether any \nevidence of cancer is present.128,228,229 The ovaries should also be \ncarefully sectioned, processed, and assessed.128 The CAP protocol \ndescribe s the process for sectioning the fallopian  tubes and ovaries.230-232 \nIf occult malignancy or STIC is identified, the patient should be referred to \na gynecologic oncologist.  \nNote that it is controversial whether a hysterectomy should also be done in \npatients undergoing RRSO. Some patients with elevated risk of ovarian \ncancer due to genetic risk factors or family history may also have elevated \nrisk of endometrial cancer.233-237 The relationship between BRCA  \nmutations and uterine cancer has been evaluated in multiple studies , with \nsome studies showing that BRCA  mutation carriers are at higher risk of \nuterine/endometrial cancer compared with the general population or \ncompared with those without BRCA  mutations ;238-242 other studies showing \nno linkage243,244 or a lower risk of uterine cancer among BRCA  mutation \ncarriers ;245 and some studies suggest ing that increased risk is largely due \nto tamoxifen exposure.240,246 In a few studies of BRCA  mutation carriers \nwho underwent RRSO without hysterectomy and had no evidence of \ndisease at the time of surgery, the post -surgery incidence of uterine \ncancer was higher compared with the general population,247-249 but in other \nstudies it was not elevated.250 Several studies found that BRCA1  \nmutations were linked to endometrial or uterine cancer, but BRCA2  \nmutations either were not associated with increased risk or were not analyzed .240-242,247 -249 However, there are also studies showing no \nsignificant association between uterine cancer and BRCA1  \nmutations ,243,245 so further research on this topic is needed.  \nCertain pathogenic variants associated with Lynch syndrome have been \nlinked to increased risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer s, and \nassociated with cases where both types of cancer develop in an individual \npatient or family.83,86 -88,90,251 -255 Certain reproductive factors, such as \ninfertility, parity, and exposure to contraceptives, fertility drugs, and \npostmenopausal hormone therapy, are known to increase or decrease the \nrisk of both ovarian and endometrial cancers.15,16,19,30,45,256 -258 Among \npatients with who underwent RRSO due to BRCA  mutation, diagnosis of \nbreast cancer, or family history of breast/ovarian cancer, and elected to \nhave hysterectomy at the time of RRSO, several studies reported finding \noccult uterine disease, although the frequency varied.120,259 -262 Based on \nstudies specifically focusing on patients with mutations associated with \nLynch syndrome, however, discovery of occult endometrial cancer may be \nas frequent as occult ovarian/ fallopian  tube lesions, and the incidence of \nendometrial cancer may be significantly reduced by prophylactic \nhysterectomy.263,264 One large population -based study of individuals  with \npremenopausal primary breast cancer showed that prophylactic BSO plus \nhysterectomy reduced the risk of new primary breast cancer and improved \nbreast -cancer associated mortality; neither procedure alone significantly \nmodified these risks, and the effec t was not seen in those  with \npostmenopausal breast cancer.265 See the NCCN Guidelines for \nGenetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast , Ovarian , and Pancreatic  \n(available at www.NCCN.org ) for further discussion of selection of patients \nwho may benefit from hysterectomy at the time of RRSO.   \nThe prevention benefits of salpingectomy alone are not yet proven.266-276 If \nsalpingectomy alone is considered, the fallopian  tube from the fimbria to \nits insertion into the uterus should be removed; the fallopian  tubes should PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Some \npresent with clinical signs and/or symptoms, which upon imaging reveal a \npelvic mass and potentially evidence of metastasis. For other patients, \novarian cancer is an incidental findin g during a surgery or other procedure. \nRecommended workup for each of these presentations is described \nbelow.  Patients Presenting with Clinical Symptoms /Signs  \nClinical symptoms that warrant further workup for possible ovarian cancer \ninclude suspicious/palpable pelvic mass found on an abdominal/pelvic \nexam, ascites, abdominal distention, and/or symptoms (ie, bloating, \npelvic/abdominal pain, difficulty eating for feeling full quickly, and urinary \nsymptoms, such as increased urgency or frequency).144 Clinical signs \nmight include abdominal distension/ascites and a mass noted on \nabdominal/pelvic examination . Further workup for these patients should \ninclude imaging, laboratory studies, evaluation of nutritional status, GI \nevaluation if indicated, and family history. Each of these elements of \nworkup is described in greater detail below.  \nImaging  \nThe primary workup for patients with clinical signs or symptoms of ovarian \ncancer should include an abdominal/pelvic US and/or abdominal/pelvic \nCT/MRI scan. U S is typically used for initial evaluation, as it has been \nshown to be effective at triaging the majority of adnexal masses into \nbenign or malignant categories.311-313 Other imaging modalities may be \nhelpful when the results of US are indeterminate (ie, either the organ of \norigin or malignant potential is unclear), and may improve assessment of \nmetastases, staging, and preoperative planning.311,313,314 Abdominal/pelvic \nMRI may be useful for determining malignant potential of adnexal masses \nif US is not reliable or results are indeterminate.311-313,315 -319 FDG -PET/CT \nscan may also be useful for indeterminate lesions.320-322 The NCCN Panel \nrecommends PET/CT or MRI for indeterminate lesions if they will alter \nmanagement.  \nVarious imaging methods and algorithms for evaluating imaging results \nhave been proposed for preoperatively distinguishing benign from \nmalignant adnexal masses, with the goal of determining which patients \nshould have surgery and/or be referred to a gynecol ogic oncologist for \nfurther evaluation and surgery.

MS-10 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \npredicting malignancy have been developed and tested prospective \nstudies comparing preoperative US results to final diagnosis after \nsurgery .323-327 The most thoroughly tested of these are the International \nOvarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Simple Rules algorithm, based on five US \nfeatures;188,328 -337 and the IOTA logistic regression model (LR2), which \ncombines five US  variables with age.186,338 -341 A variety of MRI -based \napproaches for distinguishing benign from malignant masses have been \nexplored in prospective trials comparing preoperative MRI results to final \npostoperative diagnosis, although these approaches have been less \nthoroughly tested than  the US techniques. Examples include proton MR \nspectroscopy,342 diffusion -weighted imaging (DWI),343-345 apparent \ndiffusion coefficient (ADC) maps,346 3.0 Tesla (3T) MRI,347 and dynamic \ncontrast -enhanced (DCE) MRI.348 Although both US and MRI are \nrecommended options for preoperative imaging, the NCCN Guidelines are \nsilent regarding the exact techniques used for each , and do not endorse \nany specific model for preoperative triage . \nFor assessment of abdominopelvic metastases for preoperative staging, \nestimation of resectability, and surgical planning, abdominal/pelvic CT or \nMRI are generally more useful than US.314,315,318,349 -351 Although CT is \npreferred in some circles, MRI has been shown to provide equivalent \naccuracy for staging and comparable accuracy for predicting peritoneal \ntumor volume, and can be useful if CT results are inconclusive.314 For \nassessing advanced disease, FDG -PET/CT may also be useful if CT \nresults are indeterminate, and has been shown to have higher accuracy \nthan CT for detection of metastases.314,321,352 -355 \nAlthough there is no direct evidence that chest x -ray or chest CT is \nnecessary, panel members felt that it should be part of the overall \nevaluation of a patient before surgical staging if clinically indicated. CT of \nthe chest can detect pleural or pulmonar y metastases, as well as pleural effusion, which may help with treatment planning.314 All CT/MRI imaging \nshould be performed with contrast unless contraindicated.  \nLaboratory Studies and Biomarker Tests  \nAppropriate laboratory studies for patients presenting with clinical \nsymptoms /signs  of ovarian cancer include CBC and chemistry profile with \nliver function test.  \nA number of specific biomarkers and algorithms using multiple biomarker \ntest results have been proposed for preoperatively distinguishing benign \nfrom malignant tumors in patients who have an undiagnosed \nadnexal/pelvic mass. Biomarker tests developed and ev aluated in \nprospective trials comparing preoperative serum levels to postoperative \nfinal diagnosis include serum HE4 and CA -125, either alone or combined \nusing the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm [ROMA] \nalgorithm ;185,187,356 -371 the MIA (brand name OVA1) based on serum levels \nof five markers: transthyretin, apolipoprotein A1, transferrin, beta -2 \nmicroglobulin, and CA -125154,212 -216,372; and the second -generation MIA \n(MIA2G, branded name OVERA) based on CA -125, transferrin, \napolipoprotein A1, follicle -stimulating hormone [FSH] , and HE4.184,373 The \nFDA has approved the use of ROMA, OVA1 , or OVERA for estimating the \nrisk for ovarian cancer in those  with a n adnexal mass for which surgery is \nplanned, and have not yet been referred to an oncologist.217,374,375 \nAlthough the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n(ACOG ) has suggested that ROMA and OVA1 may be useful for deciding \nwhich patients to refer to a gynecologic oncologist,376 other professional \norganizations have been non -committal.161,312,377 Not all studies have \nfound that multi -biomarker assays improve all metrics ( ie, sensitivity, \nspecificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) for \nprediction of malignancy compared with other methods (eg, imaging, \nsingle -biomarker tests, symptom index/clinical assessment).185,215,357,378 -380 \nCurrently, the NCCN Panel does not recommend the use of these PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

This \nrecommendation is based on data showing that serum CA -125 levels \ncorrelate with extent of disease, and may have prognostic value, so may \nhelp in treatment planning.381-385 Serum CA -125 levels tend to correlate \nwith the clinical course of disease, especially in those with elevated \npretreatment levels, so can be useful for monitoring response to therapy \nand surveillance for recurrence.4,382,384 -396 \nSome evidence suggests that HE4 may be a useful prognostic marker in \npatients with ovarian cancer, decreases during response to treatment, and \nmay improve early detection of recurrence relative to CA -125 alone.397-424 \nNCCN Panel members sometimes test HE4 in patients who do not have \nelevate d CA-125, as HE4 can be useful for future monitoring in such \npatients. However, because results  vary across studies,425-427 the NCCN \nGuidelines currently do not recommend routine HE4 as part of \npreoperative workup.  \nIn addition to CA -125, the NCCN Guidelines mention that other tumor \nmarkers may be used as part of preoperative workup, if clinically indicated: \ninhibin, alpha -fetoprotein [AFP], beta –human chorionic gonadotropin \n[beta -hCG], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ca rcinoembryonic antigen \n[CEA] , and CA19 -9. Serum levels of these markers can be elevated in \npatients with certain LCOC s, and correlate with disease course in some of \nthese patients. Measurement of these markers prior to surgery can help to \nassess for LCOC  (see Less Common Ovarian Cancers ), and facilitate \nfuture monitoring during surveillance after treatment, especially in patients \nwho do not have elevated serum CA -125 at baseline and/or have tumor \ntypes in which CA -125 level is less likely to be informative.395 For example, AFP, beta -hCG, and LDH are markers for malignant germ \ncell tumors that can be helpful in intraoperative diagnosis, preoperative \nplanning, and post -treatment monitoring for recurrence.376,395,428 -436 AFP \ncan be produced by endodermal sinus (yolk sac) tumors, embryonal \ncarcinomas, polyembryomas, and immature teratomas; beta -hCG can be \nproduced by choriocarcinomas, embryonal carcinomas, polyembryomas, \nand, in low levels, in some dysgerminomas; and LDH c an be a marker for \ndysgerminoma.428,429 Some studies in young patients presenting with an \novarian mass have found that high levels of AFP and beta -hCG were \ncorrelated with higher likelihood of malignancy,436,437 or linked to specific \nsubtypes,431,438,439 suggesting that these markers may help with \nintraoperative diagnosis to determine whether fertility -sparing surgery is an \noption. High serum AFP levels and poor decline in serum AFP levels after \ntreatment appear to be associated with worse outcomes in pat ients with \ngerm cell tumors.432,438 -443 High serum beta -CG may also be correlated \nwith poorer prognosis.432,444 High levels of serum LDH have been \ncorrelated with more extensive disease and poor outcomes in some \npatients with ovarian germ cell tumors.443,445 -447 If a patient with a germ cell \ntumor or sex chord stromal tumor has elevated levels of one or more of \nthese markers at baseline, and levels decline after treatment, then the \nmarker(s) is more likely to be useful for follow -up for recurrence.448 AFP \nand hCG are commonly used to monitor for recurrence in patients with \ngerm cell tumors ( GCTs ), and have included clinical trials for detection of \nrecurrence.448-451 \nSex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary, particularly granulosa cell tumors, \ncan produce inhibin, and inhibin expression level in tumor tissue and \nserum have been proposed as diagnostic markers.395,452 -461 Some studies \nhave shown that serum levels of inhibin A and B, particularly inhibin B, \ncorrelate with extent of disease in patients with granulosa cell tumors, \ndecreasing during treatment and then increasing again prior to relapse, \nleading to the proposal that serum inhibin monitoring may be helpful for PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Patients with ovarian cancer often \npresent with bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating , or feeling \nfull quickly,144 which can lead to changes in dietary habits that result in \npoor nutritional status. Poor nutritional status has been linked to higher \nrisk of suboptimal surgery, surgical complications, and poor survival, \nespecially in older patients.495-501 There are a variety of ways to assess  \nnutritional status , includ ing body weight, body mass index, \nanthropometrics, serum protein, serum albumin, transferrin, lymphocyte count, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and body composition measures \n(adipose and lean tissues , skeletal muscle index ).495-498,500,502 -516 Two \ncommonly used metrics are the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and \nsubjective global assessment (SGA).496,504,517 -523 Evaluation of nutritional \nstatus is recommended as part of baseline workup as it is important for \ndetermining whether a patient is a good surgical candidate, and for \npreoperative planning.480,524 For those who are not good surgical \ncandidates, NACT  may be a better option versus upfront debulking \nsurgery. However, poor nutritional status in the context of a GI mass may \nbe an indication for prioritizing surgery to remove or reduce the GI \nmass,525,526 especially if the patient is otherwise a relatively fit surgical \ncandidate.  \nGiven that GI cancers and primary mucinous carcinoma of the ovary can \nboth cause serum CEA elevation,4,469 -477 and can both present with \nadnexal masses, GI tract evaluation is especially important in these \npatients to determine whether patients have metastases to the ovary or \nprimary mucinous carcinoma of the ovary (see Mucinous Carcinomas ).527 \nThe presence of a pancreatic mass or widespread abdominal disease \nshould also increase suspicion for primary GI cancer.  \nFamily History and Genetic Testing  \nObtaining a family history and referral to a genetic counselor is an \nimportant part of workup, as some patients may have hereditary traits that \nmay inform future treatment and determine whether family members \nshould be screened. Primary treatment (surgery and chemotherapy) \nshould not be delayed for a genetic counselling referral, however, as \ngenetic test results are not needed for selection of primary surgery and/or \nchemotherapy, and delay in treatment is associated with poorer \noutcomes.528,529 Recommendations regarding genetic testing can be found \nin the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: \nBreast , Ovarian , and Pancreatic  and the NCCN Guidelines for PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

See Molecular Testing  section below.  \nPrediction of Malignancy, Referral to a Gynecologic Oncologist  \nThere are a number of prediction algorithms that combine multiple factors, \nsuch as symptoms, imaging results, biomarkers, and patient \ncharacteristics, to predict the likelihood of malignancy among patients who \nhave an undiagnosed adnexal mass (ie, a mass d etected by clinical exam \nor imaging that has not yet been resected and definitively diagnosed by \npathology).316,338,351,371,530 These algorithms were developed with the goal \nof reducing the number and/or extent of unnecessary surgeries by using \nthe likelihood of malignancy to determine which patients are most likely to \nbenefit from surgery, and/or identify cases to be referred to a gynecologic \noncologist for further testing and surgery. Many of these algorithms have  \nbeen tested in prospective trials comparing preoperative prediction to \npostoperative histologically confirmed diagnosis, including IOTA \nAssessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX), which uses \npatient age, type of center (oncology referral vs other), serum CA -125, and \nsix US  variables;316,330,531,532 Risk of Malignancy Indexes (RMI -1 through \n4), which use US features, patient menopausal status, and serum CA -\n125;339,358,359,533 -539 combining symptom index (SI) with CA -125 and HE4 \nresults;153 and the (early) ACOG/SGO referral guidelines based on patient \nage, CA -125 level, physical findings, imaging results, and family \nhistory.351,371,540 Several prospective studies have compared multiple \nalgorithms or algorithms v ersus other metrics to determine which most \naccurately predicts malignancy.212,214,215,338,357 -359,378,379 Currently the NCCN Guidelines do not endorse any of these methods. \nBecause primary assessment and debulking by a gynecologic oncologist \nis associated with improved survival, all patients with lesions suspected to \nbe ovarian malignancies (based on clinical evidence) should be referred to \nan experienced gynecologic oncologist for evaluation —both to assess \nsuitability for different primary surgical options and to select the best \nmethod for obtaining the material needed for definitive diagnosis.147,218 -221 \nA gynecologic oncologist should be involved in assessing whether a \npatient is a suitable surgical candidate and/or an appropriate candidate for \nneoadjuvant therapy, and consideration of laparoscopic evaluation to \ndetermine feasibility of debulking surgery .

At times, patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer \nhave had cytoreductive surgery and comprehensive staging procedures \n(ie, having met the standards for surgical staging of the Gynecologic \nOncology Group [GOG]).541 In some instances, referral occurs after \nincomplete surgery and/or staging (eg, uterus and/or adnexa intact, \nomentum not removed, incomplete lymph node dissection, residual \ndisease that is potentially resectable, surgical stage not completely \ndocumented, occult invasive carcinoma found at time of risk reduction \nsurgery). The components of surgical staging are listed in the algorithm \n(see Principles of Surgery  in the algorithm ). \nWorkup procedures are very similar for patients having undiagnosed or \ndiagnosed pelvic masses at the time of referral.

Additional \nimaging may be needed to screen for distant disease and evaluate for \nresidual disease not removed during the previous surgery. Imaging \noptions include chest/abdominal/pelvic CT  or MRI, PET/CT, and/or US. All \nimaging should be performed with contrast unless contraindicated. \nPathology review of tissue from the previous surgery is important for \nconfirming diagnosis and cancer type.  CBC and chemistry profile with \nLFTs should be obtained, and CA-125 or other tumor markers should be \nmeasured if indicated to corroborate likely diagnosis  and to serve as \nbaseline for future follow -up.

As described in the Molecular Testing  \nsection below, g ermline and/or somatic BRCA1/2  testing informs selection \nof maintenance therapy (after first -line platinum -based chemotherapy). \nMolecular analysis of tumor tissue from the previous surgery may be \nwarranted. In the absence of a BRCA1/2  mutation, homologous \nrecombination deficiency status may provide information on the magnitude \nof benefit of PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy (category 2B).  \nDiagnosis, Pathology , and Staging  \nMost ovarian cancers, including the LCOC , are diagnosed after pathologic \nanalysis of a biopsy or surgical specimen, which may occur preoperatively, \nintraoperatively, or postoperatively. If possible, fine -needle aspiration \n(FNA) should be avoided for diagnosis of ovarian cancer in patients with \npresumed early -stage disease to prevent rupturing the cyst and spilling \nmalignant cells into the peritoneal cavity; however, FNA may be necessary \nin patients who are not candidates for primary debulking, such as those  with bulky disease, older patients, or patients in poor health.542,543 Both \nprimary peritoneal and fallopian  tube cancers are usually diagnosed \npostoperatively (if there is no major involvement of the ovary) or \npreoperatively (if there is a biopsy and the patient has already had a \nbilateral oophorectomy). Patients who have equivocal pathologic findings \nor who ar e referred to NCCN Member Institutions after having a previous \ndiagnosis of ovarian cancer should have their pathology reviewed by \npathologists at NCCN Member Institutions.  \nPrimary peritoneal and fallopian  tube cancers are treated in the same \nmanner as epithelial ovarian cancer, so distinguishing these three possible \nprimary sites is less crucial than ruling out other cancers that commonly \ninvolve the adnexa, such as uterine, cervical, gastro intestinal (small and \nlarge bowel, pancreatic ) cancers or lymphoma;544,545 benign ovarian and \nnon-ovarian conditions also need to be ruled out (eg, serous \ncystadenoma).546 In addition, metastases to the ovaries need to be ruled \nout (see Mucinous Carcinomas ). \nThe CAP protocol is a useful tool for pathology reports, and has been \nupdated for consistency with the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th \nedition.230,547 Based on the CAP protocol (Version 1.1. 1.0; Feb 2020 )230 \nand panel consensus, the NCCN Guidelines recommend that pathologic \nassessment should include the following elements: all tumor site(s)  (eg, \novary, fallopian  tube, pelvic/abdominal peritoneum, uterus, cervix, \nomentum); all tumor size(s); for ovarian/ fallopian  tumors, surface \ninvolvement (present/absent/cannot determine), specimen integrity \n(capsule/serosa intact/fractured/fragmented); histologic type and grade ; \nextension and/or implants (if sampled/identified); cytology results from \nperitoneal/ascitic fluid /washings and pleural fluid; the number and location \nof lymph nodes examined, and size of largest lymph node metastatic \ndeposits;  and evidence of STIC, endometriosis [particularly if in continuity \nwith endometrioid or clear cell carcinoma], and endosalpingiosis.

MS-15 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nThe complete histologic classification from the WHO is included in the \nNCCN Guidelines.1 The WHO pathology manual is also a useful \nresource.1,548 \nHistologic Subtypes  \nEpithelial ovarian cancer has four main subtypes, including serous, \nendometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell; most patients (about 70%) have \nserous cancers .3,549 -552 Molecular characterization of clear cell, mucinous, \nor low -grade (grade 1) serous tumors suggests that mutations in these \ncancer types are different from those in higher grade tumors.553-555 Ovarian \ncancer can be divided into Types 1 and 2 based on these molecular \nalterations. Data suggest that serous tumors can be categorized as either \nlow grade (grade 1) or high grade (grade 2 or 3).549,556 -561 \nOvarian borderline epithelial tumors, also called LMP tumors or atypical \nproliferative tumors, are another type of primary epithelial lesions. The \nterms for borderline epithelial tumors have changed over the years, and \nrecent CAP protocols do not use “LMP .”230,562 Borderline tumors have \ncytologic characteristics suggesting malignancy, and may grossly \nresemble an invasive cancer, but microscopic evaluation shows no \nevidence of frank invasion by the tumor nodules, although rarely invasive \nimplants (which continue to b e consistent with the diagnosis of borderline \nepithelial lesions) can be identified microscopically by the pathologist. The \ncharacteristic pathologic hallmark of typical epithelial ovarian cancer is the \nidentification of peritoneal implants, which microsc opically and/or \nmacroscopically invade the peritoneum. Borderline epithelial tumors are \ntypically serous or mucinous; but other histologic subtypes can also occur  \n(see WHO Histologic Classification  in the algorithm ).1,230 \nCarcinosarcomas arising in the ovary, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum, also \ncalled carcinomas of Müllerian  origin or MMMTs, are biphasic, with both \nmalignant epithelial and sarcomatous elements. Clonality studies suggest that this is a metaplastic carcinoma, with both components arising from an \nepithelial precursor, and the sarcomatous component resulting from \ntransdifferentiation (epithelial -mesenchymal transition).563-570 \nGerm cell tumors are a non -epithelial subtype, and include \ndysgerminomas, immature teratomas, embryonal tumors, and endodermal \nsinus (yolk sac) tumors.1 Malignant sex cord -stromal tumors, another non -\nepithelial subtype, are rare and include granulosa cell tumors (most \ncommon) and Sertoli -Leydig cell tumors.1 \nIn some cases, it can be difficult to distinguish between cancer subtypes. \nFor example, high -grade endometrioid tumors can be difficult to \ndistinguish from high -grade serous tumors.549 Some endometrioid tumors \nlook similar to clear cell tumors, while others may resemble sex cord -\nstromal tumors.549 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with certain markers may \nhelp with differential diagnosis. Whereas most (80 %–90%) of serous \ncarcinomas are positive for WT1, endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas \nare usually negative.562,571,572 Endometrioid adenocarcinomas are usually \npositive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), PAX8, CA -125, and estrogen receptors. \nThe presence of endometriosis can sometimes help to distinguish \nsubtypes, as clear cell carcinomas and endometrioid tumors can be \nassociated w ith endometriosis, whereas other subtypes are less likely to \nbe.562 Endometrioid carcinomas are also very similar in appearance to sex \ncord-stromal tumors.562 Most clear cell carcinomas express Napsin A, a \nmarker that is specific to this subtype.573 It is difficult to distinguish based \non histology between primary mucinous ovarian carcinomas and GI \nmetastases.574-576 PAX8 immunostaining is typical of primary tumors,572 \nalthough absence of PAX8 doe s not rule out ovary as the primary site.  \nSATB2 is consistent with colonic origin.577 Metastatic colorectal \nadenocarcinomas also usually are positive for CK20  and CEA.  \nStage at diagnosis, prognosis, the typical course of disease, and \nresponsiveness to specific therapies vary across cancer PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-16 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nsubtypes.6,549,551,552,578,579 In the NCCN Guidelines, most of the \nrecommendations are based on data from patients with the most common \nsubtypes —high-grade serous and grade 2/3 endometrioid. The NCCN \nGuidelines also include recommendations specifically for patients with less \ncommon ovarian cancers  (LCOC ), which in the Guidelines include the \nfollowing: carcinosarcoma, clear cell carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, low -\ngrade serous, grade 1 endometrioid, borderline epithelial, malignant sex \ncord-stromal, and malignant germ cell tumors.  \nStaging  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer reflect the importance of stage \nand grade of disease on prognosis and treatment recommendations. \nOvarian cancer is classified primarily as stages I to IV using the FIGO \n(International Federation of Gynecology and Obst etrics) staging system, \nwhich was approved by the AJCC and incorporated into the AJCC Cancer \nStaging Manual 8th Edition staging system, which was published in late \n2016 and was effective for all cancer cases recorded on or after January \n1, 2018 (see Stagin g section of the algorithm).547,557 More than half of \npatients present with distant disease, although certain LCOC  are more \nlikely to be diagnosed at earlier stages7,9,580 Serous ovarian cancer is now \noften referred to as either low grade (most grade 1 serous tumors) or high \ngrade (most grade 2 or 3 serous tumors).230,549,556,557,559,560 Pathologists \nmay use histologic grades 1, 2, or 3 for endometrioid carcinomas, \nmucinous carcinomas, and stage IC tumors.230 Primary peritoneal \nadenocarcinoma, fallopian  tube carcinoma, and LCOC  are also staged \nusing the FIGO/AJCC (8th edition) ovarian cancer staging system.547,556,557 \nExcept for select individuals  with stage I, grade 1 tumors (in whom survival \nis greater than 95% after comprehensive laparotomy), patients in all other \nstages of ovarian cancer are likely to require treatment after surgical \nstaging. All patients with ovarian cancer, particularly those requiring \nadditional treatment, should be encouraged to participate in a relevant \nclinical trial.  A pathology and staging cancer protocol is available from the College of \nAmerican Pathologists (CAP) for examination of specimens from patients \nwith primary tumors of the ovary, fallopian  tube, or peritoneum, including \npTNM requirements from the AJCC Staging Manual 8th edition and FIGO \nStaging.230PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-17 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nMolecular Testing  \nUpon pathologic confirmation of ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or \nprimary peritoneal cancer, patients should be referred for a genetic risk \nevaluation and germline and somatic testing (if not previously done). This \nrecommendation for germline and somatic testing is intentionally broad so \nthat the genetic counselor and treating o ncologist have the latitude to \norder whichever molecular tests they consider necessary based on \nevaluation of the individual patient  and their cancer family history . Since \ngermline and/or somatic BRCA1/2  testing informs selection of \nmaintenance therapy for  those with stage II –IV disease who are in \ncomplete response ( CR) or partial response ( PR) after first -line platinum -\nbased chemotherapy, NCCN Panel members agree that it is important to \nestablish BRCA1/2  mutation status for patients who may be eligible for \nmaintenance therapy following completion of platinum -based first -line \nchemotherapy. Homologous recombination status  (e.g., homologous \nrecombination deficient [HRD] vs. homologous recombination proficient \n[HRP])  may provide information on the magnitude of benefit of PARP \ninhibitor maintenance therapy for those without a BRCA1/2  mutation. For \nadditional recommendations on workup, staging and primary treatment for \novarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer, \nplease refer to OV -1 in the guidelines on http://www.NCCN.org .  \nWith the availability of next -generation sequencing technology, the panel \ndiscussed whether comprehensive tumor molecular analys is should be \nrecommended for all patients. Some panel members stated that \ncomprehensive tumor testing may not be necessary for certain patients in \nthe upfront setting, specifically those with a germline mutation in BRCA1/2  \nor other homologous recombination/DNA repair pathway genes . However , \nsome patients (such as those who lack a BRCA1/2  mutation or experience \ndisease recurrence ) may benefit from a more thorough tumor molecular \nanalysis to inform additional targeted therapy options. The panel agreed that tumor testing may be beneficial at multiple points throughout the \nevolution of the disease.  \nTherefore, the current guidelines recommend tumor molecular analysis \nboth in the upfront setting and upon recurrence (OV -B 1 of 3). The goal of \ntumor testing in the upfront setting is to optimize identification of molecular \nalterations that can inform the use of interventions with demonstrated \nbenefit in this setting, such as PARP inhibitors. Molecular alterations that \nshould be probed for in this setting include BRCA1/2  status, loss of \nheterozygosity, or homologous recombination status, in the absence of a \ngermline BRCA  mutation.  \nOther tumor tissue molecular markers may inform selection of treatment \nfor persistent or recurrent disease but testing for these is not needed until \nthe disease has proven to be refractory or at time of relapse. The panel \nrecommends that tumor molecular an alysis in the recurrence setting \nshould include, at a minimum, tests to identify potential benefit from \ntargeted therapeutics that have tumor -specific or tumor -agnostic benefit. \nThese include (but are not limited to): BRCA1/2 , HR status, microsatellite \ninstability (MSI),  mismatch repair (MMR),  tumor mutational burden (TMB), \nBRAF, and NTRK , if prior testing did not include these markers. The panel \nemphasizes that more comprehensive tumor analysis may be particularly \nimportant for less common histologies with limited approved treatment \noptions. Prior to selection of systemic therapy for refr actory or recurrent \ndisease, validated tumor molecular testing should be performed in a \nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA )-approved facility \nusing the most r ecent available tumor tissue.  \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-18 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nPrimary Treatment   \nPrimary treatment for presumed ovarian , fallopian  tube, or primary \nperitoneal  cancer usually consists of appropriate surgical staging and \ndebulking surgery, followed in most (but not all) patients by systemic \nchemotherapy.13,142,218,581,582 However, for some patients with early -stage \ndisease, surgery alone (followed by observation) may be sufficient as \nprimary treatment. In addition , for certain histologic subtypes , adjuvant \ntherapy with hormonal agents are options  that may be considered . NACT \nwith interval debulking surgery (IDS) should be considered in patients with \nadvanced -stage ovarian cancer who are not good candidates for upfront \nprimary debulking surgery ( PDS) due to advanced age, frailty, poor \nperformance status, comorbidities, or who have disease unlikely to be \noptimally cytoreduced.480,583 Emerging data support an increasing role of \nPARP inhibitors in the management of ovarian cancer.584 In the primary \ntreatment setting, PARP inhibitors have been incorporated as NCCN -\nrecommended maintenance therapy options for select patients after first -\nline chemotherapy. Each of these primary treatment options , including \nmaintenance therapy options after first -line chemotherapy, are described \nin more detail below. As described above, for all patients with suspected \nor confirmed ovarian cancer  a gynecologic oncologist should be involved \nin assessing whether a patient is a suitable surgical candidate and/o r an \nappropriate candidate for neoadjuvant therapy, and consideration of \nlaparoscopic evaluation to determine feasibility of debulking surgery . The \nNCCN Guidelines recommend symptom management and best supportive \ncare for all patients; individuals  should be referred for palliative care \nassessment if appropriate (see the NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care, \navailable at www.NCCN.org ).161,585,586 \nPrimary Surgery  \nBased on published improved outcomes,  it is recommended that a \ngynecologic oncologist be the provider to determine the best surgical \napproach and perform the appropriate primary surgery.219-221 An open laparotomy is recommended for most patients, but minimally invasive \ntechniques may be appropriate in certain circumstances (See Open \nLaparotomy Versus Minimally Invasive Techniques) . Prior to surgery, \npatients with advanced disease should be counseled about port placement \nif intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is being considered. Intraoperative \npathologic evaluation with frozen sections may assist in management by \nproviding confirmation of diagnosis and cancer type and providing \ninformation about th e extent of disease. For all procedures,  the surgeon \nshould describe the following in the operative report: 1) the extent of initial \ndisease in the pelvis, mid abdomen, and upper abdomen before \ndebulking ; 2) whether a complete or incomplete resection was achieved ; \nand 3) if resection was incomplete, the amount and size of residual \ndisease in the aforementioned areas after debulking.587  \nFor most patients presenting with suspected malignant ovarian, fallopian  \ntube, or primary peritoneal neoplasm, initial surgery should include a \nhysterectomy (if uterus present) and BSO with comprehensive staging and \ndebulking as indicated.13,588,589 This is the recommended approach for \nstage IA –IV if optimal cytoreduction appears feasible, the patient is a \nsurgical candidate, and fertility is not a concern. It is described in greater \ndetail below in the section entitled Debulking Surgery for Newly Diagnosed \nDisease.   \nFor patients with early -stage disease who wish to preserve  fertility, less \nextensive surgery may be an option, as described in the section entitled \nFertility -Sparing Options for Stage I Disease.  \nNACT  with IDS should be considered for patients with advanced -stage \novarian cancer who are not good candidates for PDS due to advanced \nage, frailty, poor performance status, comorbidities, or who have disease \nunlikely to be optimally cytoreduced.480,583 The anticipated benefit from \nNACT therapy is to allow for medical improvement of the patient and/or \nclinical response that would increase the likelihood of optimal PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

See sections entitle d \nNeoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Interval Debulking Surgery . As described \nin the section entitled Laparoscopic Evaluation Prior to Resection , for \ncertain patients with bulky disease , a minimally invasive procedure may be \nappropriate for obtaining biopsy material to confirm diagnosis and/or for \nmolecular testing, and for determining whether optimal cytoreduction is \npossible.  \nOpen Laparotomy Versus Minimally Invasive Techniques  \nIn most cases where surgery is recommended as part of primary treatment \nfor suspected malignant ovarian, fallopian  tube, or primary peritoneal \nneoplasm, it should be performed by open laparotomy including a vertical \nmidline abdominal incision. The surgical guidelines emphasize that an \nopen laparotomy should be used for most patients undergoing  surgical \nstaging, primary debulking, interval debulking, or secondary cytoreduction .  \nImprov ement of  minimally invasive methods and selection of appropriate \npatients are the topics of much study and debate.590-620 Minimally invasive \ntechniques are commonly used for early -stage disease  (or presumed \nearly -stage disease) , and some studies have shown no difference in \nsurgical outcomes, recurrence rates, or survival for those who received \nminimally invasive versus open surgical staging.591,593 -595,598 -600,604,611 -614,621 -\n625 If signs of lymph node metastasis or localized carcinomatosis are \nfound, lymphadenectomy and complete pelvic peritonectomy may be \nfeasible using minimally invasive techniques.608 The NCCN Guidelines \nindicate that in early -stage disease, minimally invasive techniques to \nachieve the surgical goals may be considered in selected patients if \nperformed by an experienced gynecologic oncologist.315,588,601,626,627  \nStudies in patients undergoing PDS for advanced disease have shown \nthat debulking and surgical staging is technically feasible using minimally \ninvasive techniques, and h ysterectomy and unilateral salpingo -oophorectomy ( USO ) or BSO can be achieved using a minimally invasive \napproach .597,602 Several studies have reported results for patients who \nreceived IDS via minimally invasive techniques, following \nNACT .603,606,607,609,619 These studies have shown that for patients \nundergoing IDS,  minimally invasive approaches are safe , technically \nfeasible, and can achieve optimal cytoreduction ; cancer -specific survival \nmay be worse (than with laparotomy) if patients are not carefully selected ; \nand patients with extensive disease will likely need to be conver ted to \nopen lapartomy.603,606,607,609,619 The NCCN Guidelines recommend that i n \nselect patients  (who have undergone NACT) , minimally invasive \nprocedures may be used for IDS, provided that optimal debulking can be \nachieved. If the patient cannot be optimally debulked using minimally \ninvasive techniques, either in the PDS or IDS setting, then they should be \nconverted to an open procedure.  \nLaparoscopic Evaluation Prior To Resection  \nIn select patients with advanced -stage disease, minimally invasive \nprocedures  (assessment laparoscopy)  may be used to assess whether \noptimal cytoreduction is likely to be achieved by PDS, in order to \ndetermine whether NACT may be a better initial treatment  option .628-639 A \nrandomized  trial assessed whether laparoscopy would be useful to predict \nthe ability to achieve optimal cytoreduction (<1 cm residual disease). \nOptimal cytoreduction was achieved in 90% (92/102) of patients \nrandomized to the assessment laparoscopy arm compared to 61% (60/99) \nof patients who were randomized to the laparotomy without assessment \nlaparoscopy arm (relative risk  [RR], 0.25; 95% CI, 0.13 –0.47; P < .001).634 \nAssessment laparoscopy  to evaluate extent of disease and feasibility of \nresection was used frequently in the large prospective trials validating \nNACT and IDS and was required in one of these trials (SCORPION) .481-\n483,639,640  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-20 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nFertility -Sparing Options for Stage I Disease  \nFertility preservation is an evolving field and area of active research , with \nmany approaches  being explored, and many patient - and case -specific \nfactors to consider , especially for those  with malignancies .641-643 Patients \nwho wish to retain  fertility options should be referred to a reproductive \nendocrinologist for preoperative evaluation and consultation. Large \nretrospective studies and meta -analyses have found that for stage I \nepithelial ovarian cancer, fertility -sparing surgery did not appear to \ncompromise disease -free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) compared \nwith radical surgery.644-653 Although clear cell histology is associated with \nincreased risk of poor outcomes,651 some studies have shown that even \namong patients with stage I clear cell, fertility -sparing surgery does not \nincrease risk of relapse or shorten survival compared with radical \nsurgery.645,646,649,650,653 Large retrospective studies among patients with \nstage I borderline ovarian tumors have found that recurrence rate and \nsurvival is similar for those treated with fertility -sparing versus radical \nsurgery.654-657 In retrospective studies , including  multivariate analyses, \nfertility -sparing surgery does not appear to be associated with poorer \noutcomes (DFS, progression -free survival [ PFS], OS) compared with more \nextensive surgery in patients with  stage I germ cell tumors and sex  cord-\nstromal tumors.658-673 Fertility-sparing surgery may be considered for \npatients who wish to preserve fertility and have apparent early -stage \ndisease and/or low -risk tumors, such as early -stage invasive epithelial \ntumors, LMP lesions, malignant germ cell tumors, or malignant sex cor d-\nstromal tumors. Even if the contralateral ovary cannot be spared,  uterine \npreservation can be considered as it allows for potential future assisted \nreproductive approaches. A  USO (preserving the uterus and contralateral \novary /fallopian tube) and comprehensive surgical staging may be \nadequate for select patients who wish to preserve fertility and appear to \nhave stage IA unilateral tumors.674-679 For those with bilateral stage IB \ntumors who wish to maintain fertility, a BSO (preserving the uterus) and \ncomprehensive surgical staging can be considered . In patients undergoing USO or BSO, c omprehensive surgical staging should still be performed in \nmost patients to rule out occult higher -stage disease, because data show \nthat approximately 30% of patients (with presumed early -stage disease) \nare upstaged after undergoing complete staging surgery.595,599,600,680 -684 \nComprehensive surgical staging may be omitted in pediatric/adolescent \npatients with clinically apparent early -stage malignant germ cell tumors \nbased on the pediatric surgical literature  suggesting that incomplete \nstaging does not result in poorer outcomes  (OS) .685 For adults with \napparent stage I malignant ovarian germ cell tumors, comprehensive \nstaging is recommended based on results from retrospective studies  \nsuggest ing that incomplete  surgical  staging may be associated with \nincreased risk of recurrence ;686,687 although others found no relationship \nbetween incomplete staging and DFS.688 \nDebulking Surgery  for Newly  Diagnosed Disease  \nDebulking surgery is widely accepted as an important component of initial \ntreatment for patients with clinical stage II, III, or IV disease , and multiple \nretrospective studies have contributed to the understanding of the extent \nof debulking needed to achieve maximal cytoreduction .142,218,221,676,680,689 -691 \nOptimal cytoreduction is defined as residual disease less than 1 cm in \nmaximum diameter or thickness;589,676,692 -694 however, maximal effort \nshould be made to remove all gross disease since resection to R0 offers \nsuperior survival outcomes.689,695 Although debulking surgery is the \nstandard of care, this recommendation is based on retrospective data (and \nthus is not a category 1 recommendation).694 In general, the procedures \ndescribed in this section  should be part of the surgical management of \npatients with ovarian, fallopian  tube, or primary peritoneal cancer in an \neffort to fully stage patients and to achieve maximal debulking preferable \nto resection of all visible disease in appropriate circumstances and at least \nto less than 1 -cm residual disease if complete cytoreduction is not \nfeasible .696-698 These procedures also apply to many of the LCOC .

MS-21 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nFor patients with newly  diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer apparently \nconfined to an ovary or to the pelvis, the goal of surgery is to achieve \ncomplete cytoreduction of all pelvic disease and to evaluate for occult \ndisease in the upper abdomen or retroperitoneum. For patients with newly \ndiagnosed invasive epithelial ovarian cancer involving the pelvis and upper \nabdomen, the goal is to achieve  optimal cytoreduction of all abdominal, \npelvic , and retroperitoneal disease.  \nOn entering the abdomen, aspiration of ascites or peritoneal lavage should \nbe performed for peritoneal cytologic examinations. For obvious disease \nbeyond the ovaries, cytologic assessment of ascites and/or lavage \nspecimens will not alter stage or management. For patients with disease \napparently confined to an ovary or to the pelvis, all peritoneal surfaces \nshould be visualized, and any peritoneal surface or adhesion suspicious \nfor harboring metastasis should be selectively excised or biopsied. In the \nabsenc e of any suspicious areas, random peritoneal biopsies should be \ntaken from the pelvis, paracolic gutters, and undersurfaces of the \ndiaphragm.  \nHysterectomy and BSO should be performed. Although hysterectomy is \nrecommended for most patients, USO or BSO with uterine preservation \nmay be considered for selected patients  with apparent stage IA/IB disease  \ndesiring to preserve fertility  (See Fertility -Sparing Options for Stage I \nDisease ). Every effort should be made to keep a n encapsulated ovarian \nmass intact  during removal .543,598 For young patients who will abruptly \nenter menopause after surgery, various supportive care measures may be \nused to help decrease hot flashes and other symptoms , and potentially \nreduce the risk of other systemic comorbidities that are more likely with \nsurgical menopause .699-702 HRT has not been shown to worsen survival in \npremenopausal patients with gynecologic cancers, but limited perspective \ndata exist.703,704 For patients with disease apparently confined to an ovary or to the pelvis  \n(presumed stage I/II) , omentectomy should be performed  to rule out \nhigher -stage disease . For patients with disease involving the pelvis and \nupper abdomen  (stage III/IV) , all involved omentum should be removed.  \nThe use of systematic lymphadenectomy is an area of controversy. For \npatients with presumed early stage, a randomized trial showed that \nsystematic aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy improved detection of \nmetastatic nodes compared with node sampling  (positive nodes found in 9 \nvs. 22%; P = .007) , but was not associated with improved PFS or OS.705 \nOperating time and the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusions \nwas significantly higher for those who underwent systematic \nlymphadenectomy.705 However, meta -analyses that included retrospective \nor observational studies have reported that systematic lymphadenectomy \nimproves OS in patients with early -stage disease, even though it does not \nimprove PFS.706,707 Similar to this randomized controlled trial, other \nprospective studies using systematic lymphadenectomy have found 3% to \n14% of patients had positive lymph nodes.708-712 \nFor patients with advanced ovarian cancer, s ome early prospective \nstudies suggested that systematic lymphadenectomy improved \nsurvival.713,714 An early international  randomized trial in patients with stage \nIIIB–IV (optimally debulked) epithelial ovarian cancer found that systematic \nlymphadenectomy improved PFS compared with resection of bulky nodes \nonly, although OS was not improved, operating times were longer, and \nmore patients required blood transfusions.715 A randomized study of \npatients with stage IA –IV disease undergoing second look surgery found \nthat although systematic lymphadenectomy increased detection of nodal \nmetastases compare d with resection of bulky nodes only  (positive nodes \nfound in 24% vs . 13%; P = .02), this did not translate into improved PFS or \nOS in the whole population or in subpopulations based on stage or extent \nof resection.716 As in other studies, systematic lymphadenectomy was PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Para -aortic lymph node \ndissection should be performed by stripping the nodal tissue from the vena \ncava and the aorta bilaterally to at least the level of the inferior mesenteric \nartery and preferably to the level of the renal vessels. The preferred \nmethod of dissecting pelvic lymph nodes is removal of lymph nodes \noverlying and anterolateral to the common iliac vessel, overlying and \nmedial to the external iliac vessel, overlying and medial to the hypogastric \nvessels, and from the obturator fossa at a m inimum anterior to the \nobturator nerve.541 \nFor those with more extensive disease outside of the pelvis  (nodules >2 \ncm), suspicious and/or enlarged nodes should be resected, if \npossible.715,721 Systematic lymph node dissection and r esection of clinically \nnegative nodes is not required for these patients because  results will not \nchange staging and the procedure does not appear to impact OS, based \non results from randomized trials (described above).715-717 Some surgeons classify debulking based on the number of procedures. \nProcedures that may be considered for optimal surgical cytoreduction (in \nall stages) include: bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping of the \ndiaphragm or other peritoneal surface s, splenectomy, partial cystectomy \nand/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, partial gastrectomy, \ncholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy.690,695,722 \nExtensive resection of upper abdominal metastases is recommended as \npart of debulking for patients who can tolerate this surgery, as it is \nassociated with improved PFS and OS.690,695 \nSelect patients with low -volume residual disease after surgical \ncytoreduction for stage II or III invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal \ncancer are potential candidates for IP therapy.723,724 In these patients, \nconsideration should be given to placement of an IP catheter with initial \nsurgery.588 \nSurgical Considerations for Mucinous Tumors  \nSince primary invasive mucinous tumors of the ovary are uncommon, it is \nimportant to establish the primary site in patients with these tumors. Thus, \nthe upper and lower GI tract should be carefully evaluated to rule out an \noccult GI primary with ovarian me tastases, and an appendectomy need \nonly be performed in patients with a suspected or confirmed mucinous \novarian neoplasm if it appears to be abnormal.725-727 A normal appendix \ndoes not require surgical resection in this setting.  \nSurgical Considerations for Ovarian Borderline Epithelial (LMP) Tumors  \nAlthough data show upstaging with lymphadenectomy, other data show \nthat lymphadenectomy does not affect OS.728-735 However, omentectomy \nand multiple biopsies of peritoneum (the most common sites of peritoneal \nimplants) may upstage patients and may affect prognosis ,734,736 -741 \nalthough some retrospective studies did not find association with \nprognosis .729,742 -744 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-23 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nAncillary Palliative Surgical Procedures  \nPatients presenting with symptoms may benefit from ancillary palliative \nprocedures performed during primary or secondary cytoreductive surgery. \nDecisions on the use of ancillary procedures should be made in \nconjunction with a gynecologic oncology surgeon or a practitioner familiar \nwith ovarian cancer patterns of recurrence.  Palliative surgical procedures \nthat may be appropriate in select patients include paracentesis or insertion \nof an indwelling peritoneal catheter, thoracentesis, pleurodesis, video -\nassist ed thora coscopy , or insertion of a pleural catheter, nephrostomy , or \nuse of ureteral stents, gastrostomy tube, intestinal stents, or surgical relief \nof intestinal obstruction.  \nAnalysis of Surgical Specimens  \nAs described in the section entitled Diagnosis, Pathology , and Staging , \nsurgical specimens should undergo pathology assessment to \ndetermine/confirm diagnosis, determine histologic subtype, and  determine  \nstage. Molecular testing is also appropriate for most patients; see \nMolecular Testing  section above for detailed recommendations.  \nPrimary Treatment for Patients Referred with Diagnoses by \nPrevious Surgery  \nFor patients referred with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer after a recent \nsurgical procedure, primary treatment depends on the findings  noted  \nduring the workup and evaluation performed by a gynecologic oncologist, \nincluding the type of cancer, apparent stage, and the extent of  residual \ndisease. For those with an epithelial cancer and no evidence of residual \ndisease on workup, further surgical staging is not needed if adjuvant \nchemotherapy is planned. For select subtypes, observation is an \nalternative to adju vant chemotherapy in patients with stage IA/IB  (Table 2 ). \nFor patients with these subtypes  and presumed stage IA/IB (and no \nevidence of residual disease), surgical staging can be considered if the \npatient would be a candidate for observation or reduce d number of cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy . In these cases, observation after complete \nsurgical staging is an option as long as the results confirm stage IA/IB \ndisease. If surgical staging indicates higher -stage disease, however, \nadjuvant chemotherapy is usually recommended, depending on the \nspeci fic cancer type.  In some cases with presumed  stage IA–IC and no \nsigns of residual disease detected by workup, patients may opt for surgical \nstaging to confirm whether they will be eligible for maintenance therapy \nfollowing adjuvant chemotherapy. As discussed below, bevacizumab and \nPARP inhibitor maintenance opti ons are only recommended for patients \nwith stage II –IV disease, so those with presumed stage IA–IC disease \nmay be particularly interested in surgical staging to determine whether \nthey should be upstaged  and thus eligible and/or needing mainten ance \ntherapy . \nFor patients who have an epithelial cancer and evidence of residual \ndisease on workup, tumor cytoreductive surgery is recommended if the \nresidual disease appears resectable. Following cytoreductive surgery, \nadjuvant treatment recommendations depend on canc er type and stage. If \nthe residual disease appears unresectable, patients should be treated with \nNACT  and IDS , and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy could be \nconsidered (see sections on Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy  and Interval \nDebulking Surgery ). \nManagement  After Primary Surgery  \nIn the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer, adjuvant therapy is defined \nas drugs or other forms of supplemental treatment following cancer \nsurgery intended to decrease the risk of disease recurrence or to primarily \ntreat residual disease, whether gross or m icroscopic, following surgical \ncytoreduction. Most patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian  tube, or \nprimary peritoneal cancer should receive adjuvant systemic chemotherapy \nafter primary surgery. Postoperative observation is an option for select \npatient s with stage I disease, depending on cancer histologic type and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Observation is considered an option in \nthese select groups of stage I patients either because survival is greater \nthan 90% with surgical treatment alone,  or because for low -risk disease in \ncertain cancer types it has not been demonstrated that adjuvant \nchemotherapy provides clear clinical benefit compared with observation \nalone  for those who have had complete surgical staging .745-751 \nFurthermore, postoperative observation should generally only be \nconsidered for patients who have had resection of all disease and \ncomplete surgical staging to rule out the possibility of clinically occult \ndisease that would result in upstaging. For some  of the less common \nepithelial cancer types ( eg, mucinous, grade 1 endometrioid, low -grade \nserous), the benefit of adjuvant systemic therapy has not been \ndemonstrated and observation is an option  (Table 2 ). If analysis of a \nbiopsy or surgical specimen shows a non -epithelial cancer type, such as \nsex cord -stromal or germ cell tumors, a patient should be treated \naccording to separate pathways specific for non -epithelial cancers ( see \nLess Common Ovarian Cancers: Malignant Sex Cord -Stromal Tumors  and \nMalignant Germ Cell Tumors  in the algorithm ). See sections below on \nthese less common cancer types.  \nA large variety of regimens and approaches have been tested in \nprospective randomized trials as postoperative therapy for patients with \nnewly  diagnosed ovarian cancer. Most of these regimens have included \nintravenous (IV) chemotherapy, but IP administration  of chemotherapy  has \nalso been tested, as have targeted agents and drugs from other classes. Recent trials have shown that maintenance therapy after postoperative \nplatinum -based chemotherapy can have a positive impact on PFS  in \npatients with advanced dise ase, so integration of maintenance therapy as \npart of postoperative management is increasing in prevalence and \nimportance.752-755 Selection of immediate postoperative treatment should \nbe informed by eligibility criteria for maintenance therapy. This is \ndiscussed in greater detail in the section entitled Options After First -Line \nChemotherapy.  \nBased on results of phase III randomized trials, the NCCN Guidelines \ninclude several options for postoperative treatment (within 6 weeks) in \npatients with  advanced epithelial cancers: platinum -based IV \nchemotherapy, platinum -based IV/IP chemotherapy, and platinum -based \nIP chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, as outlined in Table 3 . Specific \noptions an d supporting data for each of these categories of treatment are \ndescribed in greater detail in the sections below. For stage I disease, data \nare more limited, and wh ile the NCCN Guidelines include some platinum -\nbased IV chemotherapy options, IP/IV chemotherapy and use of \nbevacizumab are not recommended approaches for stage I disease ( Table \n2). Specific options for stage I disease are also discussed in a subsequent \nsection. For certain rarer cancer types, there are additional recommended \nadjuvant treatment options, including additional chemotherapy options, \nchemotherapy/bevacizumab regimens (s tage II –IV only), and hormonal \ntherapies ( Table 2  and Table 3 ). More informati on on these options can be \nfound in subsequent sections for specific LCOCs.\nTable 2: NCCN  Recommended Management Options Following Up Front Primary Surgery for Stage I Disease, Epithelial Cancer Types  \nCancer Type  Pathologic \nStaginga Recommended Options (category 2A unless otherwise noted)  \nObservation  Standard IV Platinum -\nBased Chemotherapyb Other Adjuvant Systemic Therapy  \nHigh -grade serous carcinoma  Stage IA/B/C  -- Yes -- \nGrade 2 endometrioid  Stage IA/IB  Yes Yes -- \nGrade 3 endometrioid  Stage IA/B/C  -- Yes -- PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

As for all aspects of their diagnosis and treatment \nof ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer , patients should be \nencouraged to participate in clinical trials.  Chemosensitivity/resistance \nand/or other biomarker assays have been proposed  for informing \ndecisions related to future chemotherapy in situations where there are \nmultiple eq uivalent chemotherapy options available , but the current level  \nof evidence is not sufficient to supplant standard -of-care chemotherapy \n(category 3). Prior to recommending chemotherapy, requirements for \nadequate organ function and performance status should be met.   \nDuring drug -based therapy, patients should be observed closely  and \ntreated for any complications. Appropriate blood chemistry tests should be \nmonitored. Appropriate dose reductions and modifications of \nchemotherapy should be performed depending on toxicities experienced \nand goals of therapy. Consider scalp cooling to reduce incidence of \nalopecia for patients receiving chemotherapy with high rates of alopecia.756 Options for IV  Chemot herapy  \nComparison of IV chemotherapy regimens for postoperative treatment of \nnewly  diagnosed ovarian cancer has been the subject of many prospective \nrandomized trials. Most of these trials have failed to show significant \ndifferences between regimens in efficacy outcomes (eg, PFS, OS), but \nmany have shown differences in toxicity profile, ability to complete the \nplanned therapy, and QOL . For this reason , the NCCN Guidelines include \na number of recommended options for postoperative IV chemotherapy in \npatients with ne wly diagnosed epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary \nperitoneal cancer. The NCCN -recommended options for platinum -based \nIV chemotherapy to treat stage II –IV epithelial disease are summarized in \nTable 4 , along with the list of trials that tested these regimens (last \ncolumn). Table 5 , Table 6 , and Table 7  summarize the results of \nrandomized trials that tested these recommended regimen s. The most \ncommonly  used regimen, paclitaxel 175/carboplatin, has been considered \nthe standard postoperative chemotherapy for ovarian cancer for many \nyears, so there are many studies in which it has been tested ( Table 5 , \nTable 6 , and Table 7 ).

Cisplatin was associated with higher rates of  \nneurotoxicity, GI toxicities ( eg, nausea, emesis) , renal  toxicity , metabolic \ntoxicit ies, anemia , and alopecia, while carboplatin was associated wit h \nhigher rates of thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia .767-770,785 -790 The \nAGO -OVAR -3 study found that QOL  was significantly better with \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel versus cisplatin/paclitaxel, both in global QOL  \nmetrics and on various subscales.769,770 Several randomized studies tested \nalternating carboplatin and cisplatin every other course, but found that \nefficacy was similar and toxicity somewhat worse than using carboplatin \nfor every course.774,790 Based on results  from all these studies  carboplatin \nis the recommended platinum agent for postoperative IV chemotherapy in \npatients with newly  diagnosed ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary \nperitoneal cancers.  Selecti ng a Non-Platinum Agent (for Use in Combination with a Platinum \nAgent)  \nMany different chemotherapy agents have been tested in combination with \nplatinum agents as options for IV chemotherapy in newly  diagnosed \novarian cancer. Large randomized trials have compared  various platinum -\nbased doublet, triplet, and quadruplet combinations with  \ncyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, docetaxel, topotecan, doxorubicin, \nepirubicin, gemcitabine, topotecan, and melphalan.764,765,773,775 -777,779 -782,791 -\n797 Trials that compared platinum -based doublets with cyclophosphamide \nversus paclitaxel showed that paclitaxel was associated with significantly \nbetter response rate, PFS and OS.791-793 Thus, paclitaxel  is preferred over \ncyclophosphamide for platinum -based combination therapy in the first -line \nsetting . Based on results from randomized trials showing improved safety \nand Q OL with carboplatin/paclitaxel versus cisplatin/paclitaxel  (Table \n5),767-770 carboplatin/paclitaxel became the “standard” combination therapy \noption  for postoperative first -line IV chemotherapy in patients with ovarian, \nfallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Most subsequent trials used \nthis doublet , usually paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 plus carboplatin AUC 5 –6, given \non day 1 of a 21 -day cycle,  as the control arm ( see examples in Table 5 , \nTable 6 , and Table 7 ). This regimen is also a recommended option in the \nNCCN Guidelines ( Table 4 ).

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  MS-32 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nTwo other platinum -based doublets have shown similar efficacy to \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel, but with different safety profiles.764,765 The \nSCOTROC1 study found that docetaxel/carboplatin resulted in similar \nPFS, OS , and global QOL  scores as paclitaxel/carboplatin, and was \nassociated with lower rates of neurotoxicity, arthralgia, myalgia, alopecia, \nand abdominal pain, but higher rates of other adverse events ( AEs) (GI, \nperipheral edema, allergic reactions , and nail changes [Table 7]).765 The \nMITO -2 trial found that pegylated  liposomal doxorubicin/carboplatin was \nassociated with a higher response rate but similar PFS and OS as \npaclitaxel/carboplatin ( Table 7).764 pegylated  liposomal \ndoxorubicin /carboplatin was associated with higher rates of certain \nhematologic toxicities, skin toxicity, and stomatitis, but lower rates of \nneurotoxicity and alopecia than the paclitaxel/carboplatin control.764 Global \nQOL  and most functional domains and symptom scales were the same \nacross treatment arms,  and pegylated  liposomal doxorubicin /carboplatin \nwas associated with worse scores for certain patient -reported toxicities.764 \nTherefore, this regimen may be useful in select patients at high risk for \nneurotoxicity or those who would like to avoid alopecia.  The \ndocetaxel/carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin/carboplatin regimens are \nboth recommended options in the NCCN Guidelines ( Table 4 ), and may \nbe considered for patients who are at high risk for neuropathy (eg, patients \nwith diabetes).798 \nRandomized trials testing platinum -based triplet or quadruplet regimens \nhave generally found that these do not improve efficacy but are associated \nwith worse toxicity when compared with platinum -based doublet s773,775 -\n777,779 -782 or single -agent platinum regimens.794,795 Examples of platinum -\nbased triplet and quadruplet regimens that have been compared with the \nstandard paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen are in Table 5  and 6. One study \nshowed that adding gemcitabine to carboplatin/paclitaxel actually resulted \nin worse PFS compared with carboplatin/paclitaxel alone  (Table 5  and \n6).780 Carboplatin/Paclitaxel Dosing Options  \nAs noted above, for postoperative first -line treatment of ovarian cancer, \nthe most commonly used dosing for IV carboplatin/paclitaxel combination \ntherapy is paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 + carboplatin AUC 5 –6, both given on day \n1 of a 3 -week cycle. As summarized in Table 7, multiple randomized \nstudies have compared different dosing schedules for IV carboplatin  and \npaclitaxel regimens as first -line postoperative therapy for ovarian \ncancer .757-761,763,799,800 Three different randomized trials (JGOG -3016, \nGOG -0262, and ICON8) tested “dose -dense” weekly paclitaxel dosing of \n80 mg/m2 combined with the standard carboplatin dosing (AUC 6, day 1, \nevery 3 weeks).758,760,761,763 JGOG -3016 results showed that this regimen \nimproved PFS and OS, GOG -0262 showed that this regimen improved \nPFS (in the subset of patients who were not receiving concurrent \nbevacizumab), and ICON8 found no significant improvements in PFS or \nOS (Table 7). All three trials reported increased rates of neutropenia and \nsigns of worse QOL  among patients treated with the dose -dense regimen.  \nTwo randomized trials (MITO -7 and ICON8) compared standard \npaclitaxel/carboplatin dosing with weekly paclitaxel (60 or 80 mg/m2) plus \nweekly carboplatin  (AUC 2), and found no significant differences in \nefficacy outcomes.757-759 MITO -7, which tested 60 mg/m2 paclitaxel, \nshowed higher rates of pulmonary toxicity, but  lower rates of neutropenia, \nfebrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, hair loss, and \nvomiting , and significant improvement in QOL .757 ICON8 , which  tested 80 \nmg/m2 paclitaxel , showed higher rates of neutropenia and carboplatin \nhypersensitivity reaction, and worse global QOL  compared with standard \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel dosing.758,759 Based on these results, if a weekly \nregimen is used, the paclitaxel weekly/carboplatin weekly regimen using \n60 mg/m2 paclitaxel is the recommended option (for stage II –IV disease ; \nTable 4 ).

MS-33 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nOptions for Stage I , Epithelial Cancer Types  \nMost of the patients had stage III –IV disease in randomized trials testing \nIV chemotherapy as postoperative first -line treatment for ovarian cancer. \nMore recent  trials allowed patients with stage II –IV disease, but only some \nincluded patients with select stage I disease ( Table 5 , Table 6 , and Table \n7). Therefore , the list of recommended options is much shorter for patients \nwith stage I disease, as summarized in Table 8, which  also shows trials \nthat tested the recommended regimens (last column). Patients wit h stage I \ndisease were included in randomized trials comparing IV \npaclitaxel/carboplatin (standard dosing) with single -agent carboplatin \n(ICON3),773 docetaxel/carboplatin (SCOTROC1),765 pegylated  liposomal doxorubicin /carboplatin (MITO -2),764 and weekly paclitaxel/weekly \ncarboplatin  (MITO -7 and ICON8).757-759 Of these, the first three are \nrecommended options for stage I disease in epithelial cancer types . \nPaclitaxel weekly/carboplatin weekly is more logistically challenging to \nadminister and is therefore not often used in the setting of stage I disease, \ngiven the lower risk of recurrence (compared with more advanced \ndisease) . Patients with stage I disease have also been included in some \nrandomized trials testing triplet or quadruplet regimens,773,780,795,796 but the \nadded toxicity of these regimens with no clear impact on efficacy makes \noptions inappropriate for stage I.\nTable 8.

MS-35 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nAdjuvant Chemotherapy Options for Patients with Advanced Age and/or \nComorbidities  \nAdjuvant systemic chemotherapy is considered an essential component of \ncare for patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal \ncancers.  For most patients with epithelial cancer types and stage I \ndisease, first -line systemic therapy generally consists of intravenous (IV) \nplatinum -based chemotherapy, with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin \narea under the curve (AUC) 5 –6 every 3 weeks recommended in the \nguidelines as a preferred regimen. IV platinum -based chemotherapy with \nor without bevacizuma b is also a recommended option for first -line \nsystemic therapy for those with stage II –IV disease. Additionally, alternate \nregimens (such as platinum -based IV/intraperitoneal [IP] chemotherapy or \nhormone therapy) are recommended as options, depending on cancer \nsubtype, completeness of the initial surgery, and stage of disease.

For \nexample, the dose of paclitaxel and carboplatin can be reduced. For \nguidance on how potential chemotherapy toxicity can be assessed , please \nrefer to the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology (available at \nhttp://www.NCCN.org ).  \nPrior versions of the guidelines recommended carboplatin monotherapy as \nan option for patients >70 years and/or those with comorbidities.

The hazard ratio (HR) for inferior overall \nsurvival of the carboplatin  monotherapy  group versus  the carboplatin -\npaclitaxel q3w group was 2.79 (95% CI, 1.57 –4.96; P < .001).  Higher \nincidence s of grade 3  or higher  thrombocytopenia and anemia were \nreported in the carbopla tin monotherapy group than  the carboplatin \ncombination therapy groups . In contrast, higher rates of low -grade \ngastrointestinal adverse events, neuropathy, and alopecia  were reported \nin the two carboplatin  combination groups.  \nDue to the worse survival outcomes associated with carboplatin \nmonotherapy compared with the  carboplatin -combination regimens, the \ntrial was prematurely terminated on the recommendation of the \nindependent data monitoring committee.812 Therefore , based on these \ndata, the NCCN panel no longer recommends  carboplatin monotherapy as \nan option for patients who are >70 years  and/or those with comorbidities, \nas carboplatin -combination therapy is  considered the standard -of-care \nfirst-line chemotherapy  regimen  for this population .   \nThe following regimens are recommended in the guidelines as options for \nthose  >70 years and/or those with comorbidities (OV -C 7 of 11):  \n• Paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 IV + carboplatin AUC 5 IV given every 21 \ndays for 3  to 6 cycles , depending on stage and cancer subtype810 \n• Paclitaxel 60 mg/m2 IV, followed by carboplatin AUC 2 IV on days \n1, 8, and 15, repeated every 21 days for 6 cycles757,812,813  \nThe latter option can also be considered for patients with poor \nperformance status.

MS-37 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nNumber of Cycles   \nRecommendations for the number of cycles of treatment vary with the \nstage of the disease. Panel members had an extensive discussion about \nthe number of cycles of chemotherapy that should be recommended for \npatients with advanced -stage disease. There is no evidence confirming \nthat more than 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy are required for \ninitial chemotherapy.  Early randomized studies showed that patients \ntreated with 8 or 10 cycles of adjuvant first -line platinum -based IV \nchemotherapy had similar survi val but experienced worse toxicity  than \nthose treated with only 5 cycles.814,815 For the regimens recommended in \nthe NCCN Guidelines (for postoperative first -line IV chemotherapy), most \nof the supporting phase III randomized trials tested 6 cycles of therapy \n(see Table 5 , Table 6 , and Table 7). Although cross -trial comparisons \nshould be interpreted with caution, the few trials that used greater than 6 \ncycles,776,777,781,782 did not appear to show better outcomes than those that \nused 6 cycles. Also, it has been noted that among the two trials showing \nimproved efficacy with first -line cisplatin/paclitaxel versus \ncisplatin/ cyclophosphamide  in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, the \nlater trial that allowed continuation beyond 6 cycles, up to 9 cycles \nreported a smaller treatment effect (on PFS  and OS) and had higher rates \nof neurotoxicity, suggesting that treatment beyond 6 cycles is unlikely to \nprovide  additional  clinical be nefit.791,792 One randomized trial \n(NCT00102375) showed that adding 4 cycles of topotecan after 6 cycles \nof carboplatin/paclitaxel did not improve PFS or OS, or even response \namong those with measurable disease ( Table 6).776 The phase III \nrandomized trial GOG -157 compared 3 versus 6 cycles  of \npaclitaxel/carboplatin as postoperative first -line IV chemotherapy for \npatients with  stage I –II epithelial ovarian cancer at high risk , defined as \nstage IA/IB with grade 3 or clear cell, or stage IC/II with any grade.801,802 \nFor the intent -to-treat ( ITT) population, the number of cycles did not have a significant impact on  relapse -free survival ( RFS) or OS, whereas 6 \ncycles was associated with higher rates of grade 3 –4 neurotoxicity, grade \n4 granulocytopenia, and grade 2 –4 anemia.801,802 After a median of 91 \nmonths of follow -up, exploratory analysis by cancer type showed that 6 \ncycles  (vs. 3) was associated with significant improvement in RFS for \npatients with serous histology  (HR, 0.30 ; 95% CI, 0.13 -0.72; P = .007) , but \nthis effect was not seen for any other cancer subtypes ( ie, endometrioid, \nclear cell, mucinous), and the number of cycles did not significantly impact \nOS for any subgroup.802 Based on these data the NCCN Guidelines \nrecommend 6 cycles adjuvant IV chemotherapy for stage I high -grade \nserous carcinoma, 3 cycle s for other stage I epithelial cancers, and 6 \ncycles for stage II –IV epithelial disease (regardless of tumor type).  \nToxicity  \nAll of these regimens have different toxicity profiles. The \ndocetaxel/carboplatin regimen is associated with increased risk for \nneutropenia; the IV paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen is associated with \nincreased risk of sensory peripheral neuropathy; and dose -dense \npaclitaxel is associated with increased  risk of  anemia and decreased \nQOL .760,762,764,765 Note that there are no agents to prevent \nchemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy.816  \nTargeted Agents  \nBevacizumab in the First -Line Setting  \nTwo phase 3 randomized trials, GOG -0218 and ICON7, tested the effects \nof adding bevacizumab during first -line platinum -based combination \nchemotherapy and as single -agent maintenance therapy after first -line \nchemotherapy (for patients who had not progressed  during initial treatment \nwith chemotherapy + bevacizumab).817-819 The study design and results \nfrom these trials are summarized in Table 10.\n  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Subgroup analysis \nshowed no treatment -dependent differences in OS for patients with stage III disease, but did yield interesting results for patients with stage IV  disease. Arm 1 a nd \n2 had no significant difference in OS, but Arm 3 showed significantly longer OS compared with Arm 1 (42.8 mo vs . 32.6 mo; HR, 0.75; 95% CI , 0.59–0.95).821 \ng Primary analysis of GCIG ICON7 after a median of 19.4 months follow -up showed improved PFS with bevacizumab (HR [95%CI], 0.81 [0.70 –0.94]; P=.004). Both \nPFS and OS showed non -proportionality, with the maximum treatment -dependent differences for PFS and OS between 12 –18 mo.818 \nh Regimen recommended in the NCCN Guidelines as an option for patients with newly  diagnosed stage II –IV, following cytoreductive surgery.  \n \nBevacizumab in the First -Line Setting: Efficacy  \nIn GOG -0218, although PFS was similar for patients treated with \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel (Arm 1, control) versus those who also had \nbevacizumab during initial treatment (Arm 2, \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab), patients treated with \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel /bevacizumab followed by maintenance with single -\nagent bevacizumab (Arm 3) had a 3-month  improvement in  median PFS \ncompared with the control arm (See Table 10A ).817,820 OS was not \nsignificantly different across all three  arms ( Table 10A ), even after long -\nterm follow -up.817,820,821 The effects of treatment on PFS and OS were non -\nproportional over time, however, with the greatest difference between \narms around 15 months, and the Kaplan -Meier curves converging again \nabout 9 months later. Results from ICON7 were similar, with results f rom \nthe primary analysis (median follow -up 19.4 months) showing longer PFS \nwith carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab, followed by single -agent \nbevacizumab maintenance therapy (Arm 2) compared with \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel along (Arm 1).818 Analyses after longer follow -up \n(median 48.9 months), however, showed no significant treatment -\ndependent differences in PFS or OS ( Table 10A ).819 Again the effects \nwere non -proportional over time, with the treatment -dependent differences \nin PFS and OS increasing to a peak between 12 –18 months, and the \nKaplan -Meier curves subsequently converging.819 \nFor both GOG -0218 and ICON7, outcomes with upfront \npaclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab plus single -agent bevacizumab \nmaintenance (Arm 3 in GOG -0218, Arm 2 in ICON7) were compared with control (paclitaxel/carboplatin alone, Arm 1) for a variety of patient \nsubgroups to determine whether there are particular groups of patients \nthat benefit from bevacizumab. Results across both studies showed that \npatients with features associated with poor  prognosis tend to derive a \ngreater benefit from the addition of bevacizu mab.817 Interim a nalyses of \ndata from GOG 0218 showed that bevacizumab improved OS in patients \nwith stage IV disease and in patients with ascites, another high -risk group \n(more likely to have poor performance score, high -grade serous histology, \nhigher median pre -treatment CA-125 level, and suboptimal surgical \ncytoreduction) ; however the final analyses did not show correlation \nbetween OS and ascites in the bevacizumab containing arms .820-822 For \nICON7, although after long -term follow -up (median 48.9 months) there \nwere no significant effects of bevacizumab on PFS or OS for the total \npopulation, subgroup analyses identified a high -risk group for which \nbevacizumab improved both PFS (median PFS for Arm 1 vs . Arm 2: 10.5 \nvs. 16.0 months; HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.61 –0.88]; P = .001) and OS (median \nOS for Arm 1 vs . Arm 2: 30.2 vs . 39.7 months; HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.63 –\n0.97]; P = .03).819 This high -risk group included those with either stage IV, \ninoperable stage III, or suboptimally debulked (residual disease >1 cm) \nstage III. Exploratory analyses suggest that stage may be more important \nthan the extent of residual disease for identifying patients who may benefit \nfrom bevacizumab.823 Although sample sizes were small, analyses found \nno significant impact of bevacizumab on OS for the following subgroups: \nclear cell carcinoma, low  stage high -grade disease, and low grade \nserous.819  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-40 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nAn exploratory analysis of GOG -0218, including 1195 patients with DNA \nsamples that could be sequenced, showed that the presence of mutations \nin BRCA1 , BRCA2 , or non -BRCA  homologous recombination repair (HRR) \ngenes was associated with longer PFS and OS relative to patients with no \nmutations in these genes, even after adjusting for treatment, stage, size of \nresidual disease, and performance status at baseline.824 For patients \nwithout mutations in any of these genes, the addition of bevacizumab (to \nup-front chemotherapy and as maintenance) was associated with \nimproved PFS (median PFS for Arm 1 vs . Arm 3: 10.6 vs . 15.4 months; \nHR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.60 –0.85]; P = .0001). This treatment effect on PFS \nwas not observed in the group of patients with mutations in BRCA1/2  or a \nnon-BRCA  HRR gene. These findings are consistent with those from other \nexploratory analyses suggesting that patients with poorer prognosis may \nderive t he most benefit from bevacizumab.824 Nonetheless, mutation \nstatus did not significantly modify the effect of bevacizumab on PFS, so \nthese data are insufficient to support using mutation status to identify \npatients who may benefit from first -line and maintenance bevacizumab.  \nBevacizumab Safety and Quality of Life  \nBased on earlier studies, toxicities that may occur in patients treated with \nbevacizumab and are of particular concern, may require intervention , and \noften lead to treatment discontinuation include the following: pain (grade \n≥2), neutropenia (grade ≥4), febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, \nbleeding (grade ≥2; various types), hypertension (grade ≥2), \nthromboembolism (grade ≥3, various types), GI events (perforations, \nabscesses, and fistulas), reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy \nsyndrome, renal injury and proteinuria (grade ≥3), and wound disruption. \nIn both GOG -0218 and ICON7, the following types of toxicities were more \ncommon in the bevacizumab arm: bleeding, hypertension, proteinuria , \nthromboembolic events (grade ≥3), GI perforation (grade ≥3) , and wound -\nhealing  complications .817,818 For some of these the difference between \narms was smaller than expected. Neutropenia occurred with similar rates across arms, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome \noccurred in GOG -0218 in only the bevacizumab arms.  \nData from both GOG -0218 and ICON7 showed that most toxicities \ndeveloped during the chemotherapy phase of treatment, although there \nwere a few AEs of concern that continued to develop during the \nbevacizumab maintenance phase, including hypertension, high -grade \npain, proteinuria, and thromboembolism.817 Exploratory analyses tried to \nidentify factors that might be associated with increased risk of \nbevacizumab -associated AEs.825,826 Analysis of GI -related AEs in GOG -\n0218 identified inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD), and bowel resection at \nprimary surgery as being associated with increased risk of grade ≥2 \nperforation, ﬁstula, necrosis, or hemorrhage.825 Another analysis of GOG -\n0218 reported that patients treated with bevacizumab had higher rates of \nreadmission, and noted that most readmissions occur within the first 40 \ndays after surgery but after the first cycle of chemotherapy was \ndelivered.826 Other factors associated with increased rates of readmission \n(across treatment arms) include baseline CA -125 level, disease stage, \nsurgery involving bowel resection, residual disease, ascites, high body \nmass index , and poor performance score. Whereas shorter time to start of \nchemotherapy after surgery was associated with increased rates of \nreadmission,826 time to initiation longer than 25 days was associated with \npoorer OS (across treatment arms).528 \nBoth GOG -0218 and ICON7 reported some small but statistically \nsignificant differences between treatment arms in the global measures of \nQOL . Analyses of GOG -0218 showed that QOL  improved somewhat \nduring the course of the study across all arms (FACT -O TOI scores \nimproved from ~67 –68 to ~76 –68).817,827 Results showed slightly worse \nQOL  for patients treated with bevacizumab during the chemotherapy \nphase (FACT -O TOI scores ≤3 points lower than for placebo; P < .001), \nbut this difference did not persist in the maintenance phase.817,827 There PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

For FACT -O TOI scores, the threshold for clinically meaningful \ndifferences has been suggested to be 5 –7 points. Results from ICON7 \nshowed that for both arms QOL  improved somewhat over the course of \nthe trial, during both the chemotherapy phase and the maintenance \nphase.818,828 However, these increases were smaller in  the bevacizumab \narm (Arm 2), such that QOL  scores were better in the control arm (Arm 1) \nversus the bevacizumab arm (Arm 2) at the end of chemotherapy (week \n18; mean QLQ -C30 score difference of 6.1 points; P < .0001) and at the \nend of the maintenance phase (week 54; 6.4 points; P < .0001).828 \nAlthough differences between the two arms (favoring placebo) were \nconsistently present and statistically significant, it is unclear whether they \nare clinically meaningful, as the threshold for clinical significance is a \nmatter of debate, and some have arg ued that it should be 10 points.  \nNCCN Recommendations  \nBased on results from GOG -0218 and ICON7, the NCCN Guidelines \ninclude bevacizumab -containing regimens as options for first -line chemotherapy following cytoreductive surgery  (Table 1 1). The regimens \nrecommended are those used in these trials that consist of upfront \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab, followed by bevacizumab \nmaintenance (shown in Table 10B , footnote h  and Table 1 1). In both of \nthese trials, treatment was discontinued upon disease progression, so the \nguidelines recommend single -agent bevacizum ab maintenance only for \nthose who have not progressed during the 6 cycles of upfront \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab ( see Post-Primary Treatment: \nMaintenance Therapy  in the Epithelial Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube \nCancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer  section of the algorithm ).

MS-43 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nGOG -0218 and ICON7 included patients primarily with ovarian cancer, but \nalso some with primary peritoneal or fallopian  tube cancer.817,818 These \ntrials mostly included patients with serous histology, but did include \npatients with other cancer types ( ie, mucinous, clear cell, endometrioid). \nTherefore, the NCCN recommendations regarding use of bevacizumab as \npart of first -line chemotherapy and maintenance apply to patients with any \nof these epithelial cancer types.  \nBevacizumab Biosimilars  \nIn September 2017  the FDA approved the first bevacizumab biosimilar, \nABP-215, as bevacizumab -awwb , for us e in certain indications in a \nnumber of cancers  (ie, colorectal cancer, non -squamous non-small cell \nlung cancer [NSCLC], glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer), \nbut not including any indications in ovarian, fallopian  tube, or primary \nperitoneal cancers due to regulatory exclusivity.829-831 This approval was \nbased  on data demonstrating that the ABP 215  is sufficiently structurally \nsimilar to bevacizumab, and functionally similar based on in vitro assays, \nin vivo assays (cell -based and preclinical models), pharmacokinetic data in \nhealthy adult men , and efficacy and safety data in patients with advanced \nNSCLC .829,832 -838 Approval in other cancer types was based on \nextrapolation.829,839 In 2019 the FDA approved another bevacizumab \nbiosimilar, PF -06439535, as bevacizumab -bvzr, for the same indications \nas bevacizumab -awwb.840 This approval was based on demonstration of \nstructural similarity, and data showing functional similarity including in vivo \nstudies, animal studies, pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and patients \nwith NSCLC, and efficacy and safety data in patients wit h NSCLC.841-845 \nSeveral other bevacizumab biosimilars are in development.846-860 Based on \na Panel vote, the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian state that an FDA -\napproved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for bevacizumab, \nwherever bevacizumab is recommended.  Intraperitoneal/Intravenous Regimen  \nIP chemotherapy has been explored as an option for ovarian cancer \nbased on the idea that localized delivery could improve efficacy, \nparticularly against microscopic spread and peritoneal carcinomatosis, \nwith an acceptable safety profile. Although results from smaller \nrandomized trials (n < 120) suggested no clinical benefit ( ie, response \nrate, PFS, OS) with IP/IV compared with IV regimens,861,862 three  larger \nrandomized trials (n > 400) in newly diagnosed chemotherapy -naïve \npatients  with stage III disease and residual disease 1 cm or less after \nprimary surgery compared IV regimens with IP/IV regimens using similar \nagents , and  found that IP/IV chemotherapy resulted in improved PFS \nand/or OS, with at least borderline statistical significance (See GOG -104, \nGOG -114, and GOG -172 in Table 12 ).724,863,864 One phase II randomized \ntrial (n  = 218) in patients with stage IIIC –IV epithelial ovarian cancer with \noptimal debulking also showed that IP/IV administration improved PFS \nand OS compared with IV only.865,866 Results from these trials suggest that \nIP/IV administration significantly increases risk of certain high -grade \nhematologic toxicities (eg, granulocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, \nthrombocytopenia), and certain non -hematologic toxicities (eg, GI and \nmeta bolic toxicities, renal toxicity, abdominal pain, neurologic toxicities, \ninfection, fatigue).724,863 -865,867 The increased risk of toxicity was considered \nacceptable given the improvement in OS, which was greater than a year  \n(16 months) in one of the trials ( Table 1 2).724,863,864 Pooled analyses of \nGOG -114 and GOG -172 data  showe d that the I P/IV regimen was \nassociated with lower risk of relapse in the peritoneal space,868 and long-\nterm follow -up (>10 years) s howed significant PFS benefit ( P = .01) and \nOS benefit ( P = .042), especially after adjusting for other prognostic \nfactors ( P = .003 for PFS, P = .002 for OS).869 This analysis also showed \nthat survival improves with each cycle of IP chemotherapy.869 Although the \nextent of residual disease was prognostic for outcome, IP/IV \nchemotherapy still provided PFS benefit even among those with some \ngross residual disease (>0 –≤1 cm).869 Based on these results, an IP/IV PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

In the NCCN Guidelines, the clear cell \ncarcinoma and carcinosarcoma are the only LCOCs for which IP/IV \nchemotherapy is a recommended option, as these cancer types are \nassociated with higher risk of poor outcomes .6,871 -873 Patients with \ncarcinosarcoma were not included in the randomized trials testing IP/IV \nchemotherapy, but 2 % to 6% of patients had clear cell \ncarcinoma.724,863,864,870 These trials included mostly patients with ovarian \ncancer, but in GOG -172, 12% of patients had primary peritoneal cancer. In \nthe NCCN Guidelines the recommended IP/IV regimen is an option \nregardless of primary site (ovarian, fallopian, or primary peritoneal ). All \nindividuals  should be counseled about the clinical benefit associated with combined IV and IP chemotherapy administration before undergoing \nsurgery.  \nEnthusiasm for IP/IV chemotherapy has waned considerably due to the \nresults of GOG -0252, a large randomized trial in patients with stage II/III \noptimally resected (≤1 cm), or stage III/IV suboptimally resected (>1 cm) \ndisease ( Table 12 ).870 Results showed that for combination therapy with \npaclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab, IP administration of the carboplatin \ndid not improve PFS or OS compared with IV administration ( Table 12 ).870 \nAn IV/IP paclitaxel/cisplatin/bevacizumab regimen also did not improve \nPFS for OS relative to the control IV paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab \nregimen ( Table 12 ).870 These results suggest that given the PFS benefit of \nadding bevacizumab (during chemotherapy and maintenance), IP \nadministration does not further improve outcomes.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  MS-47 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nFor the recommended IP chemotherapy regimen  (Table 13 ), the IP \npaclitaxel was infused over 24 hours  in the clinical trial (GOG -172).724 A \n3-hour infusion of paclitaxel has not been proven to be equivalent to a \n24-hour infusion, although a 3 -hour infusion has been reported to be more \nconvenient, easier to tolerate, and less toxic.874 Note that in all the \nsupporting trials and in the NCCN Guidelines, IP regimens include IV \nregimens so that systemic disease can also be treated.  \nThe IP paclitaxel/cisplatin regimen is associated with leukopenia, infection, \nfatigue, renal toxicity, abdominal discomfort, and neurotoxicity.724,863 -865,867 \nIn GOG -172, only 42% were able to complete all 6 treatment cycles of the \nIP regimen;724 with more experience, this percentage has improved in the \nmajor cancer centers.875 It has been suggested that a lower IP cisplatin \ndose of 75 mg/m2 may help to decrease toxicity .874,875 However, t he \nchemotherapy portion of the IV/IP paclitaxel/cisplatin/bevacizumab \nregimen used in GOG -0252 was very similar to the IV/IP \npaclitaxel/cisplatin regimen used in GOG -172, but with a lower dose of \ncisplatin (75 mg/m2 vs. 100 mg/m2), and did not improve PFS/OS relative \nto control ( Table 12 ).724,870 Therefore, it is unclear whether the IV/IP \nchemotherapy regimen with the lower cisplatin dose provides any benefit \ncompared with IV administration.  \nPrior to the administration of the combined IP and IV regimen, patients \nmust be apprised of the increased toxicities with the combined regimen \nwhen compared to using IV chemotherapy alone (increased \nmyelosuppression, renal toxicities, abdominal pain, neuro pathy, GI \ntoxicities, metabolic toxicities, and hepatic toxicities). Patients who are \ncandidates for the IP cisplatin and IP/ IV paclitaxel regimen should have \nnormal renal function before starting, a medically appropriate PS based on \nthe future toxicities of the IP/ IV regimen, and no previous evidence of \nmedical problems that could significantly worsen during chemotherapy, \nsuch as preexisting neuropathy. Reasons for discontinuing the IP regimen included catheter complications, nausea/vomiting/dehydration, and \nabdominal pain.876 Those  unable to complete IP therapy should receive IV \ntherapy. Expert nursing care may help to decrease complications.877 \nGiving IV hydration before and after IP chemotherapy is a useful strategy \nto prevent certain toxicit ies (nausea, vomiting, electrolyte imbalances, and \nmetabolic toxicities) .875 Prior to receiving and after receiving each cycle of \nIP cisplatin, adequate amounts of IV fluids need to be administered in \norder to prevent renal toxicity. After each cycle has been completed, \npatients need to be monitored carefully for myelosuppression,  \ndehydration, electrolyte loss, end -organ toxicities (such as renal and \nhepatic damage), and all other toxicities. After chemotherapy, patients \noften require IV fluids (5 –7 days) in the outpatient setting to prevent or \nhelp treat dehydration.  \nNeoadjuvant Chemotherapy  \nIn the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer, neoadjuvant therapy  refers to \ntreatment (eg, drugs and other treatment s) that is given to reduce the \ntumor burden before cancer surgery. The therapeutic benefit of NACT  \nfollowed by IDS remains controversial (see below ).480,694,878 -885 \nFor advance d-stage epithelial ovarian cancer, including fallopian tube and \nprimary peritoneal cancers, the best outcomes have been observed in \npatients whose primary treatment included  complete resection of all visible \ndisease and combination chemotherapy.868 Therefore, the NCCN \nGuidelines recommend that primary treatment for presumed advanced -\nstage disease  consist of appropriate surgical debulking plus systemic \nchemotherapy in most patients . For most patients pre senting with \nsuspected advanced -stage malignant ovarian , fallopian  tube, or primary \nperitoneal  cancer, initial surgery should include a hysterectomy and BSO \nwith comprehensive staging and debulking as indicated.13,541,588 PDS is the \nrecommended approach for advanced -stage disease if the patient is a \nsurgical candidate, optimal cytoreduction (residual disease <1 cm [R1] and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

NACT with IDS should be considered for patients \nwith advanced -stage disease  who are not good candidates for PDS due to \nadvanced age, frailty, poor performance status, comorbidities, or disease \nthat is unlikely to be optimally cytoreduced. The anticipated benefit from \nNACT would be to allow for medical improvement and/or clinical response \nthat would increase the likelihood of optimal cytoreduction at IDS. Patien ts \ntreated with NACT and IDS should also receive postop erative adjuvant \nchemotherapy.  \nRandomized Trials Comparing NACT Versus Conventional \nTreatment  \nSeveral prospective randomized trials have compared an NACT  approach \n(with IDS and postoperative chemotherapy) v ersus conventional treatment (PDS plus postoperative chemotherapy; Table 14 ).481-483,639,640 These trials \nfocused on patients with FIGO stage IIIC –IV ovarian , fallopian  tube, or \nprimary peritoneal  cancer that was deemed unlikely to be completely \nresected. As shown in Table 14 , the NACT regimens tested in these trials \ntypicall y consisted of 3 –4 cycles of up front chemotherapy, followed by IDS \nwith the goal of maximum cytoreduction, followed by 3 –4 cycles of \npostoperative chemotherapy. Several of these trials ( ie, EORTC 55971,483 \nSCORPION,639 JCOG0602482) allowed IDS in the neoadjuvant arm only for \npatients experiencing  response or stable disease after  NACT.

If serum CA -125:CEA ≤25, barium enema or colonoscopy, gastroscopy, \nand mammograph had to be negative.  \nc In EORTC 55971, OS P-value was for non -inferiority. Post hoc subgroup analyses showed that there was no treatment -dependent difference in OS for any of the \nsubgroups evaluated based on FIGO stage, WHO performance score, histologic type, or presence/absence of pleural fluid.483 Subgroup analyses showed that \nNACT was associated with better OS in patients with more extensive disease (stage IV with largest metastasis >45 mm diameter;  or stage IVB), and PDS was \nassociated with better OS in patients with less extensive disease (stage  III, ≤45 mm), and no treatment -dependent difference in OS in patients with an intermediate \nextent of disease (stage IIIC, >45 mm; or stage IVA).583,887 \nd In CHORUS, patients were included if suspected FIGO stage III –IV based on imaging/clinical evidence, but after surgery only 96% had confirmed III –IV; the \nremaining had stage II or unknown stage. For those with CA -125:CEA ratio <25 (2%), gastrointestinal c arcinoma had to be ruled out by imaging. Only patients in \nthe NACT arm had histologic/cytologic confirmation of diagnosis prior to treatment. Methods used for histologic/cytologic con firmation in NACT arm included: \nlaparoscopy (16%), image -guided biopsy ( 42%), and FNA cytology of tumor/effusion (41%).  \ne In CHORUS, analyses of subgroups showed that residual disease after surgery was prognostic for OS in both treatment groups. P ost-hoc subgroup analyses \nshowed that there was no treatment -dependent difference in OS for any of the subgroups evaluated based o n age, cancer stage, tumor size (prior to surgery), \nperformance score, or type of chemotherapy (single -agent carboplatin vs . carboplatin/paclitaxel).  \nf In SCORPION, patients with stage IV required to have pleural infusion or any resectable disease. All patients were required t o have a predictive index of 8 –12 and \nno mesenteric retraction. All patients had S -LPS for histologic confirmation and to assess t umor load (predictive index). The proportion of patients with poorly \ndifferentiated histology was not reported. However, 97% had type II histology per Kurman and Shih ,888 which includes conventional high -grade serous carcinoma, \nundifferentiated carcinoma, and malignant mixed mesodermal tumors (carcinosarcoma).  \ng In SCORPION, PDS was associated with a higher rate of upper abdominal procedures ( P = .0001), surgical complexity ( P = .0001), blood loss ( P = .003), and time \nbetween surgery and starting postoperative chemotherapy ( P = .0001).  \nh JCOG0602 did not require histologic confirmation of diagnoses at trial entry. Diagnosis was based on both imaging and cytolog y of ascites, pleural effusions, or \nfluids obtained by centesis.  \ni In JCOG0602, patients in the control arm were allowed to have IDS for residual >1 cm after PDS; and IDS was mandatory if uter us, adnexa, or omentum were not \nremoved at PDS, unless PD was noted. Of 128 patients in the control arm who completed the first 4 cycles of postoperative che motherapy, 49 had IDS. Outcomes \nof surgery in this table include results from all surgeries performed. Patients in the PDS arm had higher rates of para -aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy ( P < \n.001, P < .001), resection of abdomin al organ and distant metastases ( P = .012, P = .017), and transfusions of albumin or fresh frozen plasma (FFP)/plasma \nprotein fraction (PPF)/albumin ( P < .001, P < .001). They also had higher volumes of blood/ascites loss ( P < .001).  \nj In the study reported by Liu et al, 2017640, subgroup analysis showed that the following factors were prognostic for OS among patients in the NACT arm: tumor \nstage (III vs . IV), histologic grade (grade 1 vs . 2 vs. 3), residual tumor size (≤1 cm vs . >1 cm), and number of chemotherapy cycles.  \n \nAlthough there was some variability across these trials, results in general \ndemonstrated that patients treated with NACT had improved surgical \noutcomes ( eg, shorter operative time, less blood loss, fewer high -grade \nsurgical complicat ions or surgery -related AEs,  shorter hospital stay), less \nextensive and complicated surgeries needed to achieve optimal \ncytoreduction, and a lower risk of postoperative death ( Table 1 4).481-\n483,639,640 Most of these trials found that NACT increased the likelihood of \nachieving optimal cytoreduction and/or removal of all macroscopic disease \n(R0).  Although a n NACT approach was associated with improved surgical \noutcomes and less residual disease after surgery, trials that reported PFS \nand OS found no significant differences when compared with the \nconventional PDS approach ( Table 14 ). For some of these trials, post hoc \nanalyses were conducted to determine whether there are any subgroups \nof patients for whom NACT may improve PFS or OS.

MS-51 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nshowed that NACT (with IDS and adjuvant chemotherapy) may improve \nPFS and/or OS in patients with more extensive disease, but conventional \ntreatment (PDS and postoperative chemotherapy) was associated with \nbetter PFS and/or OS in patients with less extensiv e disease.583,887,889  \nImportantly, for some of these trials ( ie, EORTC 55971, CHORUS) the \nmedian PFS and OS for both treatment arms ( Table 14 ) were inferior to \nthose reported in randomized studies of patients undergoing PDS followed \nby postoperative IV chemotherapy for advanced disease  (OS mean, ~50 \nmonths in the United States).724,890 Although the median OS in the \ninternational trial is 20 month s lower than that reported in US  trials using \nthe customary sequence of therapeutic interventions (ie, PDS followed by \nchemotherapy), this difference may have been a result of selection of \nhigher risk patients in the NACT trials (which did not include patients with \nstage IIIB or earlier stages).  \nSelection of Patients for NACT  \nBased on the results from randomized trials shown in Table 14 , the NCCN \nGuidelines recommend considering neoadjuvant therapy for patients with \nbulky disease that is unlikely to be optimally cytoreduced by up -front \nsurgery. The panel considers the current evidence to be insufficient for \njustifying NACT  as an option for patients who by assessment of a \ngynecologic oncologist are likely to be optimally cytoreduced by upfront \nsurgery. When selecting patients for NACT  with IDS, the cancer type of \nthe primary tumor and potential response to primary chemotherapy should \nbe co nsidered. NACT  is not appropriate for patients with non -epithelial \ncancer types (eg, sex  cord-stromal or germ -cell tumors). NACT  is not \nappropriate for patients with disease apparently confined to the ovary. \nNACT  can also be considered for patients who are poor surgical \ncandidates, such as those with poor performance score, in the hopes that \ntumor load reduction may improve their condition and thereby reduce \nperioperative risks. At least one of the randomized tria ls in Table 14  (Liu 2017640) showed that among patients (aged 60 to 75  years ) with stage \nIII/IV disease, NACT  improved the rate of successful cytoreduction and \nother surgical outcomes (reduced operative time and blood loss), although \nsimilar to other randomized trials no improvement in PFS or OS was \nobserved.  \nNCCN recommendations for workup and selection of patients for NACT \nare aligned with the eligibility criteria and protocols used in the randomized \ncontrolled trials shown in Table 14 . For these trials, preoperative \nevaluations and debulking surgeries were performed by gynecologic \noncologists; some trials included additional requirements to ensure that \nthe surgeons had sufficient experience performing the procedures.481-\n483,639,640 The NCCN Ovarian Cancer P anel emphasizes that evaluation by \na gynecologic oncologist is important for determining  the most appropriate \nmethod of  obtaining tissue f or histologic confirmation and of  determining \nthe extent of disease. This recommendation is consistent with those from \nSGO  and ASCO.480  \nMost of the trials in Table 14  required confirmation of staging and \ndiagnosis based on imaging plus histology of a biopsy specimen or \ncytology of ascites or pleural effusion. Some trials had additional entry \ncriteria based on serum CA -125 and CEA  levels , and some required \nadditional diagnostic tests to rule out other types of malignancies. \nLaparoscopy to evaluate extent of disease and feasibility of resection was \nrequired in one of these trials (SCORPION) and also frequently used in \nthe other randomized trials shown in Table 14 . Reports from several of \nthese trials noted that for some patients , the assignment of histologic type \nand disease stage was revised after biopsy or laparoscopic evaluation, \nand sometimes revised after debulking surgery.481-483,639 The NCCN \nGuidelines recommend histologic confirmation of diagnosis and cancer \nsubtype based on analysis of tumor tissue.

Preliminary results from GEICO 1205/NOVA found that adding  bevacizumab to a standard carboplatin/paclitaxel regimen did not \nsignificantly change the rate of CR on NACT (prior to IDS), rate of “optimal \nsurgery ,” or PFS, but did show a lower rate of grade 3 –4 AEs in the arm \nthat included bevacizumab (70% vs . 42%, P = .026).895 The ALTHALYA PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-57 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \ntrial used a similar carboplatin/paclitaxel regimen, but did not find a \nsignificant difference in the rate of grade 3 –5 AEs for patients treated \nwithout versus with bevacizumab (63% vs . 62%).896 Results from \nALTHALYA also showed no difference between treatment arms for CR \nrate prior to IDS,  percent of patients with no macroscopic residual disease \nafter IDS, or surgical outcomes (operative time, length of hospital stay, \nlength of stay in intensive care unit , freque ncy of blood transfusions, and \nrate of postoperative complications).896 Taken together, results from these \ntrials indicate that although  platinum -based regimens that include \nbevacizumab have acceptable safety for patients treated with an NACT  \napproach, more data are needed to determine whether the addition of \nbevacizumab impacts PFS. The NCCN Guidelines include two \nbevacizumab -containing regimens as options for NACT and post -IDS \nchemotherapy ( Table 17 ). It is important to note that all of the prospective \ntrials in Table 15  and Table 16  that allowed use of bevacizumab in the \nNACT setting used a washout period before (and sometimes after) IDS, \nusually of at least 28 days.639,894 -896 Bevacizumab -containing regimens \nshould be used with caution before IDS due to potential interference with \npostoperative healing. If bevacizumab is being used as part of a \nneoadjuvant regimen, bevacizumab should be withheld from therapy for at \nleast 6 week s prior to IDS.  \nIntraperitoneal/Intravenous  Regimens for Patients Treated with NACT  \nSeveral trials have explored  the use of IP/IV  regimens in patients treated \nwith an NACT  approach. Both SWOG S0009 and OV21/PETROC tested \npostoperative IP/IV  regimens for patients who had platinum -based NACT \nfollowed by optimal cytoreduction by IDS.892,897 In SWOG S0009 , among \npatients with a 50% or greater decrease in CA -125 level during NACT, \noptimal debulking by IDS (<1 cm and malignant pleural resolved), and \npostoperative IP/IV  chemotherapy, median PFS (29 months) and OS (34 \nmonths) compared favorably with results from other trials using IV \nregimens ( Table 16 ).892 To determine whether postoperative IP/IV  chemotherapy improves outcomes compared with IV regimens among \npatients treated with NACT, the OV21/PETROC trial compared three  \ndifferent postoperative regimens ( Table 16 ) in patients previously treated \nwith platinum -based IV NACT (3 –4 cycles) and optimal cytoreduction by \nIDS.897 Although trends in the rate of progression or death in the first 9 \nmonths (from randomization) favored the carboplatin/paclitaxel IP/IV  \nregimen (Arm 3, 24.5%) over the cisplatin/paclitaxel IP/IV  regimen (Arm 2, \n34.7%) or the carboplatin/paclitaxel IV regimen (Arm 1, 38.6%), later \nresults (median follow -up 33 months) showed no difference in median PFS \nfor the IP/IV  regimens versus the IV regimen (Table 16 ). OS rate at 2 \nyears was also not significantly different (74% vs . 81% for Arm 1 vs . Arm \n3).897 \nBased on these results , the NCCN Guideline s include both the \ncisplatin/paclitaxel IP/IV  regimen and the carboplatin/paclitaxel IP/IV  \nregimen as options for postoperative therapy in patients who have \nreceived NACT and IDS  (Table 17 ). Given the lack of survival \nimprovement in OV21/PETROC, more data are needed to establish \nwhether postoperative IP chemotherapy provides clinical benefit in \npatients who have received IV NACT and IDS. Recent results from the \nphase III randomized controlled  GOG -0252 trial have als o called into \nquestion the value of postoperative IP chemotherapy for patients with \nadvanced -stage disease  treated with PDS.870 Although  earlier trials \nshowed improved PFS and/or OS with IP versus IV \nchemotherapy,724,863,864,868 results from GOG -0252 showed no \nimprovement.870 However, unlike previous trials, all regimens used in \nGOG -0252 contained bevacizumab, which may have compensated for the \neffect of IP chemotherapy administration.  \nNumber of Chemotherapy Cycles Before and After IDS  \nAs shown in Table 16 , results from the PRIMOVAR -1 phase II randomized \ntrial showed that treatment with 3 versus 2 cycles of NACT did not impact PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

For patients who se disease  responded to NACT and are \nlikely to have optimal cytoreduction, IDS with completion \nhysterectomy/BSO and cytoreduction should be performed. Those with \nstable disease after 3  to 4 cycles of NACT can consider IDS  (with \ncompletion hysterectomy/BSO, and cytoreduction) , but also should \nconsider either 1) switching to treatment f or persistent/recurr ent disease ; \nor 2) treatment with additional cycles of NACT (to a total of ≥6 cycles) , \nthen re -evaluating to determine whether to perform  IDS (with completion \nhysterectomy/BSO, and cytoreduction) or switch to therapy for \npersistent/recurrent disease . The option to continue on beyond 6 cycles is \nusually reserved for those who are tolerating therapy and have signs that \na response may be achieved, such as those whose CA -125 is continuing \nto fall. Patients who experience disease progression during NACT should \nswitch to the rapy for persistent/recurrent disease.  \nMost of the trials testing NACT regimens used at least 3 cycles of adjuvant \nchemotherapy after IDS, or indicated that the total number of cycles \nshould be 6  to 8 (Table 14 , 15, and 16). The NCCN Guidelines \nrecommend that regardless of the number of cycles of NACT received, \nIDS should always be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. For all patients \nwho undergo NACT plus IDS, a minimum of 6 cycles of treatment is \nrecommended , including at least 3 cycles  of adjuvant therapy after IDS.  Patients with stable disease  who are tolerating therapy may continue past \n6 cycles.  \nInterval Debulking Surgery  After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of \nInvasive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer  \nAnalyses of data from multiple prospective trials found that the extent of \nresidual disease after NACT plus IDS was prognostic for PFS and \nOS.481,483,640,893 As shown in Table 14 , 15, and 16, these trials reported \noptimal cytoreduction in 45%  to 91% of patients, with complete removal of  \nall macroscopic disease in 30% to 59%. Therefore, as with a primary \ndebulking procedure, ever y effort should be made to  achieve complete \nremoval of macroscopic disease (R0) during IDS . Maximal effort should be \nmade to remove all gross disease in the abdomen, pelvis, and \nretroperitoneum. NCCN -recommended procedures for IDS are similar to \nthose used in the trials listed in Table 14 , 15, and 16,481-483,639,892 -894,896 and \nsimilar to those recommended for PDS. As mentioned earlier , these trials \nrequired experienced gynecologic oncologists for preoperative evaluation \nand IDS.481,483,639,896 Some NCCN Panel members use online surgical risk \ncalculators to determine whether IDS is safe in a patient who chose NACT \n(over PDS) due to a medical condition. Examples include the Modified \nCharlson Comorbidity Index (score <2),899-903 ASA Physical Classification \nStatus (score <3),904-906 the Edmonton Frail Scale (score <3) ,907 and the \nACS NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator.908-910 It is recommended that a \ngynecologic oncologist be consulted and perform the surgery. An open \nlaparotomy including a vertical midline abdominal incision should be used \nin most patients in whom an interval debulking procedure is planned. \nMinimally invasive techniques can be used for IDS in select patients. \nPatients whose disease is  unable to be optimally debulked using minimally \ninvasive techniques should be converted to an open procedure. Prior to \nIDS, patients should be counseled about port placement if s ubsequent IP \nchemotherapy is being considered.

MS-59 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nAll interval debulking procedures should include completion hysterectomy \nand BSO with comprehensive staging. All peritoneal surfaces should be \nvisualized, and a ny peritoneal surface or adhesion suspicious for \nharboring metastasis should be selectively excised or biopsied. Suspicious \nand/or enlarged nodes should be resected, if possible. Removal of lymph \nnodes noted to have potential metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis \nshould be considered, even if the nodes are not currently suspicious or \nenlarged. An omentectomy should be performed, and additional \nprocedures that may be considered include bowel resection and/or \nappendectomy, stripping of the diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, \nsplenectomy, partial cystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial \nhepatectomy, partial gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal \npancreatectomy.  \nHyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy at the Time of IDS  \nHyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) is a technique in \nwhich chemotherapy is delivered in a heated solution perfused throughout \nthe peritoneal space. The rationale for hyperthermic delivery is that heat \ncan increase penetration of the chemotherapy at the peritoneal surface \nand enhance the se nsitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy by inhibiting \nDNA repair.911-913 Concerns about the inconvenience of delivery and \ntoxicities associated with postoperative IP/IV chemotherapy motivated \nresearchers to determine whether HIPEC could improve safety and QOL . \nAlthough raising body temperature carries substantial risks, methods have \nbeen developed for raising the temperature of the IP space with minimal \nincrease in the temperature of the rest of the body.  \nOver the past several decades a few randomized trials ( Table 18 )914-917 \nand numerous prospective nonrandomized trials918-931 have reported on \nthe use of HIPEC in patients with ovarian cancer. HIPEC methods have \nevolved over the years to reduce intraoperative and postoperative \ncomplications. Both “open” and “closed” abdominal techniques have been developed and tested in these prospective studies.914,915,917 -931 HIPEC \nprotocols used in these prospective studies usually perfused \nchemotherapy for 60 or 90 minutes (depending on agent and dose used) \nwith solution heated to achieve an IP temperature of 41°C to 43°C.914-931 \nThe duration and safety of cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC procedures \nvaried across trials, with median procedure time ranging from 300  to 600 \nminutes and median hospital stay ranging from 8  to 24 days.917-924,926 -931 \nExcessive blood loss was common, and in some studies , more than half of \nthe patients required transfusions. Intraoperative and postoperative \nmortality (<30 days from surgery) ranged from 0 % to 7%,918-925,927 although \nthe most recent trials all report no deaths related to the procedure.929-931 \nThe rate of complications from surgery vary across trials, with \nmajor/severe complications (<30 days from surgery) occurring in 9% to \n40% of patients.918-927,929,930 Studies from one center reported that \ncomplication rates decreased in more recent years compared with when \ntheir center first started performing debulking and HIPEC procedures.920,932 \nCommon major/severe complications  observed across trials include  \nvarious types of fistulas, abscesses, and infections ( eg, wound infection, \nsepsis, pneumonia, central line -associated  infection, intra -abdominal \ninfection), surgical wound dehiscence, bowel perforation, ileus, \nhemorrhages, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, pleural \neffusions, pneumothorax, and renal failure/insufficiency.914,919 -\n923,925,927,928,930,933 Many studies reported that additional procedures were \nneeded to manage complications.914,920,921,924,926,927,929,930,933,934 \nGiven the risks associated with HIPEC, prospective studies have focused \non using HIPEC immediately after debulking (as part of the same \nprocedure) in patients with high -volume IP disease (FIGO stage III –IV at \ndiagnosis or recurrence), particularly those with peritoneal carcinomatosis, \nwho are at risk for widespread residual microscopic disease even after \nresection to no visible disease.

Patients \nwith less extensive disease were excluded because they are less likely to \nhave widespread microscopic disease after debulking , and therefore the \npotential benefit is unlikely to outweigh risks of the procedure. Patients \nwith distant extra -abdominal metastases were often excluded from HIPEC \nstudies because of concerns that IP therapy would not be effective \ntreatment for extra -peritoneal disease.  \nOnly a few phase III p rospective comparative studies have tested  whether \nHIPEC improves outcomes for patient s with advanced ovarian cancer \n(summarized in Table 18 ). The most recent and largest (n = 245) of these, \nM06OVH -OVHIPEC, showed that HIPEC improved recurrence -free \nsurvival and OS in patients with FIGO s tage III primary epithelial ovarian, \nfallopian  tube, or peritoneal cancer who underwent NACT due to extensive \nabdominal disease or suboptimal PDS.917 Although the total procedure \ntime for debulking + HIPEC was longer than for debulking alone, HIPEC \ndid not appear to have any major eff ects on hospital stay (median,  10 vs. 8 \ndays)  or administration of postoperative IV chemotherapy ( ie, time to \ninitiation , rate of completion of all 3 cycles). Most important, no differences \nin rates of toxicity were observed between arms (grade 3 –4 toxicities: 27% \nvs. 25%) or in an y of the health -related quality -of-life metrics evaluated.  \nBecause of these positive results, the NCCN Guidelines now include an \noption to consider HIPEC at the time of IDS in patients with stage III \ndisease treated with NACT. Similar to the trial, which required patients to \nhave response or stable  disease after 3 cycles of NACT  and which treated \npatients with postoperative chemotherapy (3 cycles), the NCCN \nGuidelines recommend HIPEC as an option for patients who have \nresponse or stable disease after NACT (3 cyc les preferred, but 4 –6 \nallowed) and recommend  that all patients treated with NACT and IDS ( ± \nHIPEC) receive postoperative chemotherapy. Analyses of M06OVH -\nOVHIPEC showed that the effect of HIPEC was consistent across a wide variety of subgroups ( eg, age, cancer type, prior surgery, extent of \ndisease, laparoscopy before surgery). Therefor e, the NCCN Guidelines \nindicate  that HIPEC can be considered for all patients with stage III \ndisease for which NACT and IDS is performed, without any further \nrequirements for selection of patients. Importantly, HIPEC is not \nrecommended for patients treated with PDS (no NACT) based on in itial \nresults from a randomized controlled trial  showing that HIPEC did not \nimprove PFS or OS in a population of patients with optimal cytoreduction \n(<1 cm residual) after PDS or a fter NACT + IDS ( Table 18 ).916 In the \nsubset of patients who underwent  NACT and IDS, however, long -term \nfollow -up showed  a trend toward improved PFS and OS with HIPEC.916 \nIn most prospective studies testing HIPEC, the surgery prior to HIPEC was \nconducted with the goal of maximal cytoreduction (R0 resection) and \ninvolved TAH/BSO, omentectomy, and a variety of other procedures , \ndepending on the extent of disease. Optimal cytoreduction (residual \ndisease <1 cm) was achieved in most patients in these trials, and, in some \nstudies, was  a requirement for receiving subsequent HIPEC.914,915,917 -931 \nRates of complete cytoreduction (R0 resection) varied from 50% to 100% \nin these trials,918-920,922 -928,930,931 and univariable and multivariable analyses \nshowed that residual disease after debulking was the strongest predictor \nof OS. 918,919,923 -925,933,935 Therefore , NCCN recommends maximum effort to \nachieve complete cytoreduction during IDS, regardless of whether or not \nHIPEC is planned.  \nThe NCCN -recommended HIPEC agent is cisplatin , 100 mg/m2, as was \nused in M06OVH -OVHIPEC .917 Although this trial tested only one regimen \nfor NACT and postoperative chemotherapy (carboplatin , area under the \ncurve [ AUC ] 5–6 + paclitaxel, 175 mg/m2 body surface area [ BSA]), other \nstudies have used a variety of agents, and the optimal pairing of \npre/postoperative regimens with HIPEC agent has not been determined. \nThe NCCN Guidelines currently do not restrict the HIPEC PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Observation with follow -up is \nrecommended for patients who  had stage I disease at presentation and \nhave no signs of new disease. Recommendations for surveillance during \nobservation are in the Monitoring/ Follow -up section ( within the Epithelial \nOvarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer  section  \nin the algorithm ). \nFor patients who had stage II –IV disease at presentation, options following \nsurgery and chemotherapy depend on the success of these interventions. \nThese patients should be evaluated with imaging as clinically indicated to \ndetermine the extent of residual disease or progression and scre en for \nnew metastases. Imaging should include chest/abdominal/pelvic CT, MRI, \nPET/CT , or PET (skull base to mid -thigh).  \nPatients with persistent disease or progression during initial treatment \nshould be treated with second -line approaches (see Epithelial Ovarian \nCancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer:  Therapy for \nPersistent  Disease or Recurrence  in the  algorithm and Recurrent Disease  \nsection below ).936,937  \nFor patients with advanced -stage (stages II –IV) disease who , after primary \ntherapy (surgery plus chemotherapy) , are in complete clinical remission \n(ie, complete response  [CR], defined as no definitive evidence of \ndisease936,937), partial remission (ie, partial response  [PR]), or stable \ndisease, recommended options depend on the extent of their response \nand the type of primary chemotherapy they received ( see Post-Primary  Treatment: Maintenance Therapy  within the Epithelial Ovarian \nCancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer  section of the \nalgorithm ). These recommendations have been revised several times \nrecently due to emerging data from clinical trials , summarized in Tables \n19, 20, and 21 . These recent data and their impact on the \nrecommendations are discussed in the sections below.  \nBevacizumab Maintenance Therapy  \nAs described in detail in the previous section entitled Bevacizumab in the \nFirst-Line Setting , results from the phase III GOG -0218 and ICON7 trials \nsupport the use of single -agent bevacizumab maintenance therapy for \npatients with stage II –IV disease who experience response or stable \ndisease after postoperative chemotherapy with one of the \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab regimens  used in these trials (and \nrecommended by NCCN) .817-819 Based on these results bevacizumab \nmonotherapy was a recommended option for maintenance for patients \nwith stage II –IV disease who were in CR/PR  after a primary treatment with \nsurgery and one of the bevacizumab -containing regimens recommended \nin the first -line setting. However, due to results from subsequent trials \nshowing benefit from PARP inhibitors, as described below, bevacizumab \nmonotherapy i s no longer recommended for patients with BRCA1/2  \nmutations, but is still recommended as an option for patients who have \nwild-type or unknown BRCA1/2 mutation status  (in CR/PR after a \nrecommended  bevacizumab -containing first -line chemotherapy regimen) , \nas these patients have fewer PARP inhibitor options (See Table 23 ). \nPARP Inhibitor Maintenance Therapy After Primary Chemotherap y \nSeveral PARP inhibitor s have been shown to be active in recurrent \novarian cancer ,938-945 and have been FDA approved for multiple indications  \nin ovarian cancer  (summarized in Table 2 2); the corresponding \nrecommendations can be found in the NCCN Guidelines algorithm for \nPost-Primary Treatment: Maintenance Therapy  (OV-5), Therapy for PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

A subsequent subgroup analysis showed that the PFS benefit \nwas significant regardless of BRCA  mutation type ( BRCA1  vs. BRCA2 ).946 \nBased on results from SOLO -1, the NCCN Guidelines include olaparib \nmonotherapy as a maintenance therapy option for patients who have a \nBRCA1/ 2 mutation and have a CR or PR after completion of primary \ntherapy including surgery and platinum -based chemotherapy ( Table 23 ).  \nSOLO -1 excluded patients who received bevacizumab as part of primary \nsystemic therapy, so the efficacy of single -agent olaparib after \nchemotherapy/bevacizumab primary therapy  is unknown. Nonetheless, \nthe benefit from olaparib was sizeable and significant across many \nsubgroups analyzed .752,946 It is important to note that the effect s of \nmaintenance olaparib on PFS (70% improvement; Table 19 )752 are far \ngreater than the effects on PFS reported for the addition of bevacizumab \nto both upfront and maintenance therapy (<30% improvement).817,819,820 \nPFS curves from SOLO -1 show large separation between olaparib versus \nplacebo throughout the time course of the study (median follow -up, 41 \nmonths),752 in contrast to results from GOG -0218 and ICON7 showing PFS curves converging well before 40 months, even for the high -risk \ngroups shown to benefit most from bevacizumab.819,820 In addition, the \nexploratory analysis of GOG -0218 based on BRCA  mutation status \nsuggests that bevacizumab may not improve PFS in patients with \nBRCA1/2  mutations.824 The PAOLA -1 trial (described in the next section) \nsuggested that maintenance olaparib could provide PFS benefit in patients \nwho had bevacizumab during first -line chemotherapy.753 For these \nreasons single -agent olaparib is a category 1 option only for patients who \ndid not have bevacizumab as part or primary therapy, but is a category 2A \noption for patients who received prior bevacizumab , provided that they \nwere in a CR or PR after completion of chemotherapy  (Table 23 ). The \nNCCN Panel included a footnote to make it clear that data are limited on \nthe use of  single -agent olaparib after first -line platinum -based \nchemotherapy plus bevacizumab , but that evidence from other subgroups \nsuggests that it should be considered as an option for these patients.   \nOlaparib + Bevacizumab  \nThe phase III double -blind, randomized PAOLA -1 trial demonstrated a \nremarkable improvement in PFS (HR, 0.59) when olaparib (vs . placebo) \nwas added to maintenance bevacizumab in patients who have  a CR or PR \nafter first -line platinum -taxane chemotherapy plus bevacizumab for \nadvanced disease ( Table 19 ).753 Unlike SOLO -1, PAOLA -1 included both \npatients with and without BRCA1/2  mutations. Subgroup analyses showed \nthat similar to the SOLO -1 trial, for patients with BRCA1/2  mutations, \nmaintenance olaparib reduced the risk of progression or death by \napproximately 70%  (Table 19 ).753  A subsequent sub -analysis found that PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-67 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nthe PFS benefit of adding olaparib to bevacizumab maintenance was \nsimilar and significant regardless of BRCA  mutation type ( BRCA1  vs. \nBRCA2 ).947 Based on these results, maintenance with bevacizumab + \nolaparib is a category 1 option for patients who have a CR/PR after \ncompleting bevacizumab -containing first -line therapy, and single -agent \nbevacizumab was removed as a maintenance therapy option in this \nsetting.  \nPAOLA -1 also showed that adding olaparib to maintenance bevacizumab \nresulted in a smaller but still significant improvement in PFS for those with \nBRCA1/2  wild-type or unknown  (Table 19 ).753 Due to the smaller \nmagnitude of this effect, the NCCN Guidelines include olaparib + \nbevacizumab combination and bevacizumab monotherapy as category 2A \nmaintenance therapy option s for patients with BRCA1/2  wild-type or \nunknown  mutation status  who are in a CR or PR after completion of first-\nline platinum -based chemotherapy /bevacizumab  combination (Table 23 ). \nIn PAOLA -1 the population with out BRCA1/2  mutations was further \nsubdivided  based on results of MyChoice CDx (Myriad Genetic \nLaboratories), a proprietary tumor tissue assay that uses  multiple \nmolecular tests and combines several metrics (loss of heterozygosity \n[LOH],948 telomeric allelic imbalance [TAI],949 and large -scale state \ntransitions [LST]950 to determine the genomic instability score (GIS), a \nproxy measure for the presence of homologous recombination \ndeficiency .951,952 A GIS cutoff  of 42  was used to define homologous \nrecombination deficiency status  based on a prior analyses of a population \nof breast and ovarian cancer cases showing that this cutoff identified 95% \nof patients who had BRCA1/2  deficiency, defined as either 1) one \ndeleterious mutation in BRCA1  or BRCA2 , with LOH in the wild -type copy ; \n2) two deleterious mutations in the same gene ; or 3) promoter methylation \nof BRCA1  with LOH in the wild -type copy .953 Among those without \nBRCA1/2  mutations, the PFS benefit of maintenance olaparib was significant for those with homologous recombination deficiency (as defined \nby the proprietary assay)  but was not significant for those who did not \nhave homologous recombination deficiency  (Table 19 ). For this reason , \nthe NCCN Panel included the  following footnote relating to the use of \nmaintenance bevacizumab + olaparib: In the absence of a BRCA1/2  \nmutation, homologous recombination deficiency  status may provide \ninformation on the magnitude of benefit of PARP inhibitor therapy \n(category 2B).  \nOS results  from PAOLA -1 were not mature.  \nNiraparib Monotherapy  \nSimilar to the SOLO -1 results for olaparib monotherapy, t he PRIMA trial \ndemonstrated a remarkable improvement in PFS with single -agent \nniraparib (versus placebo) as maintenance therapy for patients with a \nBRCA1/2  mutation who were in a CR/PR after first -line platinum -based \nchemotherapy ( Table 19 ).754 Based on these results the NCCN Guidelines \ninclude single -agent niraparib as a maintenance therapy option for \npatients with BRCA1/2  mutations who have completed primary treatment \nincluding surgery and platinum -based first -line therapy ( Table 2 3). PRIMA \nlikely did not include many patients who had prior bevacizumab as part of \nprimary systemic therapy, so for patients with a BRCA1/2  mutation \nmaintenance niraparib is a category 1 option  for those who had first -line \nplatinum -based chemotherapy without bevacizu mab, and a category 2A \noption for those who had bevacizumab in conjunction with first -line \nplatinum -based chemotherapy ( Table 23 ).  \nUnlike SOLO -1, the presence of a BRCA1/2  mutation was not part of the \nentry criteria for the PRIMA tr ial. PRIMA included patients who did not \nhave deleterious mutations in BRCA1/2 , and results showed significant \nPFS improvement with niraparib (vs . placebo) for the overall population. \nSubgroup analyses showed that the effect of maintenance niraparib on \nPFS was still significant among patients without a BRCA1/2  mutation (HR, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-68 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \n0.71 [95% CI, 0.58 –0.88]) , although the size of the effect appears  smaller \nthan that seen in patients with BRCA1/2  mutations  (Table 19 ). Based on \nthese results, the NCCN Guidelines include single -agent niraparib as an \noption for maintenance therapy for patients with BRCA1/2 wild-type or \nunknown, provided they are in a CR or PR after completion of primary \nplatinum -based chemotherapy (without bevacizumab) ( Table 23 ). Given \nthe smaller magnitude of the PFS effect in patients without BRCA1/2  \nmutation, and that PRIMA likely included very few patients who had \nbevacizumab as part of primary therapy, single -agent niraparib is not a \nrecommended maintenance therapy option for those who have BRCA1/2  \nwild-type or unknown and received bevacizumab as part of primary \ntherapy ( Table 23 ). \nAs in PAOLA -1, in PRIMA the patient group without BRCA1/2  mutation \nwas further subdivided into homologous recombination deficient and \nproficient based on a GIS cutoff of 42 using the MyChoice CDx (Myriad \nGenetic Laboratories) .754 Results show ed that the PFS effect of niraparib \n(vs. placebo)  remained significant for the smaller subgroup of patients with \nhomologous recombination deficiency but no BRCA1/2  mutation, a nd was \nsignificant , with a trend toward smaller magnitude, for the homologous \nrecombination -proficient subgroup ( Table 19 ).754 Because of these results , \nthe NCCN Panel  chose to include the following footnote relating to the use \nof maintenance niraparib: in the absence of a BRCA1/2  mutation, \nhomologous recombination deficiency  status may provide information on \nthe magnitude of benefit of PARP inhibitor therapy (category 2B).  \nOS data from the interim analysis was reported ( Table 19 ), but it is \npremature to draw conclusions from those results.  \nVeliparib  \nThe phase III VELIA study design was similar to  GOG -0218 and ICON7 \nbevacizumab trials in that it tested the effect of adding  veliparib during \nfirst-line chemotherapy and as subsequent  single -agent maintenance after completion of chemotherapy.755 VELIA did not require that patients have \nCR/PR before receiving maintenance therapy ; they only needed to have \nabsence of progression during first -line systemic therapy (6 cycles) and no \nlimiting toxicities. Results showed that whereas adding veliparib during \nfirst-line chemotherapy did not significantly improve PFS  compared with \nchemotherapy alone , those who received veliparib during first -line \nchemotherapy and maintenance therapy had significantly improved PFS \ncompared with those who received chemotherapy  alone (with placebo \nduring first -line systemic therapy and maintenance; Table 19 ). Subgroup \nanalyses showed that whereas the PFS benefit from veliparib appeared to \nbe the greatest for those with a BRCA1/2  mutation, and was significant for \nthose with homologous recombination deficiency ( BRCA1/2  mutation or a \nGIS ≥33 on myChoice CDx assay), the effect was smaller and not \nsignificant for the subgroup without BRCA1/2  mutation and the subgroup \nthat was homologous recombination -proficient (no BRCA1/2  mutation an d \nGIS <33; Table 19 ). OS results were not mature.755 Veliparib is not \nrecommended in the NCCN Guidelines because it is not FDA approved for \nany indications. Nonetheless the consistency of the results observed in \nVELIA support the use of PARP inhibitors as maintenance therapy after \nfirst-line platinum -based chemotherapy, and suggest that adding PARP \ninhibitors during primary chemotherapy may not provide substantial clinical \nbenefit.  \nPARP Inhibitor Safety  \nTable 21  summarizes key safety data for the four phase III trials testing \nPARP inhibitor therapy as maintenance following first -line systemic \ntherapy . Across trials, PARP inhibitor maintenance was associated with \nhigher rates of a number of common non -hematologic AEs, such as \nfatigue/asthenia, nausea , and vomiting ( Table 21 ). These non -hematologic \nAEs tended to be low -grade and rarely led to study -drug \ndiscontinuation.752-755 PARP inhibitor therapy was also associated with \nincreased risk for a number of hematologic AEs, such as anemia, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Hematologic AEs were the \nmost common high -grade AEs (grade ≥3), and the most common cause of \nstudy drug discontinuation due to toxicity.752-755 Although rare ( ≤2%), \nPARP inhibitor therapy was also associated with risk of myelodysplastic \nsyndrome or acute myeloid leukemia,752-755 and is mentioned in the FDA \nlabels.954,955 Bevacizumab is associated with risk of hypertension ; in the \nPAOLA -1 trial , hypertension was a common AE and a common high -grade \nAE in both arms, although it did not lead to discontinuation.753 Across \ntrials , rates of high -grade AEs (grade ≥3) were higher for single -agent \nPARP inhibitor maintenance therapy compared with placebo . In PAOLA -1, however, there was only a small difference between arms in the rate grade \n≥3 AEs (Table 21 ), and serious AEs occurred in 31% in each arm, 753 \nshow ing that risk of high -grade /serous  AEs was similar for maintenance \nbevacizumab with versus without  olaparib. Rates of study -drug \ndiscontinuation due to toxicity were  higher with PARP inhibitor \nmaintenance therapy across all trials , including PAOLA -1, largely due to \nhematologic AEs .  \nIn the SOLO -1, PAOLA -1, PRIMA, and VELIA trials, t here were no \nstatistically significant differences between treatment arms in the heath -\nrelated QOL  metrics evaluated.752-755 \n  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

As illustrated in Table 23 , there are several key \ndiscrepancies between the FDA labels and NCCN Guidelines \nrecommendations.  \n1) The FDA -approved indication for maintenance bevacizumab is \nlimited to patients with stage III –IV disease, whereas the NCCN \nGuidelines include this as an option for stage II disease. The \nrationale for this is discussed below in the section on Selecting \nPatients for Maintenance Therapy, Disease Stage.   \n2) The FDA -approved indication for maintenance bevacizumab is not \nqualified based on BRCA1/2  mutation status. In contrast, the \nNCCN Guidelines single -agent bevacizumab maintenance is \nlimited to those without a BRCA1/2  mutation. The rationale for this \nis discussed above in the section entitled Olaparib + Bevacizumab .  \n3) The FDA -approved indication for olaparib/bevacizumab \ncombination maintenance therapy does  not specify that patients \nmust have had prior bevacizumab, whereas the NCCN Guidelines \nrestrict this option to those with prior bevacizumab, as there are no \nprospective randomized trial data to suggest that maintenance \nbevacizumab provides any clinical be nefit to those who did not \nreceive prior bevacizumab in combination with platinum -based \nchemotherapy.  \n4) The FDA -approved indication for olaparib/bevacizumab \ncombination maintenance therapy is restricted to patients with BRCA1/2  mutations or genomic instability, presumably based on \nthe results of the subgroup analysis in PAOLA -1 showing no PFS \nbenefit for those without homologous recombination deficiency. \nThe NCCN Guidelines include olaparib/bevacizumab combination \nmaintenance therapy  as an option regardless of homologous \nrecombination deficiency status , choosing instead to focus on the \nPFS benefit observed fo r the larger subgroup of patients without \nBRCA1/2  mutation (not further subdivided by homologous \nrecombination deficiency status) .  \n5) The FDA -approved indication for niraparib maintenance is not \nrestricted by BRCA1/2  mutation status or whether bevacizumab \nwas given in combination with platinum -based chemotherapy. In \nthe NCCN Guidelines, however, for patients who received \nbevacizumab as part of primary therapy, niraparib is a \nmaintenance option only for those with a BRCA1/2  mutation. The \nrationale for this is described in the section above entitled Niraparib \nMonotherapy .  \nWhen determining whether a patient is a candidate for maintenance after \nfirst-line therapy, and selecting among recommended maintenance \ntherapy options, it is important to consider the eligibility criteria and \ncharacteristics of the patient population enro lled in the trials supporting the \nmaintenance therapy options.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  MS-75 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nd After first -line therapy with bevacizumab, data are limited on maintenance therapy with a single -agent PARP inhibitor (olaparib or niraparib) for patients with a \nBRCA1/2  mutation. However, based on the magnitude of benefit of PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy for other subgroups, single -agent PARP inhibitors can be \nconsidered.  \ne FDA indication column indicates options consistent with an FDA -approved indication.  \n \nSelecting Patients for Maintenance Therapy  \nDiagnosis and Cancer Type  \nAs shown in Table 20 , the trials testing PARP inhibitors as maintenance \ntherapy after first -line systemic therapy enrolled patients with newly  \ndiagnosed, histologically confirmed ovarian, primary peritoneal, or \nfallopian  tube cancer . The FDA indications in this setting for olaparib, \nolaparib + bevacizumab, and niraparib all apply to cancers originating in \nany of these primary sites  (Table 22 ). \nAlthough most patients in the trials testing PARP inhibitor maintenance \nafter primary therapy  had high -grade serous histology (95%–100%), \nseveral of these trials ( ie, SOLO -1, PAOLA -1, PRIMA), included a small \npercentage of patients with high -grade endometrioid (2.3 %–2.7%), and a \nsmall percentage with other cancer types (1.5 %–2.3%; Table 20 ). The \nNCCN Guidelines recommendations for maintenance  options apply to \npatients with high -grade serous or grade 2/3 endometrioid  cancer types. It \nis not clear whether these maintenance therapies are appropriate for \npatients with less common epithelial ovarian canc er types ( ie, \ncarcinosarcoma, clear cell carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, grade 1 \nendometrioid, low  grade serous) . The FDA indications for PARP inhibitors \nin this setting are all for “epithelial” cancer ( Table 22 ). \nDisease Stage  \nThe trials testing PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy after first -line \ntreatment all required patients to have FIGO stage III –IV, and most \npatients had stage III disease (65 %–83%; see Table 20 ). Cases of stage II \ndisease at initial diagnosis are rare, especially among patients who have undergone complete surgical staging, so  there are little data and low \nprobability of future trials that will address the question of whether it is \nappropriate to use PARP inhibitors as maintenance after completing \nprimary the rapy for stage II disease. For this reason , the NCCN Panel \ndecided that the PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy options (ie, olaparib, \nniraparib, olaparib + bevacizumab) for patients who have completed first -\nline chemotherapy are recommended for stage III –IV disease , and  should \nalso be considered for patients who have stage II disease , noting that \nsupporting data are limited  for stage II . These maintenance therapy \noptions  are not recommended for patients with stage I  disease (Table 23 ). \nThe FDA indications for olaparib, olaparib + bevacizumab, and niraparib \nas maintenance therapy options after first -line chemotherapy are for \npatients with “advanced” disease, which is not cl early defined  (Table 22 ).  \nThe GOG -0218 and ICON7 r egimens for first-line platinum -based \nchemotherapy with concurrent bevacizumab followed by single -agent  \nmaintenance bevacizumab are  recommended in the NCCN Guidelines as \noptions for stage III –IV disease , and  the NCCN Panel recommends that \nthese  can be considered for patients with stage II disease . They are not \nrecommended for stage I disease . Use in stage II should take into \nconsideration that  GOG -0218 included only stage III –IV,817 and although \nICON7 included patients with high -risk stage I/II, sub-analyses showed the \ngreatest benefit from bevacizumab among patients with more advanced \ndisease, with no significant impact of bevacizumab on OS for patients with \nearlier stage disease .819 The corresponding FDA -approved indication for \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab followed by single -agent bevacizumab \nis limited to stage III –IV disease ( Table 22 ).

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  MS-76 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nBRCA1/2 Mutation Status  \nBecause BRCA1/2  mutation status is important for selection of \nmaintenance therapy in patients with stage II –IV disease  that respond s to \nprimary treatment, the NCCN Guidelines recommend screening for \nBRCA1  and BRCA2  mutations earlier in the course of workup and primary \ntreatment. Genetic risk evaluation and BRCA1/2  testing should be initiated \nas soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed histologically by evaluation \nof tumor tissue. Primary chemotherapy should not be delayed for a genetic \ncounseling referral, because  delay between surgery and start of \nchemotherapy is associated with poorer outcomes,528,958 and maintenance \nwould not be initiated until completion of platinum -based first -line \nchemotherapy , which takes (at least) 18 weeks . The NCCN Guidelines \nrecommend that BRCA  testing be performed using an FDA -approved test \nor other validated test performed in a CLIA -approved facility.  \nHomologous Recombination Deficiency  \nThere is consensus that the presence of a deleterious germline or somatic \nmutation in BRCA1  or BRCA2 confers a level of homologous \nrecombination deficiency that is clinically relevant to the selection of \ntherapy for patients with ovarian cancer. However, for patients with \novarian cancer who do not have a deleterious or suspected deleterious \nmutation in BRCA1  or BRCA2 , various molecular markers  and metrics \nhave been proposed to determine whether the cancer is associated with a \nclinically relevant level of ho mologous recombination deficiency. Different \nmethods and cutoffs were used in the PAOLA -1, PRIMA, and VELIA \ntrials .753-755 Because in PRIMA the study  regimen being tested improved \nPFS (compared with control) even among the homologous recombination \n“proficient” subgroups, but the same was not true in PAOLA -1 or VELIA  \n(Table 19 ), it is not clear whether the  assays and cutoffs used to assign \nhomologous recombination deficiency in those studies should be used to \ninform selection of maintenance therapy after first -line treatment. This is \nan area of ongoing investigation and as such, the NCCN Panel is not ready to recommend any particular approach for determi ning homologous \nrecombination deficiency in patients with ovarian cancer who do not have \na BRCA1/2  mutation . \nPrimary Treatment  \nAll four trials testing PARP inhibitor maintenance after primary treatment \nincluded both patients who had received upfront PDS followed by adjuvant \nchemotherapy, as well as patients who had received NACT with IDS and \nadjuvant chemotherapy ( Table 20 ). For trials with  reported data regarding \nthe types of primary surgery received ( ie, SOLO -1, PAOLA -1, VELIA), \nmore than half of the patients had upfront PDS , most of the remainder had \nNACT and IDS, and very few did not have any primary surgery ( ≤7%; \nTable 20 ). In these three trials , more than half of the population had \nsurgery resulting in no macroscopic residual disease after surgery  (Table \n20). In SOLO -1 and PAOLA -1, subgroup analyses showed significant  PFS \nbenefit from PARP inhibitor maintenance regardless of the type of primary \nsurgery (PDS vs . IDS) and presence v ersus absence of macroscopic \nresidual disease after primary surgery.753,946 Subgroup analyses of VELIA \nshowed PFS benefit from veliparib regardless of the type of primary \nsurgery  (PDS vs . IDS).755 \nIn contrast  to the other three  trials , the PRIMA trial required that patients \nwith stage III have either unresectable disease or visible residual disease \nafter primary surgery, and likely included more patients treated with IDS \n(vs. PDS), such that a much smaller proportion of the population had a \nsurgery that resulted in no macroscopic disease.  For PRIMA the data on \nprimary surgeries received and extent of residual disease after surgery \nwere not reported clearly.  The PRIMA report did not include s ubgroup \nanalyses based on type of surgery or residual disease after surgery, but \ndid show that the PFS benefit associated with maintenance niraparib was \nsignificant for both those with and those without prior NACT .754 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-77 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nIn SOLO -1, PAOLA -1, and PRIMA, most patients had at least 6 cycles of \nplatinum -based chemotherapy as part of primary treatment  (Table 20 ). \nBoth IV regimens and IP/IV  regimens were allowed in SOLO -1 and \nPAOLA -1.752,753 In the NCCN Guidelines, all the IV and IP/IV  regimens \nrecommended for neoadjuvant/adjuvant primary chemotherapy in patients \nwith stage II –IV high -grade serous or endometrioid disease include 6 \ncycles of platinum -based combination chemotherapy (See Principles of \nSystemic Therapy : Primary Systemic Therapy Regimens  in the algorithm ). \nSOLO -1, PAOLA -1, and PRIMA required patients to have CR or PR \nbefore initiation of maintenance therapy, and most had CR after primary \nsystemic therapy, although the definitions of CR and PR varied ( Table 20 ). \nSubgroup analyses in SOLO -1 and PRIMA showed that PFS benefit from \nsingle -agent PARP inhibitor maintenance was significant regardless of \ndepth of response (CR vs . PR) after first -line systemic therapy.752,754 \nVELIA did not require that patients have CR or PR after primary \nchemotherapy as a criteri on for receiving veliparib maintenance therapy, \nand did not report response rate for the overall population.755 \nThe NCCN recommendation s for maintenance bevacizumab and PARP \ninhibitors  apply to patients with a CR  (no evidence of disease) or PR after \ndebulking surgery and chemotherapy, including those treated with PDS \nfollowed by  adjuvant chemotherapy, and those treated with NACT, IDS, \nand adjuv ant chemotherapy . Maintenance therapy  is not recommended f or \npatients who have progressive  or stable disease on primary treatment; \nthese patients should be treated with recurrence therapy options as shown \nin Therapy for Persist ent Disease or Recurrence  in the Epithelial Ovarian \nCancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer  section of the \nalgorithm .  Maintenance Therapies No Longer Recommended  \nPaclitaxel  Maintenance Therapy  \nBased on  results from the randomized GOG -178 trial, paclitaxel used to \nbe a post -remission therapy option for patients with stages II –IV and CR \nafter first -line therapy. In patients with CR after initial 5 –6 cycles of \nplatinum/paclitaxel combination, those receiving 12 versus 3 additional \ncycles of paclitaxel sustained a PFS advantage (22 vs . 14 months; P = \n.006), although no significant improvement in OS.959,960 Longer \nmaintenance with paclitaxel was associated with higher rates of grade 2 –3 \nneuropathy and grade 3 pain.960 More recent results from phase III \nrandomized trials have shown that for patients with CR after first -line \nplatinum/taxane -based chemotherapy, maintenance treatment with \npaclitaxel (vs . observation) did not improve PFS or OS, and was \nassociated with higher rates of GI toxicity  and neurotoxicity.961,962 For \nthese reasons, the NCCN Guidelines no longer include paclitaxel as an \noption for maintenance therapy after primary chemotherapy.  \nPazopanib  Maintenance Therapy  \nPazopanib used to be a recommended post -remission therapy option for \npatients with stages II –IV disease in clinical CR after first -line \nchemotherapy. This recommendation was based on the AGO -OVAR 16 \nphase III randomized trial showing improved PFS with pazopanib versus \nplaceb o (17.9 vs . 12.3 months; HR , 0.77 ; 95% CI, 0.64 –0.91; P = .0021) in \npatients with FIGO stage II –IV and no evidence of progression or \npersistent disease (>2 cm) after surgery plus platinum -taxane \nchemotherapy ( ≥5 cycles).963,964 Pazopanib was a category 2B \nrecommendation for post -remission therapy because the FDA has not \napproved this indication,965 there was no increase in OS, and the safety \nprofile was concerning.964 Safety results from AGO -OVAR 16 showed that \npazopanib was associated with significantly increased rates of certain \ngrade 3 –4 toxicities, including hypertension, neutropenia, liver -related \ntoxicity, diarrhea, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and palmar -plantar PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

The NCCN Panel consensus \nsupported the removal of post -remission pazopanib as an option for \nmaintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy.  \nDrug Reactions  \nVirtually all drugs have the potential to cause adverse reactions while \nbeing infused, which can be classified as infusion reactions or allergic \nreactions , and can occur either during the infusion or following completion \nof the infusion  (even days later) .966-970 Drugs used in gynecologic oncology \ntreatment that more commonly cause adverse reactions include \ncarboplatin, cisplatin, docetaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, and \npaclitaxel.970 Drug reactions can occur with either IV or IP administration of \nthese drugs.971 Most of these drug reactions are mild infusion reactions, \nbut more severe hypersensitivity ( allergic ) reactions and life-threatening \nanaphylaxis can occur.971-974  \nSymptoms of (mild) infusion reactions include hot flushing, rash, fever, \nchest tightness, mild blood pressure changes, back pain, and chills  (Table \n24). Adverse reactions associated with taxane drugs (ie, docetaxel, \npaclitaxel) and biotherapeutic agents tend to be mild infusion -related \nreactions, are often attributed to cremophor in paclitaxel, and tend to occur \nduring the first few cycles of treatment (al though they can be seen during \nany infusion regardless of how many previous cycles were administered). Mild i nfusion reactions are common with paclitaxel  (27% of patients) ,975 \nbut mild reactions can also occur with liposomal doxorubicin ,976 docetaxel, \nor even platinum agents (ie, carboplatin, cisplatin).  \nAllergic reactions (ie, true drug allergies) are more common with platinum \nagents such as  carboplatin  (16% of patients) , cisplatin, and \noxaliplatin ,975,977 and tend to occur following re -exposure to the inciting \ndrug or less commonly at the completion of initial chemotherapy (ie, cycle \n6 of a planned 6 treatments).974 Symptoms of allergic reactions include \nrash, edema, shortness of breath (bronchospasm), syncope or pre -\nsyncope, chest pain, tachycardia, generalized hives/itching, changes in \nblood pressure, nausea, vomiting, chills, changes in bowel function, and \noccasio nally feeling of impending doom  (Table 24 ). Symptoms of allergic \nreactions may continue to persist after stopping infusion and/or after \ntreatment interventions. Patients who are at higher risk of developing a \nhypersensitivity (allergic) reaction include th ose undergoing re -introduction \nof the drug after a period of no exposure and following multiple cycles of \nthe drug during the first and subsequent exposures;978,979 those \nundergoing IV administration of the drug rather than oral or IP \nadministration; those with allergies to other drugs; and those who have \npreviously had a reaction.  Severe allergic reactions include those that \ncause shortness of breath, changes in blood pressure requiring treatment, \nand GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting ). Anaphylaxis is a rare type of \nvery severe allergic reaction that can occur with the platinum and taxane \nagents (and others less commonly), can cause cardiovascular collapse, \nand can b e life -threatening.972,973,980 Life-threatening allergic reactions \nsuch as anaphylaxis are distinguished from other severe reactions  by \nacute onset, generalized hives, respiratory compromise, and severe \nhypotension  (Table 24 ). \n  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Patients should be told \nto report any signs and symptoms of a drug reaction, especially after they \nhave left the clinic (ie, delayed  rash). Clinicians and nursing staff should \nbe prepared for the possibility of a drug reaction every time a patient is \ninfused with a drug. Standing orders should be written for immediate \nintervention in case a severe drug reaction occurs and the treatment  area \nshould have appropriate medical equipment in case of a life -threatening \nreaction.980 Epinephrine (intramuscular 0.3 mL of 1 mg/mL \nsolution/ EpiPen ) should be used for any patient experiencing hypotension (systolic BP of <90 mm Hg) with or without other symptoms of an \nallergic/hypersensitivity reaction during or shortly after any chemotherapy \ndrug treatment. In the setting of acute cardiopulmonary arrest, standard \nresuscitation ( advanced cardiovascular life support [ ACLS ]) procedures \nshould be followed.  \nManagement of Drug Reactions  \nAlgorithms are provided for management of mild, severe, and \nlife-threatening reactions ( summarized in Table 25 ).981 These drug \nreaction algorithms are also useful for patients with other gynecologic \ncancers (eg, cervical, vulvar, and uterine cancers) who are receiving \ncarboplatin, cisplatin, docetaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, or PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

The management recommendations depend on the severity of \nthe reaction and the type of drug that caused the reaction (platinum vs . \nnon-platinum [ taxane, liposomal doxorubicin, or biotherapeutic agents ]; \nsee Table 25 ). Typically, the infusion should be stopped for patients \nhaving a reaction.  The one exception to this rule is that  mild infusion \nreactions occurring during first exposure to a platinum agent may be \nmanaged by decreasing the infusion rate and administering a n H1 blocker \nantihistamine ( eg, diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine), and usually resolve \nafter stopping the infusion. Whereas H1 blocker antihistamine such as \ndiphenhydramine or hydroxyzine is recommended for managing drug \nreactions, regardless of severity, H2 blockers such as cimetidine and \nfamotidine are reserved for severe or life -threatening reactions. Corticosteroids are also generally reserved for severe or life -threatening \nreactions, but may be needed for mild reactions to platinum agents in \npatients with prior exposure, if symptom s do not quickly resolve after \nadministering an H1 blocker.  IM epinephrine is recommended for life -\nthreatening reactions, but may sometimes be needed for severe (but not \nlife threatening) reactions, or for mild reactions to platinum agents if \nsymptoms are not responding to other interventions. Life -threatening \nreactions require oxygen and nebulized bronchodilators, and saline bolus \nmay also be needed for  life-threatening reactions to platinum agents.  \nStandard resuscitation procedures (ie, ACLS) should be followed for \npatients with acute cardiopulmonary arrest.982-985\nTable 2 5: Drug Reactions: Management  \nSeverity of Reaction  Mild (infusion)  Severe (allergic)  Life-Threatening (allergic ) \nDrug causing reaction  Platinum  Non-platinuma Platinum  Non-platinuma Platinum  Non-platinuma \nPrior exposure  0 ≥1 ≥0 ≥0 ≥0 ≥0 ≥0 \nInfusion recommendation  \nDecrease infusion rate  x       \nStop infusion   x x x x x x \nRecommended therapy  \nH1 blocker antihistamine (eg, \ndiphenhydramine or hydroxyzine)  x x x x x x x \nH2 blockers (eg, cimetidine, famotidine)     x x x x \nCorticosteroids (eg, methylprednisolone, \nhydrocortisone, dexamethasone)   If needed   x x x x \nIM epinephrine   If needed   If needed  If needed  x x \nOxygen     x x x x \nNebulized bronchodilators     x x x x \nSaline bolus       If needed   \nIM, intramuscular.  \na Taxane, liposomal doxorubicin, or biotherapeutic agents . \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-81 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nRechallenge and Desensitization  \nRecommendations for rechallenge and desensitization depend on the \nnumber and severity of the previous reactions. Patients who have had mild \nreactions to a drug  may develop more serious reactions upon re -exposure \neven when the drug is slowly infused.975 Therefore, for patients who have \nexperienced a reaction to a platinum agent, consider consultation with an \nallergist (or qualified medical or gynecologic oncologist) for  skin testing \nand to evaluate sensitization and the risk for further, more severe \nreactions.975,981,986,987 Skin testing is associated with false -negative \nresults.988,989 In cases of prior mild infusion reaction to the first exposure of \na platinum or non -platinum agent , rechallenge may be attempted if the \npatient, physician, and nursing staff are all comfortable with this plan, the \npatient has been counseled appropriately, vital signs remain stable, \nemergency equipment is available in the clinic area, and  the patients has \nreceived premedication with H1 blocker antihistamine, corticosteroids (eg, \nmethylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone), and H2 blockers \n(eg, cimeti dine, famotidine).990-993 For rechallenge with non -platinum \nagents after mild reaction to first exposure, slower infusion rate should be \nused. Typically , a taxane infusion can be re -started at a much slower rate, \nand the rate can be slowly increased as tolerated as per the treating \nclinician’s judgment.975,994 Many institutions have policies that stipulate \nhow to reinfuse the drug if the patient has had a prior infusion reaction.  \nNote that this rechallenge with slow infusion is different from \ndesensitization. Desensitization refers to a process of rendering the \npatient less likely to react in response to an allergen , and can be \nconsidered an option for patients who have had drug reactions.970,994 -996 \nFor patients with allergic reactions, various desensitization protocols have \nbeen published.967,970,987,994,995,997 -1001 To maximize safety, patients may be \ndesensitized in an intensive care unit.970,998 Almost all patients complete \nthe desensitiz ation  protocol with only mild breakthrough reactions (about \n90%).970,999,1001 -1003 For patients with more than one prior mild reaction or any severe or life-threatening reactions —such as those involving blood \npressure changes, dyspnea, tachycardia, widespread urticaria, \nanaphylaxis, or hypoxia — the implicated agent should not be used again \nunless under the supervision and guidance of an allergist or specialist with \ndesensitization  experience . For those with more than one mild reaction to \na non -platinum agent, consider switching to paclitaxel (albumin -bound) \ndue to medical necessity (ie, hypersensitivity reaction),1004,1005 or consider \nswitching to docetaxel; however, there are no data to support switching \ntaxanes. Cross reactions have occurred and have been life -threatening. \nSome reactions to paclitaxel may occur because of the diluent , in which \ncase switching to albumin -bound paclitaxel could diminish future risks . For \npatients with hypersensitivity to platinum -reagents, data suggest that re -\nadministration  of platinum -based treatment resulted in hypersensiti vity \nreactions in approximately one third of patients, although non e were \nsevere (grade ≥3), and survival was improved compared with patients who \nwere switched to non -platinum agents.1006 \nIf a mild allergic reaction is suspected, and it is appropriate to administer \nthe drug again, patients should be desensitized prior to resuming \nchemotherapy even if the symptoms have resolved.968 Patients must be \ndesensitized with each infusion if they previously had a drug reaction.994-996 \nData suggest that an extended infusion schedule and use of \npremedication may decrease the number of hypersensitivity reactions to \ncarboplatin.978,1007   \nRadiation Therapy  \nWhole abdominal radiation therapy is rarely used for epithelial ovarian, \nprimary peritoneal, and fallopian  tube cancers at NCCN Member \nInstitutions. It is not included as a treatment recommendation in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Ovarian Cancer.

Dilator use can start 2 to 4 weeks after RT is \ncompleted and can be done indefinitely.1014 \nFollow -up Recommendations  \nRecurrent disease may be identified clinically (eg, pelvic pain, weight \nloss), biochemically (ie, elevated CA -125 levels), and/or with imaging. \nAfter the completion of primary surgery and chemotherapy in patients with \nall stages of ovarian cancer (or Fallo pian tube cancer or primary peritoneal \ncancer) who have had a CR, the standard recommendation is observation \nwith follow -up to monitor for recurrent disease. Recommendations for \nmonitoring are described in the algorithm and also apply to some of the \nLCOC  (see Epithelial Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary \nPeritoneal Cancer:  Monitoring/Follow -up in the algorithm ). \nChest/abdominal/pelvic CT, MRI, FDG -PET/CT, FDG -PET scans (skull \nbase to mid -thigh), and chest x -ray may be ordered if clinically indicated; \nimaging is done with contrast unless contraindicated.1015 -1018 Patients \nshould be educated about the signs and symptoms suggestive of \nrecurrence (eg, pelvic pain, bloating, early satiety, obstruction, weight loss, \nfatigue). Patients who have had fertility -sparing surgery should be \nmonitored by US examinations of the abdomen and pelvis if indicated; \ncompletion surgery should be considered (category 2B) after they finish \nchildbearing. For the 2017 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel added a \nrecommendation for long -term wellness care (see the NCCN Guid elines \nfor Survivors hip, available at www.NCCN.org ).  \nIf the CA -125 level was initially elevated, then measurement of a CA -125 \nlevel or other tumor markers is recommended. A multi -institutional \nEuropean trial assessed the use of CA -125 for monitoring for ovarian \ncancer recurrence after primary therapy.1019,1020 The data suggest that treating recurrences early (based on detectable CA -125 levels in patients \nwho are asymptomatic) is not associated with an increase in survival and \nis associated with a decrease in QOL .1021 Recommendations from the \nSGO state that use of CA -125 levels for surveillance is optional.1017 The \nNCCN Panel feels that the European trial has limitations and patients \nshould discuss the pros and cons of CA -125 monitoring with their \nphysicians. In addition, patients seem reluctant to give up monitoring.1022 \nOthers have discussed this study in greater detail.385,1023,1024  \nManagement of an Increasing CA -125 Level  \nThe care of patients in a clinical complete remission is somewhat \ncontroversial; this includes patients who are found to have an increasing \nCA-125 level (during routine monitoring and follow -up) but no signs or \nsymptoms of recurrent disease (eg, pelvic pain, bloati ng, obstruction), \nfollowing an evaluation including a negative pelvic examination and \nnegative chest/abdominal/pelvic CT scans.1025 Patients who have never \nreceived chemotherapy (ie, naïve to chemotherapy) should be treated \nusing recommendations for newly diagnosed patients, should undergo \nclinically appropriate imaging studies and surgical debulking, and should \nbe treated as previously described (see Epithelial Ovarian \nCancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer:  Primary \nTreatment  in the algorithm ).  \nRecurrence therapy refers to drugs, radiation, or other treatment that is \ngiven to decrease tumor burden, control symptoms, or increase length \nand/or QOL  for patients with recurrent disease. After the documentation of \nan increased CA -125 level (ie, biochemical relapse), the median time for a \nclinical relapse is 2 to 6 months. Data suggest that immediate treatment \nfor biochemical relapse is not beneficial; therefore, immediate treatment is \na category 2B recommendation in the NCCN Guidelines.1019 After \nbiochemical relapse, recommended options include enrollment in a clinical \ntrial, delaying treatment (ie, observation) until clinical symptoms arise, or PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Because tamoxifen \nand other hormonally active agents have a defined response rate for \npatients with recurrent disease who have progressed after platinum -based \nchemotherapy,1026 these agents are frequently administered to patients \nwho have only a rising CA -125 level1027 as evidence of tumor \nprogression.1028 Tamoxifen, other hormonal agents, or other recurrence \ntherapy are acceptable recommendations for this clinical situation \n(category 2B for all).  \nRecurrent Disease  \nThe prognosis is poor either 1) for patients who progress after 2 \nconsecutive chemotherapy regimens without ever sustaining a clinical \nbenefit (refractory);1029 or 2) for those whose disease recurs in less than 6 \nmonths (platinum resistant). Note that progression is typically defined \nusing RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor) criteria.936,937 \nPanel members emphasized the importance of clinical trials to identify \nagents active in this group of patients.1030,1031 Because their disease was \nresistant to the primary induction regimen, retreatment with a platinum \ncompound or paclitaxel is not generally recommended. Although panel \nmembers do not recommend retreatment with platinum agents, they \nrecognize that altering t he schedule of paclitaxel may produce secondary \nresponses.1032,1033  Before any drug is given in the recurrent setting, the \nclinician should be familiar with the drug’s metabolism and should make \ncertain that the patient is an appropriate candidate for the drug (eg, that \nthe patient has adequate renal or hepatic function). Clinical judgment must \nbe used when selecting postoperative chemotherapy.  \nOptions for patients with platinum -resistant disease or for those with \nstages II to IV disease who have a PR include clinical trial, recurrence \ntherapy (see Principles of Systemic Therapy:  Acceptable Recurrence Therapies  for Epithelial Ovarian Cancer [including LCOC]/Fallopian \nTube/Primary Peritoneal Cancer  in the algorithm ),1034 and/or best \nsupportive care (see NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). Although palliative care is appropriate at many stages \nduring the disease course, an assessment for palliative care is especially \nappropriate for those  with platinum -resistant disease who may be \nreceiving continuous systemic therapy. Patients who relapse 6 months or \nmore after initial chemotherapy are termed platinum sensitive .1035,1036 \nCombination platinum -based chemotherapy for a total of 6 cycles is \npreferred for first recurrence (category 1) in patients with \nplatinum -sensitive disease (see Epithelial Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube \nCancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer:  Therapy for Persistent Disease or \nRecurrence  in the algorithm ); other recurrence therapies are also an \noption.1036,1037 Possible regimens are discussed in the following section \n(see Acceptable Recurrence Modalities in this Discussion).  \nPatients with ovarian cancer will often be retreated with multiple courses of \nrecurrence therapy. Caution should be used in patients who receive \nmultiple sequential courses of chemotherapy, because they may \nexperience excessive toxicity and may not be able  to tolerate doses used \nfor first -line recurrence therapy; thus, clinical judgment should be used \nwhen selecting doses (see Principles of Systemic Therapy  in the \nalgorithm ). Potential ancillary palliative, surgical, and/or supportive care \nprocedures for se lected patients are summarized in the algorithm (see \nPrinciples of Surgery  in the algorithm ).1038 -1043 Secondary cytoreductive \nsurgery can be considered for patients who recur (ie, radiographic and/or \nclinical relapse) after a long disease -free interval (6 months or \nmore).694,1044 -1049 A meta -analysis suggests that survival increases for \npatients with recurrent disease who have complete debulking.696 The \nduration of the disease -free interval has not been established, although \npanel members agreed that it should be at least 6 months before surgery \nis considered.588,1050  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-84 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nAlthough chemotherapy/resistance assays and/or other biomarker assays \nare being used in some NCCN Member Institutions to aid in selecting \nchemotherapy in situations where multiple equivalent chemotherapy \noptions are available; the current level of evidence  (category 3) is not \nsufficient to supplant standard -of-care chemotherapy.1051,1052 The NCCN \nPanel feels that in vitro chemosensitivity testing to choose a chemotherapy \nregimen for recurrent disease situations should not be recommended \n(category 3), owing to the lack of demonstrable efficacy for such an \napproach. ASCO also does not recom mend use of chemotherapy \nsensitivity and resistance assays, unless in a clinical trial setting.1053 Note \nthat a category 3 recommendation reflects strong disagreement about the \nintervention. At least 3 different NCCN Member Institutions must agree to \ninclude the category 3 intervention in the guideline, otherwise it is deleted.  \nRegardless of which regimen is selected initially, reevaluation should \nfollow after 2 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy (depending on the agent) to \ndetermine if patients benefited from chemotherapy. Patients who primarily \nprogress on 2 consecutive chemotherapy r egimens without evidence of \nclinical benefit may not benefit from additional therapy.1029 Decisions to \noffer supportive care, additional therapy, or clinical trials should be made \non a highly individual basis. Localized RT can also provide effective \npalliation when radiation ports are tailored to specific symptomatic disease \nsites.1008,1009  \nAcceptable Recurrence Modalities  \nThe NCCN Panel feels that no single therapeutic agent should be \ncurrently recommended as the treatment of choice for recurrent ovarian \ncarcinoma. Some regimens and agents are preferred based on expert \nopinion primarily for reasons of decreased toxicity and /or marginally \nincreased effectiveness (see Principles of Systemic Therapy : Acceptable \nRecurrence Therapies  for Epithelial Ovarian (including LCOC)/Fallopian \nTube/Primary Peritoneal Cancer  in the algorithm ).877 A meta -analysis of chemotherapy for recurrent ovarian cancer was published in 2007.1035 \nRecurrence therapy refers to therapy (eg, drugs, radiation, or other \ntreatment) that is given for recurrent cancer to control symptoms and \nincrease length or QOL  for clinical, biochemical, or radiographic evidence \nof recurrent cancer following initial treatment.  \nPreferred Therapies  \nThe consensus of the NCCN Panel for the treatment of recurrent disease \nis summarized in the algorithm (see Principles of Systemic Therapy : \nAcceptable Recurrence Therapies for Epithelial Ovarian (including \nLCOC)/Fallopian Tube/Primary Peritoneal Cancer in the algorithm ). \nPlatinum -based combination chemotherapy is recommended (category 1) \nfor a total of 6 cycles for platinum -sensitive recurrence (see Epithelial \nOvarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer:  \nTherapy for Persistent Disease or Recurrence  in the algorithm ).1035,1036 For \npatients with platinum -sensitive disease who cannot tolerate combination \ntherapy, the preferred single agent is carboplatin or cisplatin.1036,1054,1055 \nPreferred combinations for platinum -sensitive recurrent disease include \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel (category 1),1036 carboplatin/liposomal doxorubicin \n(category 1),1056 -1058 carboplatin/weekly paclitaxel,760 \ncarboplatin/albumin -bound paclitaxel (for taxane hypersensitivity), \ncarboplatin/docetaxel,1059,1060 carboplatin/gemcitabine (which has been \nshown to improve PFS),1036,1054,1055 cisplatin/gemcitabine, or \ncarboplatin/gemcitabine/bevacizumab.1054  \nThe category 1 recommendation for carboplatin/liposomal doxorubicin is \nbased on recent data and uniform consensus from the panel.1056,1057,1061 -\n1064 Carboplatin/liposomal doxorubicin is equivalent to \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel but has a different toxicity profile. \nCarboplatin/liposomal doxorubicin is easier to tolerate; patients  tend to \ndiscontinue therapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel more often than they do \nwith carboplatin/liposomal doxorubicin.

MS-85 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nincluding those with bevacizumab, are discussed in the following \nparagraphs. For the 2017 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel added a \nrecommendation (category 2A) for carboplatin/albumin -bound paclitaxel as \nrecurrence therapy for those  with platinum -sensitive disease and \nconfirmed taxane hypersensitivity. Preliminary data from a phase 2 study \nof carboplatin/nab -paclitaxel in platinum -sensitive patients indicated that \nthe overall response rate was 79%; 39% (15/38) of patients had a CR \nrate.1065 A recent study of carboplatin/albumin -bound paclitaxel in patients \nwith gynecologic tumors included 22 patients with ovarian cancer; the \nregimen was well tolerated and no patients had hypersensitivity \nreactions.1005  \nFor platinum -resistant disease, non -platinum –based agents or regimens \nare preferred (ie, docetaxel, oral etoposide, gemcitabine, weekly paclitaxel \nwith or without pazopanib, liposomal doxorubicin with or without \nbevacizumab, weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab, topotecan with or without \nbevacizumab); sequential therapy using single agents is typically \nused.943,1066 A phase 2 trial (MITO -11) assessed weekly paclitaxel with (or \nwithout) pazopanib in patients with platinum -resistant or refractory \nadvanced ovarian cancer.1066 The data show that PFS was increased in \nthe paclitaxel/pazopanib arm when compared with paclitaxel alone \n(median 6.35 months [95% CI, 5.36 –11.02] vs. 3.49 months [2.01 –5.66]; \nHR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.25 –0.69]; P = .0002). Combination regimens with \nbevacizumab (AURELIA trial) are described later in this section (see \nBevacizumab  in this Discussion). Combination therapy is not preferred \nover single -agent therapy for platinum -resistant disease. For the 2017 \nupdate (Version 2), the NCCN Panel clarified this point by  adding a \nfootnote stating that the panel recommends combination, platinum -based \nregimens for platinum -sensitive recurrent disease, especially first relapses.  \nThe response rate of the following agents appears to be similar: \ntopotecan, 20%;1067 gemcitabine, 19%;1068,1069 liposomal doxorubicin, 26%;1068 -1070 and oral etoposide, 27%.1071 In patients with \nplatinum -resistant disease, the response rate for docetaxel is 22% and for \nweekly paclitaxel is 21%.1032,1072,1073 Reports suggest that weekly \ntopotecan is less toxic than the daily regimen.1074,1075 Palliative \nchemotherapy has been shown to reduce symptoms in patients with \nplatinum -resistant disease.1076  \nOther Potentially Active Agents  \nOther potentially active agents include altretamine, capecitabine, \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, melphalan, \noxaliplatin, paclitaxel, nanoparticle albumin -bound paclitaxel \n(nab-paclitaxel), pemetrexed, and vinorelbine (see Principles of Systemic \nTherapy : Acceptable Recurrence Therapies  for Epithelial Ovarian \n(including LCOC)/Fallopian Tube/Primary Peritoneal Cancer  in the \nalgorithm ).1073,1077 -1081 Nab-paclitaxel has an overall response rate of \n64%.1082 Vinorelbine has a response rate of 20%.1083,1084 Altretamine has a \n14% response rate1085 and ifosfamide has a 12% response rate,1086 \nalthough less information is available regarding their use in patients with \npaclitaxel -refractory disease. In those  with platinum -resistant disease, the \nresponse rate for pemetrexed is 21%.1032,1072,1073 Single -agent paclitaxel, \nnab-paclitaxel, and oxaliplatin can be used in appropriate \npatients.959,1036,1072,1087 Capecitabine has activity if disease was resistant to \nplatinum and taxanes.1088 Other alkylating agents, including \ncyclophosphamide and melphalan, can also be used.783,791 In addition, \nhormonal therapy with tamoxifen or other agents including aromatase \ninhibitors (such as anastrozole and letrozole), leuprolide acetate, or \nmegestrol acetate continues to be a viable therapeutic option for patients \nwho cannot tolerate or those whose disease have not responded to \ncytotoxic regimens.1089 -1095 Studies are ongoing for new agents to treat \nplatinum -resistant disease.1096 The NCCN Panel also recommends \n(category 2B) single -agent pazopanib as a potentially active targeted \nrecurrence therapy in patients who had a CR to initial therapy.1097 In a PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

The NCCN Panel added another footnote to clarify that \nbevacizumab can be continued as single -agent maintenance therapy until \ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity if the disease  respond s to the \ninitial recurrence chemotherapy/bevacizumab regimens described in the \nfollowing paragraphs (see Principles of Systemic Therapy : Acceptable \nRecurrence Therapies for Epithelial Ovarian (including LCOC)/Fallopian \nTube/Primary Peritoneal Cancer  in the algorithm ).  \nSeveral phase 3 randomized trials have assessed combination therapy \nwith bevacizumab for recurrent ovarian cancer (ie, AURELIA, \nOCEANS).1104,1105 The AURELIA trial assessed bevacizumab combined \nwith chemotherapy —either liposomal doxorubicin, weekly paclitaxel, or \ntopotecan —versus chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced \nplatinum -resistant ovarian cancer. For patients receiving \nbevacizumab/chemo therapy, the primary endpoint of PFS was 6.7 months \nversus 3.4 months with chemotherapy alone. The median OS was 16.6 months for the bevacizumab/chemotherapy arm versus 13.3 months for \nchemotherapy alone; the OS HR was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.66 –1.08; P < .174). \nHypertension and proteinuria (≥ grade 2) were more common with \nbevacizumab. GI perforation occurred in 2.2% of patients on the \nbevacizumab arm. Based on the results of the AURELIA trial, the NCCN \nPanel recommends the following combination regimens for patients with \nplatinum -resistant recurrent ovarian cancer: weekly \npaclitaxel/bevaci zumab, liposomal doxorubicin/bevacizumab, and \ntopotecan/bevacizumab.1104,1106  \nA phase 3 randomized trial (OCEANS) assessed carboplatin/gemcitabine \nwith and without bevacizumab in patients with platinum -sensitive recurrent \novarian cancer who had not previously received bevacizumab. In the \nOCEANS trial, PFS was increased in patients r eceiving the \nchemotherapy/bevacizumab arm when compared with chemotherapy \nalone (12.4 vs. 8.4 months, P < .0001).1105 The final survival analysis did \nnot show an increase in OS with the chemotherapy/bevacizumab arm \nwhen compared with chemotherapy alone (bevacizumab/chemotherapy: \n33.6 months; chemotherapy alone: 32.9 months; HR, 0.95; P = .65).1107 GI \nperforation occurred in 2 patients in the chemotherapy/bevacizumab arm. \nOne patient died from intracranial hemorrhage in the \nchemotherapy/bevacizumab arm. For the 2017 update, the NCCN Panel \nrevised the recommendation for carboplatin/gemcitabine/bevacizuma b to \ncategory 2A (from category 2B) based on clinical experience. However, \ncategory 1 combination regimens are recommended over this \nbevacizumab regimen. The carboplatin/gemcitabine/bevacizumab regimen \nis not recommended in patients who are at risk for  GI perforation.  \nA recent phase 3 randomized trial (GOG -0213) assessed recurrence \ncombination therapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab in patients \nwith platinum -sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.1108 Those  receiving \nchemotherapy/bevacizumab had slightly increased median OS when PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-87 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \ncompared with chemotherapy alone (42.2 months [95% CI, 37.7 –46.2) \nversus 37.3 months (32.6 –39.7) (HR, 0.829; 95% CI, 0.683 –1.005; \nP=.056). Most patients in both arms had at least one grade 3 or worse AE; \n96% (317/325) of patients in the chemotherapy/bevacizumab group versus \n86% (282/332) with chemotherapy alone; the most common of these AEs \nwere hypertension, fatigue, and proteinuria. Nine (3%) treatment -related \ndeaths occurred in the bevacizumab arm versus 2 (1%) deaths in the \nchemotherapy alone arm. For t he 2017 update, the NCCN panel added \ncarboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab as a potentially active regimen based \non this trial.  \nPARP Inhibitors  \nOlaparib  \nData suggest that olaparib (AZD2281), which is a PARP inhibitor, is active \nin select patients (those with BRCA1  and BRCA2  mutations have higher \nresponse rates than those who are BRCA  negative), especially those with \nplatinum -sensitive disease.938-943 If disease is resistant or refractory to \nplatinum, then a lower response rate to olaparib is observed.939,941 A trial \nassessed olaparib in individuals  with recurrent advanced ovarian cancer; \nthe overall response rate was 34% ( CR, 2%; and PR, 32%).1109,1110 The \nFDA approved olaparib for patients with advanced ovarian cancer who \nhave received treatment with 3 or more lines of chemotherapy and who \nhave a germline BRCA mutation.1110,1111 The NCCN Panel recommends \nsingle -agent olaparib as recurrence therapy for patients with advanced \novarian cancer (platinum sensitive or resistant) who have received 3 or \nmore lines of chemotherapy and who have a germline BRCA  mutation \n(detected using an FDA -approved test or other validated test performed in \na CLIA -approved facility) based on this trial and the FDA approval.1112  \nA recent phase 3 randomized trial (SOLO2/ENGOT -Ov21) assessed \nolaparib (tablets) as maintenance therapy for those  (n=295) with \nplatinum -sensitive high -grade serous ovarian cancer and BRCA mutations who had received 2 or more lines of chemotherapy; the trial also included \npatients with high -grade endometrioid cancer, primary peritoneal, or \nfallopian tube cancer.944 Data show that the median PFS was significantly \nlonger in those  receiving olaparib (19.1 months [95% CI, 16.3 –25.7]) than \nin those receiving placebo (5.5 months [5.2 –5.8]; HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.22 –\n0.41], P<.0001). More patients receiving olaparib maintenance therapy \nhad serious AEs (18% [35/195]) compared with placebo (8% [8/99]). The \nmost common serious (grade 3 or worse) AEs included anemia (19% \n[38/195] in the olaparib group vs. 2% [2/99] in the placebo group), fatigue \nor asthenia (4% [8/195] vs. 2% [2/99 ]), and neutropenia (5% [10/195] vs. \n4% [4/99]). In the olaparib group, one (1%) patient died from a \ntreatment -related AE (acute myeloid leukemia). The FDA recently \napproved olaparib (tablets) as maintenance therapy for those  with \nrecurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer \nwho have had complete or PRs to platinum -based chemotherapy.  \nFor the 2017 update (Version 3), the NCCN Panel recommends that \nolaparib (tablets) be considered as maintenance therapy for those with \novarian cancer who have received 2 or more lines of chemotherapy based \non this trial (SOLO2/ENGOT -Ov21) and the FDA approval.944 Note that \nolaparib is transitioning from capsules (original FDA approval) to tablets \nfor the maintenance and recurrence therapy indications. Olaparib tablets \n(100 mg and 150 mg) should not be substituted with olaparib capsules (50 \nmg) because of differenc es in the dosing and bioavailability of each \nformulation.  \nRucaparib  \nRucaparib is also an oral PARP inhibitor.1113 A recent phase 2 trial \n(ARIEL2) assessed rucaparib as recurrence therapy for patients with \nplatinum -sensitive ovarian cancer.1114 PFS was increased in patients (n  = \n40) with BRCA  mutations (12.8 months [95% CI, 9.0 –14.7]) when \ncompared with wild type (n = 70) (5.2 months [95% CI, 3.6 –5.5]) (HR, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

For those  taking rucaparib, serious \nAEs were small intestinal obstruction (10 [5%] of 204 patients), malignant \nneoplasm progression (10 [5%]), and anemia (9 [4%]). During the trial, 3 \npatients died (2 with disease progression; one with sepsis and disease \nprogression); deaths were not reported a s related to treatment. Based on \nthis trial and the FDA approval, the NCCN Panel recommends \nsingle -agent rucaparib as recurrence therapy for patients with \nplatinum -sensitive or plati num-resistant ovarian cancer who have been \ntreated with 2 or more lines of chemotherapy and have BRCA mutations \n(detected as previously described).1114,1115 The NCCN Panel feels that \nrucaparib is preferred for patients with platinum -resistant disease, because \nthere are fewer good options for this setting. In a pooled analysis, the \noverall response rate with rucaparib was reported as 66% (52/79; 95% CI, \n54–76) for platinum -sensitive disease and 25% (5/20; 95% CI [9 –49]) for \nplatinum -resistant disease.1113 A recent phase 1 to 2 study reported a \nresponse rate of 59.5% in patients with platinum -sensitive disease and \nBRCA mutations who had received 2 to 4 courses of therapy.1113  \nNiraparib  \nNiraparib is another oral PARP 1/2 inhibitor.1116 A phase 3 trial (NOVA) \nassessed niraparib as maintenance therapy for patients whose  \nplatinum -sensitive ovarian cancer responded to recurrence therapy.1116 \nFor the 2017 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel added a \nrecommendation to repeat the prior imaging to assess response. Data \nshowed that niraparib increased PFS regardless of whether patients had a \nBRCA mutation when compared with placebo. Patients receivi ng niraparib \nwithout a germline BRCA  mutation had increased PFS (12.9 months vs. \n3.8 months). Individuals  with a germline BRCA mutation had a much \ngreater increase in PFS (21.0 vs. 5.5 months) (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.17 –\n0.41). For those taking niraparib, grad e 3 or 4 AEs that were commonly \nreported included thrombocytopenia (33.8%), anemia (25.3%), and \nneutropenia (19.6%). For the 2017 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel recommends niraparib as maintenance therapy for patients with \nplatinum -sensitive disease who have had 2 or more lines of \nplatinum -based therapy and a CR or PR  to the most recent line of \nrecurrence therapy based on this trial and the FDA approval.1116,1117  \nLess Common Ovarian Cancers  \nThe LCO C include carcinosarcomas  (MMMTs), clear cell carcinoma, \nmucinous carcinoma, low -grade (grade 1) serous/endometrioid epithelial \ncarcinoma, borderline epithelial tumors, malignant sex cord -stromal \ntumors, and malignant germ cell tumors.139 The complete histologic \nclassification for ovarian cancer from the WHO describes the different \ntypes of LCOC  (see WHO Histologic Classification  in the algorithm ).1 The \nAJCC/FIGO staging system for ovarian cancer is also used to stage the \nLCOC  (see Staging: Table 1  and other staging tables in the algorithm ). \nPanel members believe there is value in identifying pathways that may \nserve as therapeutic targets for the LCOC  because of the promise of new \nand novel approaches to treatment.139 However, there are limited data for \nthese rare histologies because of their infrequency and it will be difficult to \nacquire prospective data. Clinical trials for eligible patients and \nindividualized treatment plans, for those who are ineligible for trials , may \nbe the most suitable approaches to treatment in these patients at this time. \nThe different IV and IV/IP chemotherapy regimens used for high -grade \nserous ovarian cancer may also be recommended for patients with LCOC ; \nhowever, the recommendations are o nly category 2A for LCOC  because \nof the limited data.  \nRecommended Workup  \nPatients may obtain consultation at an NCCN Member Institution for \nrecommendations and treatment of an undiagnosed pelvic mass, or for \nmanagement of a previously biopsied malignant ovarian tumor.

The diagnosis of LCO C is \noften not made until after surgery for a suspicious pelvic mass (see \nEpithelial Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal \nCancer: Primary Treatment  in the algorithm ). Therefore, the workup for \nLCOC  is the same as for other types of ovarian cancer except that tumor \nmarkers are measured a nd other testing is done to determine the specific \nhistopathology (see Epithelial Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube \nCancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer: Workup  in the algorithm ). Tumor \nmarkers may include CA -125, inhibin, beta -hCG, alfa -fetoprotein, and \ncarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Individuals  younger than 35 years with a \npelvic mass should have AFP levels measured to assess for germ cell \ntumors and to rule out pregnancy.433-435 A GI tract evaluation is \nrecommended for mucinous histology to determine whether an occult GI \nprimary has metastasized to the ovaries.527 An intraoperative frozen \nsection evaluation is recommended for those  who would like to maintain \ntheir fertility (see next section).  \nSurgery  \nIn contrast to high -grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer or MMMTs, \nmany patients with other LCOC  present at an early stage. Some of the \ntumors may be confined to one ovary. Thus, some of these patients are \ncandidates for fertility -sparing surgery, which may be done \nlaparoscopically (see Principles of Surgery  in the algorithm ).675,676,679,1118 -\n1122 Fertility -sparing surgery may be performed (if technically feasible) if \nthe intraoperative frozen section results are positive for apparent \nearly -stage tumors and/or low -risk tumors (ie, malignant germ cell tumors, \nborderline epithelial tumors, clinical s tage I epithelial ovarian tumors, \nclinical stage I mucinous tumors, or clinical stage I sex cord -stromal \ntumors).675,676,679,1119 -1122 Patients who do not desire fertility preservation; \nthose who have a clinical stage II, III, or IV epithelial ovarian cancer; those with a clinical stage II, III, or IV sex cord -stromal tumor; or those with \nMMMT should undergo comprehensive surgical staging as per the ovarian \ncancer guidelines (see Principles of Surgery  in the algorithm ).  \nPatients may have been referred to an NCCN Member Institution after \nreceiving a diagnosis of an LCOC  tumor. The recommended initial surgical \nrecommendation depends on the specific histologic diagnosis. Often, \npatients have been comprehensively staged (having met the standards for \nsurgical staging of the GOG) and have undergone cytoreductive surgery. \nIn some instances, they are referred after having had incomplete  staging \n(ie, uterus and/or adnexa intact, omentum not removed, surgical stage not \ndocumented).  \nClear Cell Carcinoma  \nClear cell carcinomas are considered high -grade tumors; they are more \ncommon than the other LCOC .562 Most clear cell carcinomas are negative \nfor WT1 and estrogen receptors.562 The NCCN Guidelines provide an \nalgorithm for clear cell carcinomas (see Less Common Ovarian Cancer s: \nClear Cell Carcinoma  of the Ovary and WHO Histologic Classification  in \nthe algorithm ).1 Because patients are typically diagnosed with clear cell \ncarcinoma after pathologic analysis of a surgical specimen, the workup for \nsuspicious or palpable pelvic masses is done before surgery as described \nin the algorithm (see Epithelial Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube \nCancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer: Workup  in the algorithm ).  \nPrimary treatment for these patients includes completion surgery with \ncomprehensive staging followed by postoperative therapy (see Less \nCommon Ovarian Cancer s: Clear Cell Carcinoma  of the Ovary  in the \nalgorithm ).1123 Fertility -sparing surgery is not recommended for stage IA to \nC clear cell carcinomas. Lymphadenectomy has been shown to improve \nsurvival.1124 The staging system for high -grade serous ovarian and primary \nperitoneal cancer is also used for clear cell carcinomas (see Staging: PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Patients \nwith advanced clear cell carcinoma have a poor p rognosis.1123,1124 Data \nsuggest that 6 or 3 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy are equivalent \nfor patients with clear cell carcinoma.802,1128  \nMucinous Carcinomas  \nMucinous tumors are unusual because they may be very large cystic \nmasses that may fill the abdomen and pelvis; this presentation often \nsuggests mucinous histology. Patients with mucinous carcinoma of the \novary are often diagnosed with early -stage disease a nd have a good \nprognosis; the 5 -year DFS is about 80% to 90%.527,1129 Individuals  with \nmucinous tumors typically present at a younger age (20 –40 years) than \nthose with high -grade serous ovarian cancer. The NCCN Guidelines \nprovide an algorithm for mucinous carcinoma (see Less Common Ovarian \nCancers:  Mucinous Carcinoma of the Ovary  and the WHO Histologic \nClassification  in the algorithm ).1 For the 2017 update (Version 1), the \nNCCN Panel added a recommendation for fertility -sparing surgery, if not \npreviously done, for select patients with stage IA to C disease.  \nPatients are typically diagnosed with mucinous carcinoma after surgery for \na suspicious pelvic mass (see Epithelial Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer:  Primary Treatment  in the algorithm ). \nTherefore, the initial workup is the same as for other types of ovarian \ncancer (see Epithelial Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary \nPeritoneal Cancer:  Workup  in the algorithm ). Primary treatment for these \npatients includes completion surgery with comprehensive staging followed \nby postop erative therapy or observation (see Less Common Ovarian \nCancers: Mucinous Carcinoma  of the Ovary  in the algorithm ).527 An \nappendectomy is also recommended at primary surgery in patients with \nsuspected or confirmed mucinous ovarian tumors. Fertility -sparing surgery \nis an option for select patients with stage I mucinous tumors (see Less \nCommon Ovarian Cancers : Ovarian Borderline Epithelial Tumors [Low \nMalignant Potential]  in the algorithm ).The staging system for high -grade \nserous epithelial ovarian cancer and primary peritoneal cancer is also \nused for mucinous carcinomas (see Staging: Table 1  in the algorithm ).547  \nThe additional workup includes a GI tract evaluation and CEA level for \npatients with mucinous histology to determine whether patients have either \noccult GI primary that has metastasized to the ovaries or primary \nmucinous carcinoma of the ovaries (see Epithelial Ovarian \nCancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer:  Workup  in the \nalgorithm ).527 Metastases to the ovaries are more common, and primary \nmucinous tumors of the ovaries are uncommon; it is difficult to distinguish \nbetween metastatic adenocarcinomas to the ovaries and primary \nmucinous carcinomas.574-576 PAX8 immunostaining may be useful.574 \nPostoperative observation and monitoring are recommended for patients \nwith stage IA or IB mucinous tumors because most of these tumors are \nbenign or borderline.527,562 For patients with stage IC mucinous \ncarcinomas, postoperative options include: 1) observation; 2) IV \ncarboplatin with either paclitaxel or docetaxel; 3) \n5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin GI regimen); or 4) capecitabine/oxaliplatin ( GI \nregimen).527 Some clinicians feel the GI regimens are appropriate because PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-92 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nLow-Grade Serous  Carcinoma  \nLow-grade serous carcinoma is a subtype of serous carcinoma that is \nconsidered pathologically distinct from the more commonly diagnosed \nhigh-grade serous carcinoma, and represent s less than  5% of epithelial \novarian cancers.139,1131 Low-grade serous carcinoma is characterized by \nmild to moderate nuclear atypia, and up to 12 mitoses per 10 high -\npowered fields (HPF), while high -grade serous  carcinoma  is \ncharacterized by marked nuclear atypia and over 12 mitoses per 10 \nHPF.560,1131,1132 Additionally, activating mutations in the mitogen -activated \nprotein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway are frequently identified in low -grade, but \nnot high -grade, serous carcinomas; in contrast, TP53 mutations are \ngenerally associated with high -grade, but not low -grade, serous \ncarcinomas.1133 -1138 Low-grade serous carcinomas are associated with \nmore indolent disease and present at a younger age than high -grade \nserous carcinomas; however, they are also often advanced at \ndiagnosis.560,579,1132,1139 Approximately 60% of low -grade serous \ncarcinomas (v s. 2% of high -grade serous carcinomas) are also \nassociated with serous borderline tumors (low malignant potential).560 \nDue to these distinctions, patients with low -grade serous carcinomas are \ngenerally treated differently than those with high -grade serous \ncarcinomas, as described below.  \nPrimary Treatment  \nPrimary treatment for low -grade serous carcinomas is comprised of \ncompletion surgery with comprehensive staging, followed by adjuvant \ntherapy or observation .579 Typically the diagnosis of low -grade serous \ncarcinoma is made via comprehensive pathology review after initial \nsurgery. The staging system for high -grade serous ovarian , fallopian \ntube,  and primary peritoneal cancer is also used for low -grade serous.547 \nLow-grade serous carcinomas often respond poorly to chemotherapy \ncompared with high -grade serous carcinomas1140; therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is less favored for patients with low -grade serous \ncarcinoma.579  \nRecommendations for adjuvant treatment are stratified by stage in the \nguidelines (see LCOC -6). Postoperative observation is a category 2A \nrecommendation for patients with stage IA and IB disease and a category \n2B recommendation for those with stage IC disease.  Several adjuvant \nsystemic therapy options, including paclitaxel /platinum -containing \nregimens, are recommended for  patients with stage IC or stage II –IV \ndisease , although there are limited data on systemic therapy regimens in \npatients with low -grade se rous carcinoma in general.  \nPatients with low -grade serous carcinomas  may also benefit from \nmaintenance hormone therapy following adjuvant chemotherapy. One \ndatabase study  observed that  patients with stage II –IV low -grade serous \ncarcinoma who received maintenance hormone therapy after completing \nprimary cytoreductive surgery and first-line platinum -based chemotherapy  \nexperienced longer progression -free survival (PFS) than those who did not  \nreceive maintenance hormone therapy (median PFS, 64.9 vs. 26.4 \nmonths; P < .001).1141 The majority of patients in the study received \nletrozole  (54.3%) , with a lower proportion receiving  tamoxifen (28.6%).  \nBased on these data, maintenance hormone therapy (letrozole, \nanastrozole, exemestane, leuprolide acetate, or tamoxifen) is a category \n2B recommendation in the guidelines.  \nAdjuvant hormone therapy as a substitute for adjuvant chemotherapy is \nanother potential option for these patients.1142 However, as there are no \nsupporting prospective data, this is a category 2B recommended option in \nthe guidelines.  A randomized trial of paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy \nfollowed by maintenance hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy \nalone in patients with low -grade serous carcinoma is currently \nunderway.1143  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

MS-93 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nMonitoring/Follow -up for Recurrent Disease  \nUnfortunately, patients with low -grade serous carcinoma , particularly \nthose with advanced stage disease,  may experience disease relapse; \ntherefore, continued monitoring of these patients is essential.  The \nguidelines recommend monitoring for potential recurrence of low -grade \nserous carcinoma through follow -up visits every 2  to 4 months for 2 \nyears, followed by 3  to 6 months for 3 years, and then annually after 5 \nyears (see LCOC -7). These visits should consist of a physical \nexam ination , including a pelvic exam ination . Tumor molecular testing is \nrecommend ed, if not previously done; more comprehensive somatic \ngenetic testing may be particularly important in low-grade serous \ncarcinoma, which has  limited approved therapeutic options. Imaging and \ncomplete blood count ( CBC )/chemistry profile are also recommended, as \nclinically indicated. CA -125 or other tumor markers should be assessed if \ninitially elevated. Refer patients for a  genetic risk evaluation , if not \npreviously done. For guidance on long -term wellness care for patients \nwho have been treated for low -grade serous carcinoma, please refer to \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship ( www.NCCN.org ).  \nRecurrence Therapy  \nThe NCCN Guidelines recommend several options for patients with \nrecurrent low -serous carcinoma (see LCOC -7). Secondary cytoreduction \ncan be considered for patients with a long disease -free interval, isolated \nmasses rather than diffuse carcinomatosis on imaging, and/ or bowel \nobstruction. Systemic therapy is another option for this patient \npopulation; however, the guidelines emphasize that there is no standard \nsequencing of drugs for recurrent disease. Therefore, each patient \nshould be evaluated on an individ ual basis, taking into consideration \nprior therapies , disease burden, molecular profile, and the relative \nefficacy and toxicity profile before initiating systemic therapy. \nRecommended systemic therapies for this patient population in this setting include chemotherapy (if not previously used) and hormonal \ntherapy.579,1144 \nHowever, it has been reported that low -grade serous carcinoma may be \nmore chemo -resistant than high -grade serous carcinoma in the recurrent \nsetting .1145 Thus, effective systemic options for recurrent low -grade \nserous carcinoma have remained an unmet need. Importantly,  recent \nstudies have suggested that MEK inhibitors have activity in  recurrent \nlow-grade serous carcinoma. A phase 2/3 open -label, randomized study \nevaluated the efficacy and safety of trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, \ncompared with five standard -of-care options ( SOC; paclitaxel, pegylated \nliposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, letrozole, or tamoxifen) in 260 patients \nwith recurrent low -grade serous c arcinoma.1146 The median progression -\nfree survival was 13.0 months in the trametinib arm, compared with 7.2 \nmonths in the standard -of-care group (HR , 0.48; 95% CI, 0.36 –0.64; P < \n.0001). The overall response rate (ORR) of the trametinib group was \n26%, which was significantly higher than the 6% ORR of the SOC group \n(P < .0001). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported in \nthe trametinib group were skin rash, anemia, hypertension, diarrhea, \nnausea, and fatigue. Due to the superior outcomes reported in this tria l, \nthe NCCN panel  recommend s trametinib as a category 2A option for \npatients with recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma.  \nThe efficacy and safety of another MEK1/2 inhibitor, binimetinib, was \nevaluated in a phase 3 open -label study in 303 patients with recurrent \nlow-grade serous carcinoma.1147 Patients were randomized to receive \neither binimetinib or physician’s choice chemotherapy (PCC; pegylated \nliposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or top otecan). The median PFS for the \nbinimetinib group was 9.1 versus 10.6 months in the PCC group (HR , \n1.21; 95% CI, 0.79–1.86; P = .807); therefore, the primary endpoint of \nPFS by blinded independent central review ( BICR ) was not met in this \nstudy.

Additionally, PFS and ORR data from a post hoc \nanalysis suggested that a response to binimetinib may be associated \nwith the presence of a KRAS  mutation. Based on these data, the NCCN \npanel recommends binimetinib as a category 2B option for patients with \nrecurrent low -grade serous ca rcinoma.  \nRecently a new option became available for patients with recurrent low -\ngrade serous carcinoma with a BRAF V600E  mutation. In June 2022, the \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to \nselective BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in combination with trametinib for the \ntreatment of adult and pediatric patients ( 6 years and older ) with \nunresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF V600E  mutation who \nhave progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory \nalternative treatment option s.1148 -1150 This approval was based on several \nstudies; one of these was the phase 2 open -label single -arm NCI -\nMATCH trial (subprotocol H), where dabrafenib in combination with \ntrametinib was evaluated in patients with solid tumors, lymphoma, or \nmultiple myeloma who progressed on at least one standard therapy.1151 \nOut of the 29 patients included in the primary analysis, five had low -\ngrade serous carcinoma and one had mucinous -papillary serous \nadenocarcinoma of peritoneum. The ORR of the overall population was \n38%, with a PFS of 11.4 months. Notably, a clinical benefit was observed \nin all 6 patients with primary gynecologic cancer; 5 patients achieved a \npartial response (PR) (>12 months for 3 patients) and 1 patient had \nstable disease (SD) for 8 months following treatment.  Based on the \nresults, the combination of dab rafenib and trametinib has been added to \nthe guidelines as a category 2A recurrence therapy option for patients \nwith BRAF V600E -positive tumors (including low -grade serous \ncarcinoma).  In addition to the options described above, other  acceptable systemic \nrecurrence therapies listed in the Principles of Systemic Therapy  section \nof the guidelines  (OV-C 8 of 11 and OV -C 9 of 11, available on \nhttp://www.NCCN.org ) can be considered. Clinical trial enrollment and \nobservation are other recommended options for patients with recurrent \nlow-grade serous carcinoma.  \nIn response to the availability of novel treatment options for recurrent \nlow-grade serous carcinoma, the NCCN panel has developed a new \nalgorithm page with recommendations for the management of recurrent \nlow-grade serous carcinoma; please refer to LCOC -7 for additional \ndetails.  \nEndometrial Epithelial Carcinoma  \nSection development  in progress  \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Gonadal dysgenesis is a \nrisk factor for germ cell tumors.470 Malignant germ cell tumors have an \nexcellent prognosis.1154 After appropriate treatment, 5 -year survival is \nmore than 85%.1152,1155,1156  \nTreatment  \nFertility -sparing surgery is recommended for those desiring fertility \npreservation, regardless of stage (see Less Common Ovarian Cancers: \nMalignant Germ Cell Tumors  in the algorithm ).428,679,1156 -1159 Surgery for \nchildren or adolescents may differ from that for adults  (see Principles of \nSurgery  in the algorithm ). In children or adolescents with early -stage germ \ncell tumors, comprehensive staging may be omitted.685,1160 Completion \nsurgery with comprehensive staging is recommended as initial surgery for \npatients who do not desire fertility preservation (see Less Common \nOvarian Cancers: Malignant Germ Cell Tumors  in the algorithm ).470 The \nstaging system for high -grade serous ovarian and primary peritoneal \ncancer is also used for malignant germ cell tumors (see Staging: Table 1  \nin the algorithm ).547 After comprehensive surgical staging, observation with \nmonitoring is recommended for patients with stage I dysgerminoma or \nstage I, grade 1 immature teratoma.1161 If patients have had incomplete surgical staging, recommended options depend on the type of tumor, the \nresults of imaging and tumor marker testing (eg, AFP, beta -HCG), the age \nof the patient, and whether the patient desires fertility preservation (see \nLess Common Ovarian Cancers: Malignant Germ Cell Tumors  in the \nalgorithm ). Patients who chose fertility -sparing surgery should be \nmonitored by US examinations if necessary; completion surgery (category \n2B) should be considered after finishing childbearing.  \nAfter surgery, observation with surveillance is the recommended option for \npatients with stage I dysgerminoma or stage I, grade I immature teratoma \nbased on European and pediatric reports.448,450,451,1162 Observation or \nchemotherapy may be considered for children or adolescents with select \nstage IA or IB tumors (see Less Common Ovarian Cancers: Malignant \nGerm Cell Tumors  in the algorithm ).428,448,1162 -1165 For patients with stage II \nto IV malignant dysgerminomas  or immature teratomas, postoperative \nchemotherapy is recommended (see Principles of Systemic Therapy: \nSystemic Therapy Regimens - Malignant Germ Cell /Sex Cord -Stromal  \nTumors  in the algorithm ).  \nPostoperative chemotherapy for 3 to 4 cycles with \nbleomycin/etoposide/cisplatin (BEP) (category 2B for 3 vs. 4 cycles) is \nrecommended for: 1) any stage embryonal tumors or endodermal sinus \ntumors; 2) stages II to V dysgerminoma; or 3) stage I, grade 2 to 3 , or \nstage II to IV immature teratoma (see the Principles of Systemic Therapy : \nSystemic therapy Regimens - Malignant Germ Cell /Sex Cord -Stromal  \nTumors  in the algorithm ).1153,1166 -1168 If considering the use of bleomycin, \npulmonary function tests are recommended.1153,1155 The 4 -cycle BEP \nregimen is recommended (category 2A) as the standard regimen. \nAlthough most clinicians avoid a 3 -week BEP regimen, some feel that a \n3-week BEP regimen (3 cycles) may be useful in patients with low -risk or \nstage 1 disease, although this is a category 2B recommendation; the \nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center criteria can be used to identify PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

For those with abnormal markers and definitive recurrent disease, \noption s (category 2B) include: 1) high -dose chemotherapy;1177 or 2) \nconsider additional chemotherapy (see Principles of Systemic Therapy:  \nSystemic Therapy Regimens – Malignant Germ Cell/Sex Cord -Stromal \nTumors  in the algorithm ). Referral of these patients to a tertiary care \ncenter for stem -cell transplant consultation and potentially curative therapy \nis strongly recommended. Several case reports suggest that patients who \nhave received chemotherapy for germ cell tumors may later  present with \ngrowing teratoma syndrome.1178 -1181  \nResidual or Recurrent Disease  \nFor patients having radiographic evidence of residual tumor (after surgery \nand chemotherapy) but with normal AFP and beta -HCG, consider surgical \nresection of the tumor; observation with monitoring is also an option. \nClinical judgment should be used regardi ng the frequency of imaging.1182 \nFurther options depend on which findings are present: residual \nmalignancy, benign teratoma, or necrotic tissue (see Therapy for  \nRecurrent/Persistent Disease  for Malignant Germ Cell Tumors  in the \nalgorithm ). For patients with definitive residual disease and with \npersistently elevated AFP and/or beta -HCG after first -line chemotherapy, recommendations include TIP (paclitaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin)1183 or \nhigh-dose chemotherapy. Referral to a tertiary care center for potentially \ncurative treatment is strongly recommended.1184 There are small series but \nno major trials in adult patients.   \nPatients with recurrent or residual malignancy after multiple \nchemotherapeutic regimens may be treated with a recurrence modality \n(see Principles of Systemic Therapy:  Acceptable Systemic Therapy \nRegimens - Malignant Germ Cell/Sex Cord -Stromal Tumors  in the \nalgorithm ), including potentially curative high -dose chemotherapy or TIP. \nOther regimens include VAC (vincristine, dactinomycin, \ncyclophosphamide), VeIP (vinblastine, ifosfamide, cisplatin), VIP \n(etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin), cisplatin/etoposide, \ndocetaxel/carboplatin, paclitaxel/carboplatin, paclitaxel/gemcitabine, \npaclitaxel/ifosfamide, docetaxel, paclitaxel, RT, or supportive care \nonly.1171,1184 -1188 These recurrence regimens (see Principles of Systemic \nTherapy:  Systemic Therapy Regimens - Malignant Germ Cell/Sex \nCord -Stromal Tumors  in the algorithm ) are not generalizable for all of the \nuncommon histology tumors; therefore, patients should be referred to \ntertiary care institutions for treatment.  \nMalignant Sex Cord -Stromal Tumors  \nMalignant sex cord -stromal tumors are rare and include granulosa cell \ntumors (most common) and Sertoli -Leydig cell tumors; they are typically \nassociated with a good prognosis.660,1189 Most patients with granulosa \ntumors present with early -stage disease; the disease is typically \nindolent.659 The complete histologic classification for ovarian cancer from \nthe WHO includes the different types of sex cord -stromal tumors; it is \nimportant to determine whether the sex cord -stromal tumor is benign or \nmalignant (see  WHO Histologic Classification: Sex Cord -Stromal Tumors  \nin the algorithm ).1 The staging system for high -grade serous ovarian and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:54:39 PM.

Postoperative options in the NCCN Guidelines have category \n2B recommendations (see Less Common Ovarian Cancers: Malignant \nSex Cord -Stromal Tumors  in the algorithm ).1190 For patients with high -risk \nstage I tumors (tumor rupture, stage 1C, poorly differentiated tumor, and \ntumor size >10 –15 cm467), postoperative recommendations (all are \ncategory 2B) include observation or consideration of platinum -based \nchemotherapy.1193 Observation is recommended for those with surgical \nfindings of low -risk stage I tumor (ie, without high -risk features) (see \nSurveillance for Malignant Germ Cell and Sex Cord -Stromal Tumors  in the \nalgorithm ). For patients with granulosa cell tumors who are being \nobserved, inhibin levels can be followed if they were initially elevated \n(category 2B). For patients with stage II to IV tumors, recommended \noptions (all are category 2B) include RT for limited disea se or \nplatinum -based chemotherapy (BEP or paclitax el/carboplatin regimens are \npreferred).1194 -1197  \nSurveillance recommendations for malignant sex cord -stromal tumors are \nprovided in the algorithm, which are based on the SGO recommendations \n(see Surveillance for Malignant Germ Cell and Sex Cord -Stromal Tumors  \nin the algorithm ).1017 Prolonged surveillance is recommended for \ngranulosa cell tumors, because they can recur years later (eg, 30 \nyears).660,1158,1189,1198 For patients with stage II to IV tumors who subsequently have a clinical relapse, options include a clinical trial or \nrecurrence therapy (see Principles of Systemic Therapy:  Systemic \nTherapy Regimens - Malignant Germ Cell/Sex Cord -Stromal Tumors in \nthe algorithm ).1189,1198 -1201 Cytotoxic recurrence therapy includes: \ndocetaxel, paclitaxel, paclitaxel/ifosfamide, paclitaxel/carboplatin, and \nVAC. Hormone recurrence therapy includes: aromatase inhibitors, \nleuprolide, and tamoxifen. Note that single -agent bevacizumab or \nleuprolide is  an option for patients with recurrent granulosa cell \ntumors.1201,1202 Secondary cytoreductive surgery may also be considered. \nPalliative localized RT may also be useful.  \nCarcinosarcomas (Malignant Mixed Müllerian Tumors)  \nMMMTs are rare tumors with a poor prognosis; they are the most \naggressive tumors in the algorithm.1203 -1206 Most pathologists now consider \nMMMTs to be a variant of poorly differentiated epithelial ovarian cancer \n(metaplastic carcinoma).566 Patients with MMMTs are not candidates for \nfertility -sparing surgery regardless of age or stage. The staging system for \novarian and primary peritoneal cancer is also used for MMMTs (see \nStaging: Table 1  in the algorithm ).547,1205  \nOptimal surgical debulking is recommended for patients with MMMTs (see \nPrinciples of  Surgery  in the algorithm ).1205,1207 -1209 After complete surgical \nstaging, several postoperative chemotherapy regimens are recommended \nfor patients with stage I to IV MMMT. Patients with stage I to IV MMMT or \nrecurrence may be treated using the same primary chemotherapy \nregimens that are recommen ded for epithelial ovarian cancer; for the 2017 \nupdate (Version 1), the panel decided these chemotherapy regimens are \npreferred options (see Principles of Systemic Therapy:  Primary Systemic  \nTherapy  Regimens  in the algorithm ).566,1210 -1215 For example, IV carboplatin \nwith either paclitaxel, docetaxel, or liposomal doxorubicin are \nrecommended for patients with stage I -IV MMMT.

Other recommended postoperative chemotherapy options include \ncisplatin/ifosfamide (category 2A), carboplatin/ifosfamide (category 2A), \nand ifosfamide/paclitaxel (category 2B).566,1203,1210,1216 After treatment, the \nsurveillance and follow -up recommendations for epithelial ovarian cancer \nare also used for MMMTs.  \nBorderline Epithelial Tumors (Low Malignant Potential)  \nDiagnosis  \nBorderline epithelial tumors are rare tumors and are managed differently \nthan high -grade carcinomas (see Less Common Ovarian Cancers:  \nOvarian Borderline Epithelial Tumors [Low Malignant Potential]  in the \nalgorithm ).1118,1217 Five-year survival exceeds 80%.1218 In contrast to \npatients with frankly invasive ovarian carcinoma, those  with borderline \nepithelial tumors tend to be younger, are often diagnosed with stage I \ndisease, and are candidates for fertility -sparing surgery.1219,1220 A \nborderline tumor is a primary epithelial lesion with cytologic characteristics \nsuggesting malignancy but without frank invasion and with a clinically \nindolent course and good prognosis.1221,1222 \nThe terms for borderline epithelial tumors (also known as LMP tumors or \natypical proliferative tumors) have changed over the years.562 The 2016 \nand 2017 CAP cancer protocols for ovarian cancer use borderline and do \nnot use LMP.1223,1224 Borderline epithelial tumors are typically serous or \nmucinous; other histologic subtypes can also occur (see WHO Histologic \nClassification  in the algorithm ).1,1118  \nThe characteristic pathologic hallmark of typical epithelial ovarian cancer \nis the identification of peritoneal implants, which microscopically and/or \nmacroscopically invade the peritoneum. A borderline epithelial tumor may \ngrossly resemble an invasive can cer. However, microscopic evaluation \nfails to reveal evidence of frank invasion by the tumor nodules, although \nrarely invasive implants (which continue to be consistent with the diagnosis of borderline epithelial lesions) can be identified microscopically \nby the pathologist.  \nTreatment  \nSurgery is the primary treatment for borderline epithelial tumors, including \nstandard ovarian cancer debulking surgery or fertility -sparing surgery \ndepending on the surgical evaluation and other factors (see Less Common \nOvarian Cancers: Ovarian Borderline Epithelial Tumors [Low Malignant \nPotential]  in the algorithm ).1225 Treatment guidelines for borderline \nepithelial tumors depend on the histologic and clinical characteristics, the \nage of the patient,1220 and whether invasive implants are present. Patients \nshould be evaluated by a gynecologic oncologist. At NCCN Member \nInstitutions, patients may be initially evaluated with an undiagnosed pelvic \nmass or with an established diagnosis of borderline epithelial  tumor. \nNCCN Panel Members are less likely to recommend aggressive treatment \nafter surgery; observation is one of several possible approaches.1118,1226 \nAlthough the staging system for epithelial ovarian cancer is used for \nborderline epithelial tumors, the NCCN Guidelines use the presence or \nabsence of invasive implants to determine the need for postoperative \ntherapy (see Less Common Ovarian Cancers: Ovarian Borderline \nEpithelial Tumors [Low Malignant Potential]  in the algorithm ).  \nPatients with a borderline epithelial tumor who desire to maintain their \nfertility may undergo surgery limited to a USO (preserving the uterus, \ncontralateral ovary, and contralateral Fallopian tube) with resection of \nresidual disease.675,676,1227 BSO and preserving the uterus is an option for \nselect patients. If the patient does not desire fertility -sparing surgery, \nstandard ovarian cancer surgery (TAH, BSO, and debulking as needed) \nand resection of residual disease are recommended. Data do not sh ow \nincreased survival with lymphadenectomy and omentectomy for borderline \nepithelial tumor, although upstaging does occur.728,1228 Lymph node \nevaluation may be considered on a case -by-case basis.

MS-99 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nFor patients with known borderline epithelial tumors  who had incomplete \nprevious surgery and/or were incompletely staged at the time of their initial \nlaparotomy, recommendations depend on whether invasive implants are \npresent and whether fertility preservation is desired (see the prior \nincomplete surgical resection pathway in Less Common Ovarian Cancers: \nOvarian Borderline Epithelial Tumors [Low Malignant Potential]  in the \nalgorithm ). Patients who want to preserve their fertility should have \nfertility -sparing surgery and resection of residual disease. Some clinicians \nfeel that the appearance of invasive implants on the peritoneal surfaces in \npatients with borderline epithelial tumors portends a less favorab le \nprognosis; therefore, postoperative chemotherapy with the same regimens \nused for low -grade (grade 1) serous epithelial ovarian cancer can be \nconsidered for these patients (see Less Common Ovarian Cancers: \nOvarian Borderline Epithelial Tumors [Low Malign ant Potential]  in the \nalgorithm ).1219,1220,1229 Postoperative IV carboplatin with either docetaxel or \npaclitaxel is recommended. The benefit of chemotherapy, either IP or IV, \nis controversial in patients with borderline epithelial tumors. The \nsignificance of invasive implants remains under investigation.1118,1230 The \nbenefit of postoperative chemotherapy has not been demonstrated for \npatients who have no microscopically demonstrable invasive implants.1231 \nAlthough observation is an option for all patients, it is a category 3 \nrecommendation for patients with invasive implants and a category 2B \nrecommendation for patients without invasive implants (see Less Common \nOvarian Cancers: Ovarian Borderline Epithelial Tumors [Low Malignant \nPotential]  in the algorithm ).  \nFollow -up \nTreatment recommendations after surgery depend on the presence or \nabsence of invasive implants. The initial therapeutic approach for patients \nhaving invasive implants may include treatment with the same \nchemotherapeutic regimens used for low -grade (grade 1 ) serous epithelial \novarian cancer or observation (category 3) (see Less Common Ovarian Cancers: Ovarian Borderline Epithelial Tumors [Low Malignant Potential]  \nin the algorithm ).1230 Patients with no invasive implants may be observed \n(category 2B) and monitored (see Monitoring/Follow -Up in Less Common \nOvarian Cancers: Ovarian Borderline Epithelial Tumors [Low Malignant \nPotential]  in the algorithm ).1219,1232 Patients who chose fertility -sparing \nsurgery should be monitored by US examinations if necessary. After \nchildbearing is completed, completion surgery should be considered \n(category 2B).1118  \nRelapse  \nAt the time of clinical relapse, surgical evaluation and debulking are \nrecommended if appropriate. Patients who have low -grade invasive \ncarcinoma or invasive implants from borderline epithelial tumors may be \ntreated using the same recommendations as for lo w-grade (grade 1) \nserous epithelial ovarian cancer; those with high -grade invasive implants \nmay be treated using the same recommendations as for epithelial ovarian \ncancer (see Recurrence Therapy  in Less Common Ovarian Cancers: \nOvarian Borderline Epithelial  Tumors [Low Malignant Potential]  in the \nalgorithm ). Observation is recommended for those with noninvasive \ndisease.  \nSummary  \nEpithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic \ncancer in the United States and is the country’s fifth most common cause \nof cancer mortality in females . More than 70% of patients present with \nadvanced disease. The literature does not support routine screening for \novarian cancer in the general population, and routine screening is not \ncurrently recommended by any professional society.

MS-100 NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nOvarian Cancer  \nmalignant sex cord -stromal tumors, and malignant germ cell tumors. \nPrimary peritoneal and Fallopian tube cancers are treated in the same \nmanner as epithelial ovarian cancer.  \nThe complete histologic classification for ovarian cancer from the WHO \ndescribes the different types of LCOC . Panel members believe there is \nvalue in identifying pathways that may serve as therapeutic targets for the \nLCOC  because of the promise of new and novel approaches to treatment. \nHowever, there are limited data for these rare histologies because of their \ninfrequency and it will be difficult to acquire prospective data. Clinical trials \nfor eligible patients, and indiv idualized treatment plans for those  who are \nnot eligible for trials, may be the most suitable approaches to treatment in \nthese patients at this time.  \nMost ovarian cancers, including the LCOC , are diagnosed after pathologic \nanalysis of a biopsy or surgical specimen. Based on published improved \noutcomes, it is recommended (category 1) that a gynecologic oncologist \nperform the primary surgery. Primary treatment for presumed ovarian \ncancer consis ts of appropriate surgical staging and debulking surgery, \nfollowed in most (but not all) patients by systemic chemotherapy. \nDebulking surgery is the initial treatment recommendation for patients with \nclinical stage I I, III, or IV disease. For most patients, initial surgery should \ninclude hysterectomy, BSO, and debulking as needed. Procedures that \nmay be considered for optimal surgical debulking include: radical pelvic \ndissection, bowel resection and/or appendectomy, l ymphadenectomy, \ndiaphragm or other peritoneal surface stripping, splenectomy, partial \nhepatectomy, partial gastrectomy, or partial cystectomy and/or \nureteroneocystostomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy. \nMost patients have a hysterectomy with  BSO, omentectomy, and \nlymphadenectomy of suspicious/enlarged nodes. Patients with low -volume \nresidual disease after surgical debulking for stage II or III invasive \nepithelial ovarian or peritoneal cancer are candidates for IP therapy. In these patients, consideration should be given to placement of an IP \ncatheter with initial surgery. In those  with optimally debulked stage III \ncancer, the IP regimen has yielded median survival of 65.6 months. In \nthose  receiving a dose -dense weekly paclitaxel/carboplatin re gimen, \nmedian OS was 100.5 months.  \nFor a young patient who wishes to maintain fertility, a USO (preserving the \nuterus and contralateral ovary) and comprehensive surgical staging may \nbe adequate for select unilateral stage I tumors (stage 1A and 1C, but not \nstage 1B) and/or low -risk ovarian tumors (ie, early -stage, grade 1 tumors; \nborderline tumors). For those with stage IB tumors who wish to maintain \nfertility, a BSO (preserving the uterus) and comprehensive surgical staging \nare recommended.  \nMost patients with epithelial ovarian cancer receive postoperative systemic \nchemotherapy. Consideration of palliative care interventions is appropriate \nat several stages during the disease course. Recommendations regarding \ninitial primary systemic therapy include IV with [or without] IP options. All \nof the regimens (including the combined IV/IP chemotherapy) may be \nused for epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, and Fallopian tube cancers; \nsome of these regimens are recommended for some of the LCOC . NACT  \nmay be considered (category 1) for patients with bulky stage III to IV \ndisease or high -risk surgical candidates; a gynecologic oncologist should \nmake this assessment before NACT  is administered.  \nFor all patients, the NCCN Guidelines recommend symptom management, \nbest supportive care, and long -term wellness care; patients should be \nreferred for palliative care assessment if appropriate. Patients should be \neducated about signs and symptoms suggestiv e of recurrence such as \npelvic pain, bloating, early satiety, obstruction, weight loss, and fatigue. \nRecurrent disease may be identified clinically (eg, pelvic pain, weight \nloss), biochemically (ie, elevated CA -125 levels), and/or with imaging.
