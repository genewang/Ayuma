Distinguishing SCLC from other neuroendocrine tumors, particularly typical and atypical carcinoids, \nis important due to significant differences in epidemiology, genetics, treatment, and prognosis.4-6\n• SCLC can be diagnosed on good-quality histologic samples via high-quality hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections or on well-preserved cytologic \nsamples.  \n\u0017SCLC is characterized by small blue cells with scant cytoplasm, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, granular chromatin, and absent or inconspicuous nucleoli.\n\u0017SCLC cells are round, oval, or spindle-shaped with molding and high mitotic counts.7-9\n\u0017The most useful characteristics for distinguishing SCLC from large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) are the high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and \npaucity of nucleoli in SCLC.\n• Careful counting of mitoses is essential, because it is the most important histologic criterion for distinguishing SCLC from typical and atypical carcinoids. \nStrongly recommend a second opinion—with a pathologist specializing in the diagnosis of thoracic malignancies—for diagnostic dilemma, including carcinoid.\n\u0017SCLC (>10 mitoses/2 mm2 field); atypical carcinoid (2–10 mitoses/2 mm2 field); typical carcinoid (0–1 mitoses/2 mm2 field) \n\u0017Mitoses should be counted in the areas of highest activity and per 2 mm2 field, rather than per 10 high-power fields. \n\u0017In tumors that are near the defined cutoffs of 2 or 10 mitoses per 2 mm2, at least three 2-mm2 fields should be counted and the calculated mean (rather than the \nsingle highest mitotic count) should be used to determine the overall mitotic rate.1,2\n• SCLC is often associated with necrosis. However, necrosis, usually punctate, is also seen in atypical carcinoid tumors. Counting mitotic figures helps to \ndistinguish these two entities.\n• Combined SCLC consists of both SCLC histology and NSCLC histology (squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, spindle/pleomorphic, and/or large cell). There is no \nminimal percentage of NSCLC histologic elements required; when any are present along with SCLC, this can be called combined SCLC, except in combination \nwith LCNEC. At least 10% of the tumor should show LCNEC morphology to be classified as combined SCLC and LCNEC.1\n• Comprehensive molecular profiling can be considered in rare cases—particularly for patients with extensive stage/relapsed SCLC who do not smoke \ntobacco, lightly smoke (<10 cigarettes/day), have remote smoking history, or have diagnostic or therapeutic dilemma, or at time of relapse—if not \npreviously done, because this may change management.\nImmunohistochemical Staining\n• Immunohistochemistry can be very helpful in diagnosing SCLC in limited samples.5,7\n\u0017Nearly all SCLCs are positive for cytokeratin antibody mixtures with broad reactivity, such as AE1/AE3 and CAM5.2.1,10\n\u0017The majority of SCLCs are reactive to markers of neuroendocrine differentiation, including insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1), CD56/NCAM, \nsynaptophysin, and chromogranin A. Fewer than 5% of SCLCs are negative for all neuroendocrine markers.11,12 For cases with suspicious SCLC morphology \nwithout expression of neuroendocrine markers, POU2F3 immunohistochemical staining can be considered.13,14\n\u0017Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is positive in 85% to 90% of SCLCs.15-18\n\u0017Additional immunohistochemical markers are useful in distinguishing small cell carcinoma from poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma and combined \ncarcinoma using Napsin A as a marker of adenocarcinoma, and p40 or p63 as a marker of squamous differentiation.10 It should, however, be noted that p40 and \np63 can be focally positive in small cell carcinoma.\n• Ki-67 immunostaining can be very helpful in distinguishing SCLC from carcinoid tumors, especially in small biopsy samples with crushed or necrotic tumor cells \nin which counting mitotic figures is difficult.4,5\n\u0017The Ki-67 proliferative index in SCLC is typically 50% to 100%.1\nReferences on \nSCL-B 2 of 2PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

This \nmay also include an endoscopic staging procedure.\n\u0017For patients undergoing definitive surgical resection, the preferred operation is lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection or \nsystematic lymph node sampling (eg, ≥3 N2 and ≥1 N1 stations).3,4,5,6,7\n• In patients who do not smoke, small lesions that are presumed to be small cell carcinoma on biopsy should be resected because they are \nlikely carcinoids that have been misdiagnosed ( NCCN Guidelines for Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors).\n• Surgery may be considered for selected patients with T3 (based on size), N0 SCLC, if invasive mediastinal lymph node staging is negative.\n• Intraoperative diagnosis of likely SCLC in a patient with no prior biopsy \n\u0017Mediastinal lymph node dissection or systematic lymph node sampling with frozen section is recommended to assess extent of disease \nand overall burden of disease.\n\u0017If primary site and lymph nodes appear resectable, perform anatomic resection, preferably lobectomy. Should not do pneumonectomy if \nneeded to encompass nodal metastatic disease.\n• Patients who undergo complete resection should be treated with postoperative systemic therapy.8 Patients without nodal metastases \nshould be treated with systemic therapy alone. Patients with N2 or N3 nodal metastases should be treated with postoperative concurrent \nor sequential systemic therapy and mediastinal RT. Patients with N1 nodal metastases may be considered for postoperative mediastinal \nradiation.\n• The benefit of PCI is unclear in patients who have undergone definitive therapy for pathologic stage I (T1-2a,N0,M0); see SCL-F . \nSCL-C1 Lad T, Piantadosi S, Thomas P, et al.

Radiation oncology input, as part of a \nmultidisciplinary evaluation or discussion, should be provided for all patients early in the determination of the treatment strategy .\n• To maximize tumor control and to minimize treatment toxicity, critical components of modern RT include appropriate simulation, accurate \ntarget definition, conformal RT (CRT) planning, and ensuring accurate delivery of the planned treatment. A minimum standard is CT -planned \n3D-CRT conformal RT. Multiple fields should be used, with all fields treated daily.\n• Use of more advanced technologies is appropriate when needed to deliver adequate tumor doses while respecting normal tissue dose \nconstraints. Such technologies include (but are not limited to) 4D-CT and/or FDG-PET/CT simulation, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT)/\nvolumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), image-guided RT (IGRT), and motion management strategies. IMRT is preferred over 3D conformal \nEBRT on the basis of reduced toxicity in the setting of concurrent chemotherapy/RT.1 Quality assurance measures are essential and are \ncovered in the NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCL-C) .\n• Useful references include the ASTRO Guidelines  and the American Radium Society.2,3,4\nGeneral Treatment Information:\nLimited Stage:\n• In patients with clinical stage I–IIA (T1–2, N0, M0) who have undergone lobectomy and are found to have regional nodal involvement on \nfinal pathology, postoperative RT is recommended in pathologic N25 and may be considered in pathologic N1 stage, either sequentially or \nconcurrently with chemotherapy. Principles of postoperative RT for NSCLC, including target volumes and doses, are recommended.\n• Selected patients with stage I–IIA (T1–2, N0, M0) SCLC who are medically inoperable or in whom a decision is made not to pursue surgery \nmay be candidates for stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also known as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), to the primary tumor followed \nby adjuvant systemic therapy. Principles of SABR for SCLC are similar to those for NSCLC (see  NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung \nCancer: NSCL-C ).6-8\n• Timing: RT concurrent with systemic therapy is standard and preferred to sequential chemo/RT.9 RT should start early, with cycle 1 or 2 of \nsystemic therapy (category 1).10 A shorter time from the start of any therapy to the end of RT (SER) is significantly associated with improved \nsurvival.11\n• Target definition: RT target volumes should be defined based on the pretreatment FDG-PET scan and CT scan obtained at the time of RT \nplanning, as well as any positive biopsies. FDG-PET/CT is recommended, preferably within 4 weeks and no more than 8 weeks, before \ntreatment. Ideally, FDG-PET/CT should be obtained in the treatment position.\nReferences  \n(SCL-F 5 of  7)ContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

Several more modern series, both retrospective and prospective, suggest that omission of elective nodal \nirradiation (ENI) results in low rates of isolated nodal recurrences (0%–1 1%, most <5%), particularly when incorporating FDG-PET staging/\ntarget definition (1.7%–3%).12-17 ENI has been omitted in recent prospective clinical trials (including CALGB 30610/RTOG 0538 and the \nEORTC 08072 [CONVERT] trial). Inclusion of the ipsilateral hilum in the target volume, even if not grossly involved, differs between these \ntrials but may be reasonable.\n• In patients who start systemic therapy before RT, the gross tumor volume (GTV) can be limited to the post-induction systemic therapy \nvolume to avoid excessive toxicity. Initially involved nodal regions (but not their entire pre-systemic therapy volume) should be covered.14,18 \n• Dose and schedule: For limited-stage SCLC, the optimal dose and schedule of RT have not been established.\n\u0017Based on the randomized phase III trial, INT 0096, 45 Gy in 3 weeks (1.5 Gy twice daily [BID]) is superior (category 1) to 45 Gy in 5 weeks \n(1.8 Gy daily).19,20 When BID fractionation is used, there should be at least a 6-hour interfraction interval to allow for repair of normal \ntissue. \n\u0017Retrospective and randomized phase II studies from Norway and Canada suggest that similarly accelerated doses of 40–42 Gy in 3 weeks \nbut given in once-daily fractionation produce similar outcomes as 45 Gy in 3 weeks in BID fractionation, though regional practice between \ndaily and twice daily fractionation has diverged between those countries after subsequent experience.21,22,23\n\u0017If using once-daily conventionally fractionated RT, higher doses of 66–70 Gy are preferred. 24-27 Two randomized phase III trials did not \ndemonstrate superiority of 66 Gy in 6.5 weeks/2 Gy daily (the European CONVERT trial) or 70 Gy in 7 weeks/2 Gy daily (CALGB 30610/RTOG \n0538) over 45 Gy in 3 weeks/1.5 Gy BID, but overall survival and toxicity were similar.28,29,30\n\u0017Recent randomized phase II trials suggest that higher dose accelerated RT of 60–65 Gy in 4–5 weeks given in BID or daily fractionation may \nproduce increased overall or progression-free survival compared to 45 Gy in 3 weeks in BID fractionation.31,32\nExtensive Stage:\n• Consolidative thoracic RT is beneficial for selected patients with ES-SCLC with complete response or good response to systemic therapy  \nbefore immunotherapy, especially with residual thoracic disease and low-bulk extrathoracic metastatic disease. Studies have demonstrated \nthat consolidative thoracic RT up to definitive doses is well-tolerated, results in fewer symptomatic chest recurrences, and improves \nlong-term survival in some patients.33,34 The Dutch CREST randomized trial of modest-dose thoracic RT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) in patients \nwith ES-SCLC that responded to chemotherapy (without immunotherapy) demonstrated significantly improved 2-year overall survival \nand 6-month progression-free survival, although the protocol-defined primary endpoint of 1-year overall survival was not significantly \nimproved.32 Subsequent exploratory analysis found the benefit of consolidative thoracic RT is limited to the majority of patients who had \nresidual thoracic disease after systemic therapy.36 \n• Dosing and fractionation of consolidative thoracic RT should be individualized within the range of 30 Gy in 10 daily fractions up to definitive \ndosing regimens in patients with a longer life expectancy.\nNormal Tissue Dose Constraints, Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (SCL-F 3 of 7)\nBrain Metastasis (SCL-F 4 of 7)ContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion\nSCL-F\n3 OF 7PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY\nReferences  \n(SCL-F 5 of  7)Extensive Stage (continued):\n• Based on two randomized trials, immunotherapy during and after chemotherapy is a first-line approach,37,38 but these studies did not include \nconsolidative thoracic RT. Nevertheless, consolidative thoracic RT after chemoimmunotherapy can be considered for selected patients as above, \nduring or before maintenance immunotherapy (there are limited data on optimal sequencing or safety). The benefit of thoracic RT in the context of \nchemo-immunotherapy is under evaluation in the RAPTOR/NRG LU007 trial.\nNormal Tissue Dose Constraints:\n• Normal tissue dose constraints depend on tumor size and location. For similar RT prescription doses, the normal tissue constraints used for \nNSCLC are appropriate (see  NSCL -C).\n• When administering accelerated RT schedules (eg, BID) or lower total RT doses (eg, 45 Gy), more conservative constraints should be used. When \nusing accelerated schedules (eg, 3–5 weeks), the spinal cord constraints from the CALGB 30610/RTOG 0538 protocol should be used as a guide: ie, \nthe maximum spinal cord dose should be limited to ≤41 Gy (including scatter irradiation) for a prescription of 45 Gy BID in 3 weeks and limited to \n≤50 Gy for more protracted schedules.\nProphylactic Cranial Irradiation :  \n• In patients with limited stage SCLC (LS-SCLC) who have a good response to initial therapy, PCI decreases brain metastases and increased overall \nsurvival39,40 in meta-analyses of past clinical trials. Of note, none of the past studies that have been used as the basis for PCI recommendations in \nLS-SCLC employed MRI staging of the brain nor did any utilize FDG-PET scans for overall staging. \n• The benefit of PCI is unclear in patients who have undergone definitive therapy for very early LS-SCLC, ie, pathologic stage I–IIA  (T1–2,N0,M0).41 \nThese patients have a lower risk of developing brain metastases than patients with more advanced, LS-SCLC and may not benefit from PCI.41 Brain \nMRI surveillance is recommended in patients not receiving PCI.41 However, PCI may have a benefit in patients who are found to have pathologic \nstage IIB or III SCLC after complete resection.40,41 This issue is being evaluated in the ongoing NCI cooperative group trial SWOG S1827/MAVERICK \n(brain MRI surveillance ± PCI), which includes the population undergoing surgical resection ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04155034).\n• In patients with ES-SCLC that has responded to systemic therapy, PCI decreases brain metastases. A randomized trial conducted by the European \nOrganisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) found improved overall survival with PCI.42 However, a Japanese randomized trial \nfound that in patients who had no brain metastases on baseline MRI, PCI did not improve overall survival compared with routine surveillance MRI \nand treatment of asymptomatic brain metastases upon detection .43 Surveillance imaging for brain metastases is recommended for all patients \nregardless of PCI status.\n• The preferred dose for PCI to the whole brain is 25 Gy in 10 daily fractions. A shorter course (eg, 20 Gy in 5 fractions) may be appropriate in \nselected patients with extensive stage disease. In a large randomized trial (PCI 99-01), patients receiving a dose of 36 Gy had higher mortality and \nhigher chronic neurotoxicity compared to patients treated with 25 Gy .44,45\n• Neurocognitive function: Increasing age and higher doses are the most predictive factors for development of chronic neurotoxicity. In trial RTOG \n0212, 83% of patients >60 years experienced chronic neurotoxicity 12 months after PCI versus 56% of patients <60 years ( P = .009).45 PCI is not \nrecommended in patients with poor PS or impaired neurocognitive function .44 The role of PCI in MRI and FDG-PET staged SCLC in fit patients with \nnormal neurocognitive function is the subject of ongoing debate, particularly in limited stage, and is being evaluated in the phase III SWOG S1827/\nMAVERICK trial comparing PCI (active comparator) to MRI surveillance (experimental) in both limited and extensive stage ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/\nct2/show/NCT04155034 ).\nBrain Metastasis (SCL-F 4 of 7)ContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

PCI is not recommended in patients with poor  PS or impaired \nneurocognitive functioning.\n• When administering PCI, consider adding memantine during and after RT, which has been shown to  decrease neurocognitive impairment \nfollowing whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for brain metastases.46 The dose of memantine used on RTOG 0614 was as follows: week \n1 (starting on day 1 of WBRT), 5 mg each morning; week 2, 5 mg each morning and evening; week 3, 10 mg each morning and 5 mg each \nevening; and weeks 4–24, 10 mg each morning and evening  (see NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers ).\n• Hippocampal-avoidance (HA) PCI using IMRT may be considered as a potential strategy to improve cognitive preservation. A phase \nIII randomized trial of HA-WBRT versus conventional WBRT demonstrated improved cognitive preservation and patient-reported \noutcomes with HA-WBRT in patients with brain metastases from mixed histologies.47 Conflicting data have been reported with HA-PCI \nversus conventional PCI in SCLC with one trial reporting no differences in cognition48 and a separate trial reporting improved cognitive \npreservation with HA-PCI.49 A larger randomized trial of HA-PCI versus conventional PCI, NRG CC003 ,50 has completed accrual with results \npending.51\n• An ongoing randomized trial, SWOG S1827/MAVERICK, is evaluating whether brain MRI surveillance alone is non-inferior to MRI surveillance \nplus PCI with regard to overall survival for LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC.52 \nBrain Metastases :\n• Brain metastases have conventionally been treated with WBRT; however, selected patients with a small number of metastases may be \nappropriately treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT)/radiosurgery (SRS).53 A current randomized trial, NRG CC009 , is comparing SRS \nto hippocampal-sparing WBRT plus memantine in this setting.\n• Recommended dose for WBRT is 30 Gy in 10 daily fractions. Consider adding memantine during and after RT (see Prophylactic Cranial \nIrradiation for memantine dosing).46\n• In patients who develop brain metastases after PCI, repeat WBRT may be considered in carefully selected patients.54,55 SRS is preferred, if \nfeasible.56,57\n• For patients with a better prognosis (eg, ≥4 months), hippocampal-sparing WBRT using IMRT plus memantine is preferred because it \nproduces less cognitive function failure than conventional WBRT plus memantine.47 However, patients with metastases within 5 mm of the \nhippocampi, leptomeningeal metastases, and other high-risk features were not eligible for hippocampal-sparing WBRT on NRG CC001 .47 \nAlthough CC001 did not include patients with brain metastases from SCLC, it is reasonable to extrapolate the findings to SCLC.\nPalliative Radiation for Extracranial Metastases :\n• Common radiation dose-fractionation regimens (eg, 30 Gy in 10 fractions, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 8 Gy in 1 fraction) used for palliation of other \nsolid tumors are appropriate for palliation of SCLC metastases in most patients.\n• Conformal techniques, such as IMRT, and/or higher dose intensity approaches, including SABR or SRS, may be appropriate in selected \npatients (eg, tumors with close proximity to organs at risk, reirradiation, or better prognosis).PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY\nReferences  \n(SCL-F 5 of  7)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nSmall Cell Lung Cancer   \n \nMS-2 Overview  \nNeuroendocrine tumors account for approximately  20% of lung cancers; of \nwhich nearly  14% are small cell lung cancer ( SCLC).1 In 2024 , an \nestimated 33,000  new cases of SCLC will be  diagnosed  in the United \nStates.1,2 Although the incidence of SCLC has been decreasing, the \nfrequency  in females  is increasing and the male -to-female incidence ratio \nis now close to 1:1.1 Nearly all cases of SCLC are attributable to cigarette \nsmoking.3 Patients with SCLC who also continue to smoke tobacco during \ntreatment have increased toxicity and shorter survival.4 Therefore, tobacco \nsmoking cessation counseling and intervention should be strongly \npromoted in patients with SCLC and other high -grade neuroendocrine \ncarcinomas  (see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation,  available \nat www.NCCN.org ).5 Patients who previously smoked tobacco should be \nstrongly encouraged to remain abstinent. Programs using behavioral \ncounseling combined with U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA)-approved  medic ations that promote smoking cessation can be very \nuseful.  \nSCLC is characterized by a rapid doubling time, high growth fraction, and \nearly development of widespread metastases. Most patients with SCLC \npresent with hematogenous metastases; approximately  one third present \nwith limited disease confined to the chest. Although 95% of small cell \ncarcinomas originate in the lung, they can also arise from extrapulmonary \nsites, including the nasopharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary \ntract.6,7 Both pulmonary and extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas have a \nsimilar clinical and biologic behavior  with increased potential for \nwidespread metastases.  Management of SCLC is described in the NCCN \nClinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Small \nCell Lung Cancer  that includes the algorithm and this supporting \nDiscussion text. Management of other lung neuroendocrine tumors (LNTs) \nand Non-Small C ell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) are  described in the NCCN Guidelines for Neuroendo crine and Adrenal Tumors  and Non -Small Cell \nLung Cancer , respectively , available at www.N CCN .org. \nThe definitions for limited -stage and extensive -stage SCLC incorporate \nTNM staging. The Panel recommends that the workup for SCLC should be \nexpedited and if possible, studies should be performed in parallel . In \npatients with limited -stage SCLC, the goal of treatment is cure using \nchemotherapy plus thoracic radiation therapy ( RT). However, some \npatients with resectable tumors (stage I –IIA) are eligible for curative \nsurgery followed by systemic therapy with or without mediastinal RT.8,9 \nThe Panel recommends multidisciplinary evaluation before any surgery. In \nother patients with stage I –IIA SCLC, includ ing medically inoperable \ncircumstances or when the decision not to pursue surgical resection is \nmade,  stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) followed by systemic \ntherapy is an option .10-15 The benefits of prophylactic cranial irradiation \n(PCI) are unclear in patients with stage I SCLC (T1 –2a, N0, M0) who have \nreceived definitive therapy. The NCCN Panel recommend s that MRI brain \nsurveillance be considered for all patients with limited -stage SCLC who do \nnot receive PCI.  In most patients with extensive -stage SCLC , systemic \ntherapy with or without RT  can palliate symptoms and prolong survival; \nhowever, long -term survival is rare.16 SCLC is highly sensitive to initial \nchemotherapy and RT; however, most patients eventually die of recurrent \ndisease.17 Despite recent advances, the recommended therapy options for \nSCLC need improv ement . Clinical trials generally represent \nstate -of-the-art treatment for patients with SCLC. Thus, participation in \nclinical trials is strongly encouraged.   \nGuidelines Update Methodology   \nThe NCCN Guidelines® for Small Cell Lung Cancer  were originally \npublished in 1996  and have been subsequently updated at least once \nevery year .18 The complete details of the Development and Update of the \nNCCN Guidelines are available at www.N CCN .org.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nSmall Cell Lung Cancer   \n \nMS-3 Literature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung \nCarcinoma, a n electronic search of the PubMed database was performed \nto obtain key literature in SCLC  using the following search term:  (small cell \nlung cancer OR small cell carcinoma lung) NOT (non -small) . The PubMed \ndatabase was chosen because it is the most widely used resource for \nmedical literature and it indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.19  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English . Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial; Clinical Trial, Phase 2; Clinical Trial, Phase 3; Clinical Trial, \nPhase 4; Guideline; Practice Guidelines; Randomized Controlled Trial; \nMeta -Analysis; Systematic Reviews; Validation Studies ; and Multicenter \nStudy . The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from \nadditional sources deemed as relevant to these NCCN Guidelines have \nbeen included i n this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations \nfor which high -level evidence is lacking are based on the Panel’s review of \nlower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.20 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person -first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and \ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  \nNCCN Guidelines incorporate non -gendered language, instead focusing \non organ -specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collecte d and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to colle ct more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in subsequent  analyses.   \nDiagnosis  \nScreening  \nIdeally, a screening test should detect disease at an early stage when it is \nstill curable. The National Lung Screening Trial reported that screening \nwith annual, low -dose, spiral CT scans detected early -stage NSCLC and \ndecreased lung cancer -specific mortality in asymptomatic high -risk \nindividuals (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening , \navailable at www.N CCN .org).21 Low-dose CT is probably not useful for \nSCLC screening because symptomatic disease can develop between \nannual scans  due to the aggressive nature of the disease ; thereby limiting \nthe potential reduction  of mortality  through screening .21-24  \nManifestations  \nPatients with SCLC typically present with a large hilar mass and bulky \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy that cause s cough and dyspnea.25 \nFrequently, patients present with symptoms of widespread metastatic \ndisease, such as weight loss, debility, bone pain, and neurologic \ncompromise. It is uncommon for patients to present with a solitary \nperipheral nodule without central adenopathy. In this situation, fine -needle \naspiration (FNA) may not adequately differentiate small cell carcinoma \n(which is a high -grade neuroendocrine carcinoma) from low -grade (typical \ncarcinoid), intermediate -grade (atypical carcinoid), or large -cell \nneuroendocrine carcino ma (LCNEC) (which is also a high -grade \nneuroendocrine carcinoma) (see Lung Neuro endocrine Tumors  in the \nNCCN Guidelines for Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors, available at \nwww.N CCN .org).26,27  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nSmall Cell Lung Cancer   \n \nMS-4 Many neurologic and endocrine paraneoplastic syndromes , including  \nLambert -Eaton myasthenic syndrome, encephalomyelitis, and sensory \nneuropathy , are associated with SCLC.28-30 Given the occurrence of \nparaneoplastic neurologic syndromes in individuals with SCLC, the Panel \nrecommends considering early subspecialty consultation for most recent \nmanagement . Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis may precede a diagnosis  \nof SCLC .31 The NCCN SCLC Panel recommends considering a \ncomprehensive paraneoplastic antibody panel  and/or neurologic \nconsultation  if neurologic paraneoplastic syndrome is suspected .  \nSCLC tumors  sometimes produce polypeptide hormones, including \nvasopressin and adrenocorticotropic hormone  that cause syndrome of \ninappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) and Cushing syndrome, \nrespectively.32,33 In patients  with SCLC, SIADH occurs more frequently \nthan Cushing syndrome. Primary treatment for SIADH includes fluid \nrestriction (which is difficult for patients because of increased thirst) and \ndemeclocycline . Cancer treatment (e.g., cisplatin ) and/or supportive care \n(e.g., opiates) may also cause hyponatremia .34 Hyponatremia usually \nimprove s after successful treatment of SCLC.  However, v asopressin \nreceptor inhibitors (i .e., conivaptan, tolvaptan) can be used for refractory \nhyponatremia.34-36  \nPathology  \nSCLC is a poorly differentiated malignant epithelial tumor that is \ncategorized as a high -grade neuroendocrine carcinoma .26,37 Up to 30% of \ntumors  from patients with SCLC reveal areas of NSCLC differentiation \n(mainly large cell carcinoma) .38 This finding is more common in patients \nwho have received previous treatment . The classic and distinctive \nhistology on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) , including small blue cells with \nscant cytoplasm, high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio , fine granular nuclear \nchromatin, and absent or inconspicuous nucleoli , may be sufficient for \nidentifying SCLC in good -quality histologic samples.26,39 The mit otic count \nis high  in SCLC compared with the count in atypical and typical carcinoids. However, mitotic figures are difficult to count  in small biopsy samples with \ncrushed or necrotic cells . In such samples  immunohistochemistry is \nuseful .40 In cases of diagnostic dilemma, including carcinoids, the Panel \nstrongly recommends getting a second opinion with a pathologist \nspecializing in diagnosis of thoracic malignancies.   \nUsing i mmunohistochemistry as one of the tools to diagnos e and \ndistinguish SCLC from NSCLC or other neuroendocrine tumors  is \nimportant ; especially because these  cancer type s have different treatment \nrecommendations .26,40 -44 Ki-67 is useful for distinguishing SCLC from \ncarcinoid tumors.40,44 -46 Nearly all SCLCs are immunoreactive for \ncytokeratin (AE1/Ae3, CAM5.2)  and 85% to 90% of SCLCs are positive for \nthyroid transcription factor -1 (TTF -1).26,47 -49 Most SCLCs (~95%) stain \npositively for markers of neuroendocrine differentiation, including \ninsulinoma -associated protein 1 (INSM1), chromogranin A, NCAM (CD56), \nand synaptophysin.26,50,51 However, at least one of these neuroendocrine \nmarkers  will be immunoreactive  in approximately 10% of NSCLCs and \ntherefore cannot be used alone to distinguish SCLC from NSCLC.52 For \nsuspicious cases of SCLC morphology without any expression of \nneuroendocrine markers, POU2F3 IHC staining can be considered.53,54 \nNapsin A (adenocarcinoma marker) and p40 (or p63, squamous cell \ncarcinoma marker) are generally negative in SCLC and useful for \ndistinguishing SCLC from poorly differentiated NSCLC and combined \nSCLC.55 However , p40 (or p63) can be focally positive in SCLC.  For \nv1.202 5, the Panel clarified that comprehensive molecular profiling via \nblood, tissue, or both may be considered in rare cases, particularly for \npatients with extensive -stage/relapsed SCLC who have never smoked or \nlightly smoked, remote smoking history, for diagnostic/pathologic dilemma , \nor at time of relapse  if not done previously because this may change \nmanagement .56-61  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nSmall Cell Lung Cancer   \n \nMS-5 The WHO classification recognizes two types of SCLC: pure and \ncombined SCLC.44,57,62 -65 Combined SCLC , which consists of both SCLC \nand NSCLC histology (squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, \nspindle/pleomorphic, and/or large cell carcinoma), is more frequent in \npatients with limited -stage SCLC .44,57,64,66 Any presence of NSCLC \nhistolog y (no minimal percentage)  results in a classification of combined \nSCLC. The only exception is combined SCLC and LCNEC  where a t least \n10% of the tumor should show LCNEC morphology.38,67 Patients with \ncombined SCLC are treated using regimens for SCLC, because it is the \nmore aggressive cancer.67 Patients with NSCLC can also transform to \nSCLC after treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) \ntyrosine kinase inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors.68,69  \nEvaluation  \nStaging Systems  \nThe Veterans Administration ( VA) Lung Study Group’s 2 -stage \nclassification scheme has historically been used to define the extent of \ndisease in patients with SCLC: 1) limited -stage is disease confined to the \nipsilateral hemithorax, which can be safely encompassed within a radiation \nfield; and 2) extensive -stage is disease beyond the ipsilateral hemithorax, \nincluding malignant pleural /pericardial effusion or hematogenous \nmetastases.70 Contr alateral mediastinal and ipsilateral supraclavicular \nlymphadenopathy are generally classified as limited -stage SCLC , whereas \nthe classification of contralateral hilar and supraclavicular \nlymphadenopathy is more controversial and treatment is \nindividualized.17,71,72 Approximately 66% of patients present with overt \nhematogenous metastases, which commonly involve the contralateral \nlung, liver, adrenal glands, brain, bones, and/or bone marrow.  Most \nstudies use the  VA definitions of limited -stage or extensive -stage SCLC , \nfor clinical decision -making. However, the TNM system is useful for \nselecting patients with T1–2, N0 disease who are eligible for surgery and \nRT.71 The American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC ) revised the TNM staging system (8th edition) for lung cancer in 2017 .73,74 Clinical research \nstudies that include use of  the TNM system  will allow for more precise \nassessments of prognosis and specific therapy.73  \nThe NCCN SCLC Panel adopted a combined approach of using both the \nAJCC TNM staging system and the older  VA scheme for SCLC  \nstaging .17,71 Limited -stage SCLC is defined as stage I –III (T any,  N any, \nM0) that can be safely treated with definitive RT. This  exclud es T3–4 due \nto multiple extensive lung nodules or disease with tumor/nodal volume that \nis too large to be encompassed in a tolerable radiation plan. \nExtensive -stage SCLC is defined as stage IV (T any,  N any,  M1a/b/c) or \nT3–4 as previously described.  \nInitial  Evaluation  \nThe workup for SCLC should be expedited with studies done in parallel \nwhenever possible.  Staging should not delay the onset of treatment for \nmore than 1 week because of the aggressive nature of SCLC . Many \npatients may become more ser iously ill in the interval, with a significant \ndecline in their performance status (PS). Staging primarily provides a \ntherapeutic guideline for thoracic RT for pa tients with limited -stage SCLC . \nThe Panel recommend s integration of palliative care so that management \nof cancer -related symptoms and goals of care are discussed  during initial \nevaluation.  \nThe initial diagnostic evaluation includes a history and physical \nexamination; pathology review; clinical laboratory  tests; CT scan with \nintravenous contrast of the chest/abdomen/pelvis; and MRI (preferred) or \nCT scan with intravenous contrast  for brain imaging .72,75 An FDG -PET/CT \nscan (skull base to mid -thigh) , which is superior to PET alone, is \nrecommended to clarify the extent of disease  if needed .17,71,76 For most \nmetastatic sites, FDG -PET/CT is superior to CT imaging; however, FDG -\nPET/CT is inferior to MRI (or contrast -enhanced CT  as an alternative \nwhen MRI is not possible)  for the detection of brain met astases (see the PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nSmall Cell Lung Cancer   \n \nMS-6 NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers,  available at \nwww. NCCN.org ).77 FDG -PET scans can also increase staging accuracy in \npatients with SCLC, because SCLC is a highly metabolic disease.76,78,79 \nApproximately 19% of patients who undergo FDG -PET are upstaged from \nlimited -stage to extensive -stage SCLC , whereas 8% are down  staged from \nextensive -stage to limited -stage SCLC .72 Although FDG -PET/CT seems to \nimprove staging accuracy in SCLC, pathologic confirmation is \nrecommended  for isolated  or equivocal lesions if their involvement \nchanges clinical management . FDG -PET staging altered the planned \nradiation field  because  of improved detection of intrathoracic disease sites \nin approximately 27% of patients .72,79,80 \nOnce a patient has been found to have extensive -stage SCLC , further \nstaging is optional  and dependent on the clinical situation . However , brain \nimaging  MRI (preferred), or CT with contrast is recommended . Brain \nimaging ( preferably MRI or CT with contrast) can identify central nervous \nsystem (CNS) metastases in 10% to 15% of patients at diagnosis, of \nwhich approximately 30% are asymptomatic. Therefore, s taging should \nnot focus only on sites of symptomatic disease or on sites suggested by \nlaboratory tests.  Early treatment of brain metastases results in less chronic \nneurologic morbidity, arguing  for the usefulness of early diagnosis in \nasymptomatic patients.  \nBone imaging with radiographs or MRI  can be performed if FDG -PET/CT \nis equivocal or not available; bone biopsy can be further considered if \nbone imaging is also equivocal.  Bone scans are positive in up to 30% of \npatients without bone pain or without abnormal alkaline phosphatase \nlevels. However, l ess than 5% of patients have b one marrow involvement \nas the only site of extensive -stage SCLC . Unilateral bone marrow \naspirates and biopsies may be indicated in select patients with no other \nevidence of metastatic disease , with nucleated red blood cells on \nperipheral blood smear  and neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia suggestive of bone marrow infiltration . Any compelling evidence of distant disease \nconsistent with malignancy should change the diagnosis to extensive -\nstage disease.   \nBefore surgical resection  in patients with clinical limited stage I –IIA SCLC \n(T1–2, N0, M0), pathologic mediastinal staging is recommended to confirm \nFDG -PET/CT scan results and rule out occult nodal disease .17 To help \ndetermine RT fields , mediastinal staging can be considered for clinical \nstage IIB –IIIC SCLC (T1 –4, N0, M0; T1 -4, N1-3, M0), especially for those \nwith clinical N0  disease . Invasive mediastinal staging can be performed \neither by conventional mediastinoscopy or by minimally invasive \ntechniques such as transesophageal endoscopic ultrasound -guided FNA \n(EUS -FNA), endobronchial ultrasound -guided transbronchial needle \naspiration (EBUS -TBNA), or video -assisted thoracic surgery (VATS).81,82 If \nthe endoscopic lymph node biopsy is positive, then additional mediastinal \nstaging is not recommended.  \nThoracentesis with cytologic analysis is recommended if pleural effusion is \nlarge enough to be safely accessed via ultrasound guidance. If \nthoracentesis does not show malignant cells, then thoracoscopy can be \nconsidered to document pleural involvement , which is suggest ive of \nextensive -stage SCLC . The effusion should be excluded as a staging \nelement if: 1) multiple cytopathologic examinations of the pleural fluid are \nnegative for cancer; 2) the fluid is not bloody and not an exudate; and 3) \nclinical judgment concludes  that the effusion is not directly related to the \ncancer. Pericardial effusions are classified using the same criteria.  \nPrognostic Factors  \nPoor PS (3 –4), extensive -stage SCLC , weight loss, and markers , such as \nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH), associated with bulk y disease are the most \nimportant adverse prognostic factors. Age <70 years, normal LDH, and \nstage I disease are associated with favorable prognosis in patients with \nlimited -stage SCLC . Younger age, good PS, normal creatinine level, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nSmall Cell Lung Cancer   \n \nMS-7 normal LDH, and a single metastatic site are favorable prognostic factors \nin patients with extensive -stage SCLC .83,84  \nTreatment   \nSurgical Resection of Stage I –IIA SCLC  \nSurgery is only recommended for certain patients with stage I –IIA SCLC ; \nwith only about 5% of patients eligible for surgery . Concurrent \nchemoradiation or SABR followed by systemic therapy is recommended \nfor patients with limited -stage I –IIA (T1 –2, N0, M0) SCLC who are \nmedically inoperable or do not want to pursue surgical resection. Most of \nthe data regarding the role of surgery in SCLC are from retrospective \nstudies .85-90 These studies report favorable 5 -year survival rates of 40% to \n60% in patients with stage I disease. In most series, survival rates decline \nsignificantly in patients with advanced disease  with lymph node \ninvolvement . Therefore , the general recommendation for surgery is \nrestricted to certain patients with stage I –IIA disease (T1 –2, N0, M0). \nFewer  than 5% of patients with SCLC have true stage I –IIA disease.91 \nAnalyses of the SEER database suggest that surgery is appropriate for \nsome patients with localized disease.15,92 However, retrospective  studies \nand analyses of the SEER database are limited by the lack of information \non chemotherapy. In addition, comparison of the survival of surgical \npatients to those who did not undergo surgery is inherently flawed by \nselection bias. Ultimately, the role of surgery in SCLC will not be fully \ndelineated  until prospective trials in patients who are rigorously staged \ncompare surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy versus  concurrent \nchemoradiotherapy.  \nThe Lung Cancer Study Group conducted the only prospective \nrandomized trial evaluating the role of surgery in SCLC.93 Patients with \nlimited -stage SCLC , excluding those with solitary peripheral nodules, that \nresponded to 5 cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, and vincristine  (CAV) were randomly assigned to undergo \nthoracic RT with or without resection. The overall survival rates of patients on the two arms were equivalent, suggesting no benefit to surgery in this \nsetting. However, only 19% of enrolled patients had clinical limited stage I \n(T1–2, N0, M0) disease. Data show that patients with SCLC who have \nnodal disease (i .e., T1–3, N1–3, M0–1) do not benefit from surgery.93  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends that in  patients who do not smoke tobacco, \nsmall lesions —that are presumed to be small cell carcinoma on biopsy —\nshould be resected because they are likely carcinoids that have been \nmisdiagnosed (see the  NCCN Guidelines for Neuroendocrine and Adrenal \nTumors, available at www.NCCN.org ). The NCCN SCLC Panel also \nrecommends surgery for certain  patients with clinical stage I –IIA (T1–2, \nN0) SCLC with negative mediastinal lymph nodes that have been \nconfirmed by  mediastinal staging.13,85,94 Surgery can include patients with \nclinical limited stage IIA SCLC based on the staging criteria that includes \ntumors up to 5 cm in diameter (T2b) without lymph node involvement (N0). \nThe NCCN Panel added recommendations for patients who did not have a \npreoperative biopsy  but have an intraoperative diagnosis of likely SCLC . If \nresection is performed, the NCCN SCLC Panel recommends lobectomy \n(preferred) with mediastinal lymph node dissection or systematic lymph \nnode  sampling  (e.g., >3 N2 and >1 N1 stations) . The Panel does not \nrecommend pneumonectomy  if nodal metastatic disease needs to be \nencompassed  or under other circumstances . Chemoradiation is the \npreferred alternative over any resection requiring pneumonectomy.  \nFollowing surgery , adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation  is \nrecommended  based on the  absence or  presence of nodal metastases  for \npatients with limited stage I –IIA (T1 –2, N0) SCLC with negative margins  \n(R0 resection ).88,95 -97 Adjuvant chemotherapy alone is recommended for \npatients without nodal metastases  (N0). Concurrent or sequential \nchemotherapy and postoperative mediastinal RT are recommended for \npatients with N+ disease .98 Although Panel members agree that \npostoperative mediastinal RT is recommended for nodal metastases , it PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nSmall Cell Lung Cancer   \n \nMS-8 should be based on the extent of nodal sampling/dissection and extent of \nnodal positivity  The benefit  of PCI is unclear in patients with pathologic \nstage I (T1–2a, N0, M0) who have had definitive therapy .99,100 For patients \nwith limited stage I –IIA (T1 –2, N0) SCLC with positive margins (R1/R2  \nresection ), the Panel recommends  concurrent chemoradiation  following \nsurgery . The NCCN SCLC Panel recommends response assessment \nfollowing a djuvant therapy to establish new disease baseline.  \nSystemic Therapy  \nFor all patients with SCLC, systemic therapy  is an essential component of \nappropriate treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy  is recommended for \npatients  with early -stage SCLC who have had surgery or SABR . For \npatients with  limited -stage SCLC who are not eligible for surgery or SABR  \nor have positive mediastinal staging , chemotherapy  with concurrent \nthoracic RT (category 1  for patients with PS 0 –2) is the recommended \nprimary treatment .9,101,102 For patients with extensive -stage SCLC , \nsystemic therapy alone is recommended . RT may be used in select \npatients with extensive -stage disease for palliation of symptoms (see \nNCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care, available at www. NCCN .org). These \noptions are rationalized based on studies described  in the following \nsections . \nCisplatin Versus Carboplatin  \nRandomized trials in a small number of patients with SCLC and \nretrospective analysis of patients with extensive -stage SCLC  suggest \nsimilar efficacy between  cisplatin and carboplatin regimens.103-105 In a \nmeta -analysis of  663 patients with limited -stage SCLC (32%)  and \nextensive -stage SCLC (68%) , no significant difference was observed in \nresponse rate (67% vs. 66%), progression -free survival (PFS) (5.5 vs. 5.3 \nmonths), or overall survival (9.6 vs. 9.4 months) between cisplatin - versus  \ncarboplatin -containing regimens .106 Carboplatin is frequently substituted \nfor cisplatin  to reduce the risk of emesis, neuropathy, and nephropathy.107 However, the use of carboplatin carries a greater risk of \nmyelosuppression.107  \nLimited -Stage SCLC  \nAdjuvant chemotherapy  alone is  recommended for patients  who have \nundergone surgical resection (N0) or SABR for early -stage SCLC . \nHowever, m ost patients with limited -stage SCLC  are not eligible for \nsurgery or SABR. Etoposide plus cisplatin is the most commonly used \nfirst-line combination chemotherapy regimen for patients with \nlimited -stage SCLC.108,109 Etoposide  plus cisplatin replaced alkylator  plus \nanthracycline -based regimens based on its superiority in both efficacy \nand toxicity.110-112 If pathologic lymph node involvement is found at \nsurgery (N1 or N2)  for patients with stage I –IIA (T1 –2, N0, M0), then \nthoracic RT can be added concurrently or sequentially to \netoposide/cisplatin.  Treatment with etoposide/cisplatin plus definitive \nthoracic RT showed  response rates of 70% to 90% with a median overall \nsurvival of 2 5 to 30 months and 5 -year overall survival rates of 3 1% to \n34%.108 Thoracic RT improves local control rates by 25% in patients with \nlimited -stage SCLC  and is associated with improved surviva l.101,102 Data \nsuggest that chemoradiotherapy may also be indicated for patients with \nlimited -stage SCLC  who have cytologically negative or indeterminate \npleural effusions but not for those with pericardial effusions.113,114 \nEtoposide/cisplatin in combination with thoracic RT increases the  risk of \nesophagitis, pulmonary , and hematologic toxicity.115  \nFor patients with limited -stage IIB –IIIC (T3 –4, N0, M0; T1 –4, N1–3, M0) \nSCLC , the NCCN Guidelines recommend s different  etoposide/cisplatin \nregimens plus concurrent thoracic RT (category 1).101,102,116,117 The \npreferred etoposide/cisplatin regimens for limited -stage SCLC are based \non the dosing used in the CONVERT trial.108 Other recommended \noption s for limited -stage SCLC  include carboplatin/etoposide and other  \ncisplatin/etoposide doses .

Durvalumab may be continued until disease progression or \nintolerable toxicity, or for a maximum of 24 months. Additionally, the \nPanel recommends if PCI is being considered in this setting it should be \ngiven prior to consolid ation durvalumab.   \nExtensive -Stage SCLC  \nThe NCCN SCLC Panel recommends certain combination chemotherapy \nplus immunotherapy regimen s as preferred option s for patients with extensive -stage SCLC.120-122 In patients with extensive -stage SCLC  and \nbrain metastases, systemic therapy can be given either before or after \nbrain  RT depending on whether the patient has neurologic symptoms.16,123 \nThe Panel recommends steroid initiation for patients with spinal cord \ncompression or brain met astasis who have symptomatic neurologic \ndisease.  For example : dexamethasone 10  mg loading dose followed by 4  \nto 6 mg maintenance dose (IV or PO every 4 –6 hours [or as appropriate ]) \ncan be initiated .124 If system ic therapy is given first, brain RT is \nadministered after completion of systemic therapy.  However, if brain \nmetastases progress while on systemic therapy, it is recommended that \nbrain RT is initiated before completion of systemic therapy. Systemic \ntherapy with or without RT to localized symptomatic sites is recommended \nfor patients with extensive disease , which includes the superior vena cava \n(SVC), lobar obstruction, and bone met astasis. Prophylactic  external \nbeam RT (EBRT) can be considered  for patients with high fracture risk  \ndue to osseous structural impairment . \nDuring systemic therapy for patients with extensive -stage SCLC , the Panel \nrecommends  response assessment using CT with contrast of the \nchest/abdomen/pelvis after every 2 to 3  cycles of systemic  therapy. Serial \nbrain imaging is also recommended for patients with extensive -stage \nSCLC  who have asymptomatic brain metastases and receiv e systemic \ntherapy before brain RT . Brain MRI (preferred) or CT with contrast is \nrecommended to be repeated after every 2 cycles of systemic therapy until \nbrain RT is initiated or systemic therapy is completed, whichever is first.  \nFor many years, platinum plus etoposide had been the only recommended \ntherapy for patients with extensive -stage SCLC; however, the preferred \nregimens now include the programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1)–targeted \nimmune checkpoint inhibitor s, atezolizumab  or durvalumab . \nContraindications for treatment with programmed cell death protein 1 \n(PD-1)/PD -L1 inhibitors may include active or previously documented PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

The Panel recommends continuation of maintenance \nimmunotherapy until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. \nAtezolizumab or durvalumab may cause unique immune -mediated \nadverse events that are not seen with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy . \nTherefore, health care providers should be aware of the spectrum and \nmanagement of potential immune -mediated adverse events and have a \ndiscussion with patients about possible side effects (see t he NCCN \nGuidelines for Management of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities, \navailable at www.N CCN .org). High-dose corticosteroids are generally \nrecommended for immune -mediated adverse events based on the severity \nof the reaction. Atezolizumab or durvalumab should be withheld or \ndiscontinued for severe or life -threatening immune -mediated adverse \nevents when indicated (see prescribing information)  \nAtezolizumab Plus Chemotherapy  \nIMpower133 , a phase 3 randomized trial , assessed the  addition of \natezolizumab  (treatment and maintenance)  to carboplatin plus etoposide  \nin 403 patients with previously untreated extensive -stage SCLC  and \ncompar ed outcome s to carboplatin plus etoposide alone .122 The 1-year \noverall survival rate was 51.9% for the atezolizumab regimen versus  \n39.0% for chemotherapy alone. The median overall survival was 12.3 \nmonths ( 95% CI, 10.8 –15.8) with the addition of atezolizumab  versus  10.3 \nmonths (95% CI, 9.3 –11.3)  with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio [HR], \n0.76; 95% CI, 0.6 –0.95; P = .0154) .120 Response rates were similar in both \narms (60% with chemotherapy plus atezolizumab vs . 64% with \nchemotherapy alone) . The rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was similar \nin both groups ( 67.7% for the atezolizumab regimen vs. 63.3% for \nchemotherapy alone ). There were 4 deaths (2%) in the atezolizumab \ngroup versus  11 deaths (5.6%)  in the chemotherapy alone group. Different \ndoses for maintenance atezolizumab have been FDA -approved for \npatients with extensive -stage SCLC. In light of these data and FDA approval , the NCCN SCLC Panel recommends carboplatin plus etoposide \nplus atezolizumab as a category 1  and preferred first -line systemic therapy \noption followed by maintenance atezolizumab for patients with  \nextensive -stage SCLC.120,122 The NCCN Panel recommends either 1200 or \n1680 mg of maintenance atezolizumab.  The category 1 recommendation \nis only for 1200 mg of maintenance atezolizumab based on  the dose used \nin the clinical trial.120,122 Based on the FDA approval in 2024, the Panel \nindicates  that Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase -tqjs subcutaneous injection \nmay be substituted for IV atezolizumab. The Panel notes that \natezolizumab and hyaluronidase -tqjs has different dosing and  \nadministration instructions compared to IV atezolizumab  infusion . \nDurvalumab Plus Chemotherapy  \nCASPIAN, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed adding durvalumab to \netoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin followed by maintenance \ndurvalumab  in 537 patients with previously untreated extensive -stage \nSCLC  and compared response to platinum plus etoposide alon e \nregimens .121,125 Most patients received carboplatin (78%). A 3-year \nanalysis showed that the median overall survival was 13.0 months (95% \nCI, 11.5 –14.8) in the durvalumab plus chemotherapy group and 10.3 \nmonths (95% CI, 9.3 –11.2) in the chemotherapy alone group (HR, 0.73; \n95% CI, 0.59 –0.91; P = .0047).126 The 1-year overall survival rate was \n52.8% for the durvalumab regimen versus  39.3% for chemotherapy alone. \nThe rate of serious adverse events was similar in both groups  (32% vs. \n36%). The death rate from adverse events was also similar (2% vs. 1%).  \nIn this trial, adding tremelimumab to durvalumab/etoposide carboplatin (or \ncisplatin) did not improve overall survival  (OS)  compared with \nplatinum/etoposide (10.4 vs. 10.5 months; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 –1.0). \nBased on the data and FDA approval,  the NCCN SCLC Pan el \nrecommends durvalumab plus etoposide plus (carboplatin or cisplatin)  as \na category 1 and preferred first -line systemic therapy option followed by PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

Additional  chemotherapy combination  regimens  evaluated in \npatients with extensive -stage SCLC  show  inconsistent evidence of benefit \ncompared with  etoposide/cisplatin.  For example, the combination of \nirinotecan and cisplatin initially appeared to be better than \netoposide/cisplatin.  A phase 3 trial in Japan reported that patients with \nextensive -stage SCLC treated with irinotecan plus cisplatin had a median \nsurvival of 12.8 months compared with 9.4 months for patients treated with \netoposide/cisplatin (P = .002).128 The 2-year survival was 19.5% in the \nirinotecan plus cisplatin group versus  5.2% in the etoposide/cisplatin \ngroup.128 Two subsequent large phase 3 trials performed in the United \nStates comparing irinotecan plus cisplatin versus  etoposide/cisplatin \nshow ed no  significant difference in response rate or overall survival.129,130 \nA phase 3 randomized trial of 220 patients with extensive -stage SCLC \nfound that median overall survival slightly improved with irinotecan and \ncarboplatin compared with carboplatin and oral etoposide (8.5 vs. 7.1 \nmonths ; P = .04).131 In addition, a meta -analysis suggested an \nimprovement in PFS and overall survival with irinotecan plus platinum \nregimens compared with etoposide plus platinum regimens.132 The NCCN \nSCLC Panel recommends  the irinotecan -based regimens as primary \ntherapy options (useful in certain circumstances ) for patients with \nextensive -stage SCLC. However, the relatively small absolute survival \nbenefit needs to be balanced  against the toxicity profile of \nirinotecan -based regimens.  \nThe use of maintenance or consolidation chemotherapy beyond the \nrecommended 4 to 6  cycles results in a minor increase in the  duration of response  without improving survival and carries a greater risk of \ncumulative toxicity.133,134 The inability to destroy residual cells, despite the \ninitial chemosensitivity of SCLC, suggests the existence of cancer stem \ncells that are relatively resistant to cytotoxic therapy.  Alternating or \nsequential combination therapies have been designed to overcome drug \nresistance by expos ing the tumor to as many active cytotoxic agents as \npossible during initial treatment.135 However, this approach has not \nimproved PFS or overall survival in randomized trials .136,137 Therefore, the  \nNCCN SCLC Panel  recommends 4 cycles of systemic cytotoxic therapy \nfor patients with limited -stage  (with concurrent radiation)  and extensive -\nstage (with concurrent immunotherapy) SCLC . However, some patients \nwith extensive -stage SCLC  may receive up to 6 cycles based on response \nand tolerability.   \nAttempts to improve long -term survival rates in patients with SCLC \nthrough the addition of more agents or the use of dose -intense \nchemotherapy, maintenance therapy, or alternating non -cross -resistant \nchemotherapy regimens hav e not shown significant advantages compared \nto recommended approaches.  In two trials, the addition of ifosfamide (or \ncyclophosphamide plus an anthracycline) to etoposide/cisplatin showed a \nmodest survival advantage.138,139 However, these findings have not been \nuniformly observed, and the addition of an alkylating agent, with or without \nan anthracycline, significantly increases hematologic toxicity when \ncompared to etoposide/cisplatin alone.140 Two different phase 3 trials  \nassess ing the combination of ifosfamide, etoposide, and epirubicin versus \netoposide/cisplatin , and carboplatin plus etoposide with or without \npalifosfamide  confirmed the lack of improvement in survival with \nthree -drug chemo therapy regimens in patients with extensive -stage \nSCLC .141,142 Similarly, the addition of paclitaxel to either cisplatin or \ncarboplatin plus etoposide yielded promising results in phase 2 studies , \nbut did not improve survival and was associated with unacceptable toxicity \nin a phase 3 trial.143  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nSmall Cell Lung Cancer   \n \nMS-12 The role of high  dose chemotherapy for patients with SCLC remains \ncontroversial. Patients receiving high chemotherapy doses compared with  \nthose given conventional doses of the same agents  had h igher complete \nand partial response rates, and modestly longer median survival times .144 \nHowever, randomized trials comparing conventional chemotherapy doses \nto incremental increas es in dose intensity (up to 2 times the conventional \ndose ) have not consistently shown an increase in response rate or \nsurvival.145-148 In addition, a meta -analysis  of trials that studied  \ndose -intense variations of the CAV and etoposide/cisplatin regimens found \nthat increased relative dose intensity resulted in only a small, clinically \ninsignificant enhancement of median survival in patients with \nextensive -stage SCLC .149 Early phase 2 results designed to increase dose \nintensity  by weekly cyclic multidrug chemotherapy were promising , but \nfavorable patient selection was of some concern.150,151 No survival benefits \nwere documented in randomized trials, and excessive treatment -related \nmortality w ere noted with weekly cyclic  multidrug chemotherapy \nregimens.152-155 \nDespite the recent success with atezolizumab /chemotherapy or \ndurvalumab/chemotherapy regimens , other immunotherapy -based \nstrategies have not been as favorable. A phase 3 rando mized trial in \npatients with extensive -stage SCLC  reported that the addition of \nipilimumab to etoposide with either cisplatin or carboplatin as first -line \ntherapy did not improve either overall survival or PFS compared with \nchemotherapy alone .156 Likewise, another phase 3 randomized trial \nshowed no improvement in overall survival in patients with extensive -stage \nSCLC  treated  with first-line pembrolizumab plus etoposide /platinum  \nfollowed by maintenance pembrolizumab  compared with chemotherapy \nalone.57  \nAntiangiogenic therapy ha s also  been evaluated in SCLC. In patients with \nlimited -stage SCLC, a phase 2 study of irinotecan, carboplatin, and bevacizumab with concurrent RT followed by maintenance bevacizumab \nwas terminated early because of an unacceptable incidence of \ntracheoesophageal fistulae. In extensive -stage SCLC, phase 2 trials of \nplatinum -based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab showed  promising \nresponse and survival data.157-160 However, at least two randomized trials \nhave demonstrated no survival benefit for the addition of bevacizumab to \nstandard chemotherapy.161,162 Currently, the NCCN SCLC Panel does not \nrecommend use of bevacizumab in patients with SCLC.  \nCytokines (e .g., GM -CSF, granulocyte colony -stimulating factor [ G-CSF]) \ncan ameliorate chemotherapy -induced myelosuppression and reduce the \nincidence of febrile neutropenia, but cumulative thrombocytopenia remains \ndose -limiting. Although trials involving patients with SCLC were \ninstrumental in obtaining FDA approval for the clinical use of cytokines,163 \nmaintenance of dose intensity with growth factors does not prolong \ndisease -free survival or overall survival.164,165 The Panel does not \nrecommend GM -CSF (category 1 for not using it) or G -CSF for patients \nwith limited -stage SCLC receiv ing systemic therapy /RT.118,166 Trilaciclib or \nG-CSF may be used as prophylactic supportive care  options to decrease \nthe incidence of chemotherapy -induced myelosuppression when \nadministering certain regimens for patients with extensive -stage \nSCLC.118,166 -171 It is important to note that  trilaciclib or G -CSF are not \ntreatment options.   \nTransformed SCLC from NSCLC with an Oncogenic Driver \nThe Panel recognizes that transformed SCL C from NSCLC is a rare \npopulation of patients with limited data including treatment options. The \nPanel recommends considering referral to a center with expertise in \nmanaging transformed SCLC  with an oncogenic driver . Oncogenic \ndrivers can be actionable genomic alterations. The Panel recommends \nsystemic cytotoxic chemotherapy using SCLC Guidelines  due to lack of \ndata for transformed SCLC .

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nSmall Cell Lung Cancer   \n \nMS-13 being used . Furthermore , for v1.202 5, the Panel clarified that in patients \nwho develop small cell lung cancer as a resistance mechanism to \ntyrosine kinase inhibitors used for actionable genomic alteration driven \nnon-small cell lung cancer, if tyrosine kinase inhibitors are continued, \nimmune ch eckpoint inhibitors (ICI) should be avoided, due to known \ntoxicity that is primarily driven by the long half -life of ICIs . \nOlder Patients  \nThe incidence of SCLC increases with age  with the median age at \ndiagnosis being  >70 years.172 The functional status of an individual patient \nis more useful than chronological age in guiding clinical decision -making  \nthat includ es consider ing treatment tolerance  (see the NCCN Guidelines \nfor Older Adul t Oncology , available at  www.NCCN.org ). Greater attention \nto the needs and support systems of a patient’s  functional status  is \nrecommended to provide optimal care.  Patients who are ab le to perform \nactivities of daily living (ADLs) should be treated with combination  \nsystemic therapy  and RT, if indicated.173-175 For example, a subgroup \nanalysis of the CONVERT trial suggests that concurrent chemoradiation \nyields equivalent median survival in patients <70 years  versus  patients \n>70 years and limited -stage SCLC (29 vs. 30 months; P = .38).173 \nHowever, myelosuppression, fatigue, and lower organ reserves are \nencountered more frequently in patients  >70 years . Therefore, the study \nrecommended closer surveillance for patients >70 years  during treatment \nto avoid excessive risk.173  \nRandomized trials have indicated that less -intens e treatment ( e.g., \nsingle -agent etoposide) is inferior to combination chemotherapy ( e.g., \nplatinum plus etoposide) in patients of all ages with good PS (0 –2).176,177 A \nretrospective analysis in 8637 patients  >70 years  with limited -stage SCLC  \nreported that chemoradiation increased survival compared with  \nchemotherapy alone.174 Several other strategies have been evaluated in \npatients >65 years with SCLC.105,178 -180 The use of 4 cycles of carboplatin \nplus etoposide seems to yield favorable results, because the area-under -the-curve (AUC) dosing of carboplatin takes into account the \ndeclining renal function of the patient.180 However, targeting carboplatin to \nan AUC of 5, rather than 6, is more reasonable in the population  >70 \nyears .181 A short  2-week  course, full -intensity chemotherapy showed  \nacceptable results  in patients  (median age , 73 and poor PS) ; but this \napproach has not been directly compared with 4 to 6 cycles of therapy.182  \nPCI should be used with caution in patients who are older . A Dutch \nanalysis of more than 5000 patients suggests that median survival is lower  \nin patients >70 years compared with  patients <70 years treated with PCI , \nregardless of stage.183 Patients aged ≥60 years are at increased risk for \ncognitive decline after PCI; therefore, the risks and benefits of PCI versus \nclose MRI surveillance need to be discussed.184-187  \nSurveillance  for Relapse  \nAlthough SCLC respon ds to initial treatment, disease relapse is observed \nin most patients .188,189 Therefore,  surveillance recommendations to assess \nfor relapse in patients with SCLC are outlined in the algorithm. Most \nNCCN Member Institutions use chest CT ( ± abdomen/pelvis) every 2 to 6 \nmonths (more frequently in years 1 to 2 and less frequently thereafter). \nThe frequency of surveillance decreases during subsequent years \nbecause of the declining risk of recurrence.190 If a new pulmonary nodule \ndevelops, it should prompt evaluation for a new primary lung cancer, \nbecause second primary tumors post-treatment  frequent ly occur in \npatients with no evidence  of SCLC.191,192 It is important to monitor for brain \nmetastases , which allows for early treatment , prior to  the development of \npotentially debilitating neurologic symptoms . The NCCN SCLC Panel \nrecommends brain MRI (preferred) or CT with contrast every 3 to 4 \nmonths during year 1 for all patients and then every 6 months as clinically \nindicated , regardless of the PCI status. MRI is more sensitive than CT for \nidentifying brain metastases .75 The Panel maintain s that FDG -PET/CT is \nnot recommended for routine follow -up unless contrast CT \nchest/abdomen/pelvis is contraindicated .

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nSmall Cell Lung Cancer   \n \nMS-14 intervention is recommended for all patients with SCLC, because second \nprimary tumors occur less commonly in patients who quit smoking (see the \nNCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation , available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).193-195 Patients who previously smoked tobacco  should be \nencouraged to remain abstinent.  The NCCN SCLC Panel also \nrecommends the survivorship guidelines for appropriate patients (see the \nNCCN Guidelines for Survivorship, available at www.NCCN.org ).  \nSubsequent Systemic Therapy  \nPatients with disease relapse or with primary progressive disease may be \ntreated with subsequent systemic therapy.  Recommended subsequent \nsystemic therapy options  are based on chemotherapy -free interval (CTFI) \nof 1) 6 months or less; or 2) more than 6 months. Clinical trial enrollment is \nthe preferred regimen for both CTFI >6 months and CTFI <6 months. The \nPanel recommends considering genomic profiling of relapsed tumors, if \nnot previously performed, to determine clinical trial eligibility.  Subsequent \nsystemic therapy provides significant palliation in many patients, although \nthe likelihood of response is highly  dependent on the time from initial \ntherapy to relapse.196 If the interval is 6 months or less (refractory or \nresistant disease), response to most agents or regimens is poor (≤10%). If \nmore than 6 months have elapsed (sensitive disease), expected response \nrates are approximately 25%. Response rates are higher with newer \nagents, such as lurbinectedin . Unfortunately, m ost patients relapse in 6 \nmonths or less.197,198 Note that the European Society for Medical Oncology \n(ESMO) Guidelin es use cutoffs of 3 months or more for sensitive SCLC \nand less than 3 months for resistant SCLC.199 The NCCN SCLC Panel \nrecommends additional subsequent therapy options for patients with \nSCLC based on clinical expertise and trial data.  Other recommended \nsubsequent therapy options , described in the following sections,  include \ntopotecan (oral [PO] or IV), lurbinectedin, CAV, docetaxel, oral etoposide, \ngemcitabine, irinotecan, nivolumab, paclitaxel, pembrolizumab, and \ntemozolomide (category 2A for all agents).  The optimal duration of subsequent systemic therapy has not been fully explored. For cytotoxic \nchemother apy agents, the duration of treatment is usually short, and the \ncumulative toxicity is frequently limiting even in patients who experience \nresponse. For these reasons, subsequent systemic therapy should be \ncontinued until progression of disease or developm ent of unacceptable \ntoxicity. The Panel recommends r esponse assessment using CT with \ncontrast of the chest/abdomen/pelvis  after every 2 to 3 cycles. Dose \nreduction or growth factor support should be considered for patients with a \nPS of 2.  For CNS progressi on only, the Panel recommends continuing  \nsystemic therapy and treat brain metastases with RT. Additional \nsubsequent systemic therapy ( e.g., third line) can be considered if patients \nare still PS 0 to 2 .  \nPlatinum -Based Therapy  \nA phase 3 randomized trial assessed carboplatin plus etoposide compared \nwith oral topotecan in 162 patients with SCLC relapse after more than 3 \nmonths on first-line platinum/etoposide therapy.200 The median PFS was \n4.7 months (90% CI, 3.9 –5.5) in the carboplatin/etoposide  group versus  \n2.7 months (90% CI, 2.3 –3.2) in the oral topotecan group (HR, 0.57; 90% \nCI, 0.41 –0.73; P = .004). Grade 3 –4 adverse events included \nthrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, and asthenia. \nIn the topotecan group, two treatment -related deaths occurred; no deaths \noccurred in the carboplatin/etoposide  group. The NCCN SCLC Panel \nrecommends subsequent therapy with platinum -based regimens based on \nthe clinical trial data.197,200 -203 The NCCN Panel  maintains that \nrechallenging with the original regimen, or similar platinum -based regimen, \nis recommended for subsequent systemic therapy , if CTFI > 6 months and \nmay be considered if there has been a CTFI  of at least  3 to 6 \nmonths.197,200 -203 The NCCN Panel maintain s that platinum -based doublet s \nare the preferred subsequent therapy  option s for patients with SCLC and a \nPS of 0 to 2.197,200,201 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

The response rate was 22% (95% CI, 11.2% –\n37.1%) if CTFI was less than 3 months . The response rate was 45% (95% \nCI, 32.1% –58.4%) if CTFI  was 3 months  or more. Common grade 3 –4 \nadverse events included anemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, and \nthrombocytopenia. There were no reported treatment -related deaths.  In a \nsubset analysis of th is trial, lurbinectedin was assessed as second -line \ntherapy in 20 patients with SCLC who had received plat inum/etoposide \nmore than 6 months ago.198 The overall response rate with lurbinectedin \nwas 60% (95% CI, 36.1% –86.9%). The median overall survival was 16.2 \nmonths (95% CI, 9.6 –upper level not reached). After 1 year, 60.9% of \npatients were alive  and after 2 years, 27.1% were alive. Common grade \n3–4 adverse events included neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nfatigue, and increased liver function tests.

The median overall \nsurvival was  8.6 months (95%  CI, 7.1 –9.4) with lurbinectedin/doxorubicin \nversus  7.6 months (95% CI, 6.6–8.2) with CAV or topotecan (HR, 0.97; \n95% CI, 0.82 –1.15). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 66% of \npatients receiving lurbinectedin/doxorubicin versus  86.5% of patients in \nthe control group . Grade 3 or worse adverse events included neutropenia \n(lurbinectedin/doxorubicin: 37%; control: 69%). Two patients  (<1%)  died \nbecause of treatment -related adverse events in  the lurbinectedin/doxorubicin group and 10 (3%)  patients died in  the control \ngroup . The dose of lurbinectedin was 2 mg/m2 in the ATLANTIS trial, which \nis less than the dose  used in the phase 2 trial discussed earlier.198,204  \nThe NCCN SCLC Panel recommends lurbinectedin as a subsequent \ntherapy option  for patients with SCLC with CTFI >6 months (other \nrecommended regimens)  and CTFI <6 months  (preferred) .198,204 The \nNCCN Panel decided to recommend lurbinectedin at the higher dose  \nbased on the FDA approval and since the lower dose of lurbinectedin did \nnot perform well in ATLANTIS .204,205  \nTopotecan  \nTopotecan is also recommended as a subsequent therapy option  based \non clinical trial data.200 A randomized phase 3 trial  for subsequent \ntreatment  for patients with SCLC relapse at least 60 days after therapy  \ncompared single -agent IV topotecan with the combination regimen CAV.206 \nBoth arms had similar response rates (topotecan , 24.3%; CAV , 18.3%) \nand survival (25 .0 vs. 24.7  weeks) . Compared to CAV, t opotecan caused \nless grade 4 neutropenia (37.8% vs. 51.4%; P < .001)  and improved \nsymptoms of dyspnea, anorexia, hoarseness, and fatigue. There is  \nconflicting data regarding the usefulness of weekly topotecan in patients \nwith relapsed SCLC.207,208 Many practicing oncologists have noted \nexcessive toxicity when using 1.5 mg/m2 of IV topotecan for 5 days, and \nstudies suggest that an attenuated dose may be equally efficacious with \nlower toxicity.209 In another phase 3 trial, oral topotecan improved overall \nsurvival compared with  best supportive care (26 vs. 14 weeks).210 The \nefficacy and toxicity  of oral and IV topotecan  seem to be similar and \ntherefore either route may be used .210,211 The NCCN SCLC Panel \nrecommends oral or IV topotecan as a subsequent therapy option for \npatients with SCLC with CTFI >6 months (other recommended regimens) \nand CTFI <6 months (preferred) .200,205,206,210,212  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

The Panel added a consideration for irinotecan for \npatients with CNS disease.  \nTarlatamab -dlle  \nA phase 1 trial in patients heavily pretreated for relapsed/refractory SCLC \nshowed promising durability and acceptable safety profile  with tarlatamab, \na bispecific T -cell engager antibody that  target s delta -like ligand 3 (DLL -3) \nand CD3 .215 DLL3  is abnormally expressed on the surface of the majority \nof SCLC cells (85 -94%) and inhibits Notch A phase 2 trial evaluated the \nactivity and safety of two doses (10  mg and 100  mg) of IV tarlatamab -dlle \nin patients with SCLC that had relapsed or was refractory to one platinum -\nbased treatment and at least one other regimen  (n = 176).216 The median \nPFS in patients who received 10  mg of was 4.9 months compared to 3.9 \nmonths in patients who received 100 mg of tarlatamab -dlle. Although the \noverall survival data have not matured, the percentage of patients alive at \nlast follow -up (~10 months in both groups) was 57% and 51% in patients \nwho received 10 mg and 100 mg, respectively.  Because of the favorable \nbenefit to risk ratio in patients who received 10 mg versus 100 mg, the \nlower dose has been chosen for subsequent studies. Based on this trial, \nthe Panel recommends tarlatamab -dlle (10 mg dosing schedule)  as a \ncategory 2A, subsequent therapy option for patients with CTFI >6 months \n(other recommended regimens ) and CTFI <6 months ( preferred \nregimens).  Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab  \nICIs have been evaluated in patients with relapsed SCLC.217-220 \nCheckMate 032 , a phase 1/2 trial , assessed nivolumab alone (n = 147) or \nvarious doses of nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n = 96) for relapsed \nSCLC.217,218 Response rates were 11.6% for nivolumab  and 21.9% for \nnivolumab plus ipilimumab.217 The 12 - and 24 -month overall survival rates \nwere similar (nivolumab, 30.5% and 17.9%; nivolumab plus ipilimumab , \n30.2% and 16.9%, respectively). Grade 3 –4 adverse events were 12.9% \nfor nivolumab alone and 37.5% for nivolumab plus ipilimumab . In patients \nreceiving nivolumab alone, t he most common grade 3 or 4 \ntreatment -related adverse event s were pneumonitis and increased levels \nof lipase and aspartate aminotransferase .  \nCheckMate 331 , a randomized phase 3 trial , assessed nivolumab \nmonotherapy versus  topotecan or amrubicin in 569 patients with relapsed \nSCLC.212,221 Data show that overall survival was 7.5 months in patients \nreceiving nivolumab versus  8.4 months  in those receiving chemotherapy  \n(HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72 –1.04; P = .11).212 Overall survival was similar \nregardless of PD -L1 levels. Response rates were 13.7% for nivolumab \ncompared with 16.5% for chemotherapy. Treatment -related deaths \noccurred in two patients receiving nivolumab and in three  patients \nreceiving chemotherapy. Fewer grade 3 –4 adverse events occurred in \npatients receiving nivolumab compared with chemotherapy (14% vs. 73%, \nrespectively). A study reported that third -line therapy with nivolumab was \nassociated with longer survival (5.7 months; 95% CI, 3.5 –8.0) compared \nwith other treatments such as paclitaxel or topotecan (3.8 months; 95% CI, \n2.8–4.9; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.44 –0.90).222 The 1 -year overall survival rate \nis 28% with nivolumab versus  4% with the other treatments.  \nA combined analysis of two trials , phase Ib (KEYNOTE -028) and phase 2 \n(KEYNOTE -158), evaluated the activity of pembrolizumab in 83 patients \nwith relapsed SCLC who had received two or more lines of therapy . 56% \nof patients were positive for PD -L1 (≥1%)  and 84% patients did not have PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

The median overall survival was 7.7 months \n(95% CI, 5.2 –10.1); the estimated 12 -month overall survival rate was 34%. \nBoth overall survival and response rate were higher in those who were \nPD-L1 positive; however, one patient with a complete response had a \ntumor that was PD -L1 negative. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in \n9.6% (8/83) of patients; two patients died from treatment -related adverse \nevents (pneumonitis and encephalitis).  \nThe FDA has withdrawn the subsequent therapy indications for nivolumab \nor pembrolizumab for patients with relapsed SCLC, because phase 3 \nrandomized trial data did not show an improvement in overall \nsurvival.212,218,219,221,223 -226 However, the NCCN SCLC Panel lists these \nagents  as subsequent systemic therapy option s (other recommended \nregimens) for patients with CTFI <6 months . The Panel decided tha t \nnivolumab or pembrolizumab  are just as effective as  (sometimes better \nthan) and less toxic than  the other subsequent therapy options.212,222 In \naddition, many agents recommended as subsequent therapy options for \npatients with SCLC do not have an FDA indication in this setting but data \nshow that they are effective. Patients with limited -stage SCLC who relapse \nand have not previously received im mune checkpoint inhibitors may \nbenefit from subsequent therapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. \nFollowing the FDA approval, n ivolumab and hyaluronidase -nvhy \nsubcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV  nivolumab. Nivolumab \nand hyaluronidase -nvhy has a different dosing and administration  \ninstructions compared to IV nivolumab.  Howev er, the use of nivolumab  \nand pembrolizumab is discouraged in patients  whose disease progresses \nwhile on maintenance atezolizumab or durvalumab as part of first -line \ntherapy.  There are no data to suggest that giving patients subsequent \nimmune checkpoint inhibitors is effective if their disease previously  \nprogressed on other immune checkpoint inhibitors.   Health care providers should be aware of the spectrum of potential \nimmune -mediated adverse events  unique to immunotherapeutic agents, \nsuch as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, know how to manage these \nevents, and discuss  possible side effects  with patients  (see the NCCN \nGuidelines for Management of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities, \navailable at www.N CCN .org).227,228 For patients with immune -mediated \nadverse events, high-dose corticosteroids  are generally recommended \nbased on the severity of the reaction. Nivolumab or pembrolizumab should \nbe withheld or discontinued for severe or life -threatening \nimmune -mediated adverse events when indicated (see prescribing \ninformation).   \nOther Subsequent Therapy Options  \nPaclitaxel and docetaxel that belong to the taxane class of drugs have \nbeen assessed in patients with refractory or relapsed SCLC. In a phase 2 \nstudy in patients with refractory or relapsed SCLC; 24% of patients \nresponded to paclitaxel .229 Grade 3 –4 toxicity included neutropenia, \ninfection, rash, neuropathy, and pulmonary toxicity. Another phase 2 study \nof paclitaxel in patients with refractory SCLC yielded a response rate of \n29% (95% CI, 12% –51%).230 A retrospective study in 185 patients showed \na response rate of 17% during third-line or fourth -line therapy with \npaclitaxel.

The overall \nobjective response rate was 11.9%. One patient with refractory SCLC  and \nfour patients with sensitive SCLC responded. Grade 3 –4 toxicities \nincluded neutropenia (27%), thrombocytopenia (27%), neurologic toxicity \n(14%), and pulmonary (9%). Another phase 2 trial assessed  gemcitabine  \nin 38 patients with resistant SCLC that progressed within 3 months of last \ntherapy.236 The median survival was 17 weeks (range, 4 –84). The \nresponse rate was 13% (95% CI, 6% –27%) ; there were five partial \nresponses and no complete responses . Grade 3 toxicities included \nthrombocytopenia (29%) and leukopenia (18%).  \nData suggest that temozolomide may be useful for patients with SCLC, \nespecially those with brain metastases and methylated \nO6-methylguanine -DNA  methyltransferase (MGMT).237-239 Temozolomide \nwas assessed in a phase 2 trial  in patients with relapsed or refractory \nSCLC. In patients with sensitive SCLC, the overall response rate was 23% \n(95% CI, 12% –37%). The response rate improved for patients with \nmethylated MGMT compared to those with unmethylated MGMT (38% vs. \n7%; P = .08).  \nA phase 3 trial (JCOG0605) from Japan in patients with sensitive , \nrelapsed SCLC r eported that the combination  of cisplatin, etoposide, and \nirinotecan improved survival compared with  topotecan  (median survival, \n18.2 vs. 12.5 months; HR, 0.67; 90% CI, 0.51 –0.88; P = .0079). However, \nthe toxicity of this regimen  was significant and it is not recommended for \nsubsequent therapy.240 The NCCN Panel recommends CAV as a \nsubsequent therapy option s based on clinical trial data.206 Radi ation T herapy  \nRT is not recommended as primary treatment for patients with \nextensive -stage SCLC, however consolidative or  palliative RT  is an option  \nfor these patients . The American Radium Society appropriate use criteria \nand the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines are \nuseful resources.241-244 The Principles of Radiation Therapy  section in the \nNSCLC  algorithm may also be useful (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer,  available at www. NCCN .org).  \nThoracic Radiation Therapy  \nAchieving long -term local control using conventional chemoradiotherapy \nfor patients with limited -stage SCLC remains a challenge.  The addition of \nthoracic RT has improved survival for patients with limited -stage SCLC . \nMeta-analyses that include more than 2000 patients show that thoracic \nradiation for limited -stage SCLC  yields a 25% to 30% reduction in local \nprogression , and a corresponding 5% to 7% improvement in 2 -year overall \nsurvival compared with  chemotherapy alone.101,102 A phase 3 trial has  \nreported 5 -year overall survival of more than 30% , which is close to  \noutcomes of locally advanced NSCLC of similar stage.108  \nTiming of Radiation  with Chemotherapy  \nOptimal  thoracic RT is impacted by  several factors, including the timing of \nchemotherapy and RT (concurrent vs. sequential), timing of RT (early vs. \nlate), the RT target volume (original tumor volume vs. shrinking field as the \ntumor responds), dose of radiation, and fractionation of RT. Early \nconcurrent chemoradiotherapy is recommended for patients with \nlimited -stage SC LC based on randomized trials. A randomized phase 3 \ntrial by the Japanese Cooperative Oncology Group (9104) assessed \nsequential versus concu rrent thoracic RT combined with \netoposide/cisplatin for 231 patients with limited -stage SCLC .

Severe esophagitis occurred in 9% of patients \nreceiving concurrent chemoradiation and 4% receiving sequential \nchemoradiation.   \nSeveral systematic reviews and meta -analyses on the timing of thoracic \nRT in limited -stage SCLC have reported that early concurrent \nchemoradiation  results in a small, but significant improvement in overall \nsurvival compared with  late concurrent or sequential chemoradiation .245,246 \nA randomized phase 3 trial (by the National Cancer Institute of Canada) \ncompar ed RT beginning with either cycle 2 or cycle 6 of chemotherapy  \nand showed that early RT was associated with improved local and \nsystemic control and longer survival.247 Another meta -analysis in patients \nwith limited -stage SCLC showed that survival improved with rapid \ncompletion of the chemoradiotherapy regimen (start of any chemotherapy \nuntil the end of RT [SER]).248 A meta -analysis of individual patient data \nfrom 12 trials (2668 patients) report ed that early concurrent \nchemoradiation , associated with increase in acute esophagitis,  had higher \n5-year overall survival (HR, 0.79;  95% CI , 0.69–0.91)  compared with late \nconcurrent chemoradiation .249  \nRadiation Fractionation  \nThe Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG )/Radiation Therapy \nOncology Group  (RTOG)  compared accelerated to conventionally \nfractionated  RT with etoposide/cisplatin.250 In this trial, 412 patients with \nlimited -stage SCLC were treated with concurrent chemoradiation  using a \ntotal dose of 45 Gy delivered either twice daily over 3 weeks  (accelerated)  \nor once daily  over 5 weeks  (conventional) . Median overall survival was 23 \nversus  19 months ( P = .04), and 5 -year survival rates were 26% versus  \n16% in the accelerated  and conventional  RT arms, respectively.250 A \nhigher incidence of grade 3 –4 esophagitis was seen with the accelerated \nregimen compared with  the conventional  regimen.250 A significant criticism \nof this trial  is that the 45 Gy conventional  regimen provid ed suboptimal dose intensity compared to modern conventionally fractionated regimens \nusing higher total doses .  \nCONVERT , a phase 3  randomized trial , compared  accelerated  45 Gy \n(given twice daily over 3 weeks ) with higher dose  conventionally \nfractionated  66 Gy (given once daily over 6.5 weeks ) in 547 patients with \nlimited -stage SCLC.108 Median overall survival was similar between the 2 \ngroups  (30 vs. 25 months). However, the CONVERT trial was not powered \nto show equivalence. Although toxicity was generally similar between the \narms, patient s receiving accelerated 45 Gy had more grade 4 neutropenia \ncompared with those receiving conventional 66 Gy (49% vs. 38%; P = \n.05).  \nCALGB 30610 (Alliance) /RTOG 0538 , a randomized phase 3 trial , \ncompared high-dose conventional 70 Gy (once daily over 7 weeks ) with \naccelerated 45 Gy (twice daily over 3 weeks ) in 638 patients with \nlimited -stage SCLC.251 Originally, there was a 61.2 Gy concomitant boost  \ngroup  in this trial, but it was removed based on a planned interim toxicity \nanalysis.252 Median overall survival was 30.5 months in the conventional  \n70 Gy  arm versus  28.5 months in the accelerated 45 Gy  arm (HR, 0.94 ; \n95% CI , 0.75 –1.17; P = .591). There w ere 5 deaths in the conventional 70 \nGy arm and 2 deaths in the accelerated 45 Gy  arm. Overall survival and \ntoxicity were similar.

One trial in 182 patients with limited -stage \nSCLC  compared concurrent chemoradiation with high-dose accelerated \n65 Gy given as once -daily fractions over approximately 5 weeks with \nstandard -dose accelerated 45 Gy given as twice -daily fractions over 3 \nweeks .255 Estimated PFS was 17.2 months in the high -dose group versus  \n13.4 months in the standard -dose group ( P = .031). Overall survival was \n39.3 months in the high -dose group versus  33.6 months in the \nstandard -dose group ( P = .137). Grade 3 or higher esophagitis (high -dose , \n17.4% vs. standard -dose , 15.3%), grade 3 or higher pneumonitis \n(high -dose , 3.3% vs. standard -dose , 2.4%), and treatment -related deaths \n(high -dose , 2.2% vs. standard -dose , 1.2%)  were similar in each group. \nThe second trial in 176 patients with l imited -stage SCLC  compared  \nconcurrent chemoradiation using high -dose accelerated RT with 60 Gy \ngiven as twice -daily fraction s over 4 weeks  with accelerated \nstandard -dose 45 Gy given as twice -daily fraction s over 3 weeks .256 After \n2 years, 74.2% (95% CI, 63.8% –82.9%) of patients were alive in the 60 Gy \ngroup versus  48.1% ( 95% CI, 36.9% –59.5%) in the 45 Gy group. Three \ntreatment -related deaths occurred in each group.   \nDespite multiple trials , the optimal dose and fractionation of thoracic RT for \nSCLC remain s unresolved. Higher dose accelerated RT may be \nadvantageous, and this remains to be confirmed in larger studies. Two \nrandomized trials have not shown superior ity of  high dose without \nacceleration  (66 Gy or 70 Gy  over 6.5 –7 weeks ) over moderate dose \naccelerated fractionation (45 Gy  over 3 weeks ); however, survival and \ntoxicity are similar .108,251,257 Overall, accelerated RT (whether given once or twice daily) is superior to similar doses of conventionally fractionated RT \nand comparable to higher dose conventionally fractionated RT. The NCCN \nSCLC Panel recommends that either accelerated 45 Gy given as \ntwice -daily fractions over 3 weeks (category 1) or conventionally \nfractionated 66 to 70 Gy given as once -daily fractions over 6.5 to 7 weeks \nare acceptable options depending on individual patient \ncircumstances.108,251,257 The NCCN SCLC Panel maintains  that higher \ndoses of 66 to 70 Gy are preferred  if using once -daily fractionatio n,257 \nsince the t wice-daily thoracic radiation is logistically challenging for many \npatients and RT centers .  \nRadiation for Limited -Stage SCLC  \nExternal -Beam RT  \nFor limited -stage IIB to IIIC  disease (T3 –4, N0, M0; T1 –4, N1–3, M0), the \nNCCN Guidelines recommend that RT should be used concurrently with \nchemotherapy  and that RT should start with the first or second cycle \n(category 1  for patients with PS 0 –2).242,245 The optimal dose and schedule \nof RT have not been established. For accelerated  RT, the recommended \nschedule is 1.5 Gy twice daily to a total dose of 45 Gy in 3 weeks. For \nconventionally fractionated RT, the recommended schedule is 2.0 Gy once \ndaily to a total dose of 66 to 70 Gy .108,257 -260  \nThe minimum technical requirement for thoracic irradiation is CT -planned \n3D-conformal RT. Intensity -modulated RT (IMRT) is preferred over \n3D-conformal external -beam RT  (EBRT) because of lower toxicity. The \nnormal tissue constraints used for NSCLC are appropriate for SCLC when \nusing similar RT doses (see Principles of Radiation Therapy  in the \nalgorithm  and the NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, \navailable at www.NCCN.org ).261-266 More advanced technologies , such as \n4D-CT and proton therapy,  may also be appropriate to limit normal tissue \ntoxicity .

Patients who received \nchemotherapy after SABR had a median overall survival of 31.4 months \nversus  14.3 months for those who received  SABR alone ( P = .02).  \nAn analysis of 2107 patients with histologically confirmed T1 –T2, N0, M0 \nfrom the National Cancer Database found that 7.1% had upfront SABR \nfollowed by adjuvant chemotherapy and 92.9% had concurrent \nchemoradiation.10 Compared with patients receiving upfront concurrent \nchemoradiation, those receiving SABR were often older, had T1 disease, \nand treated recently in academic medical settings. Median survival was \n29.2 months in those receiving SABR/che motherapy versus  31.2 months in those receiving chemoradiation ( P = .77). Both ASTRO and the \nAmerican Radium Society recommend SABR followed by adjuvant \nchemotherapy as an option for medically inoperable patients with clinical \nlimited  stage I –IIA SCLC  (T1–2, N0).242,243  \nThe NCCN SCLC Panel recommends (category 2A) SABR followed by \nsystemic therapy as an option for select patients with clinical limited stage \nI–IIA (T1 –2, N0) who are medically inoperable or decline surgery.12,279 The \nNCCN SCLC Panel added a caveat that systemic therapy may be initiated \nfirst, if time to initiation of SABR will be prolonged.  The NCCN Guidelines \nfor NSCLC provide detailed recommendations for SABR  that may be \nuseful for SCLC (see Principles of  Radiation Therapy  in the NCCN \nGuidelines for NSCLC, available at www. NCCN .org).  \nRadiation for Extensive -Stage SCLC  \nSequential Thoracic Radiation for Extensive -Stage SCLC  \nA randomized trial by Jeremic et al280 assessed sequential (consolidative) \nthoracic RT in patients experiencing a complete response at distant \nmetastatic sites after 3 cycles of etoposide/cisplatin. Patients were \nrandomized to receive either 1) further etoposide/cisplatin ; or 2) \naccelerated hyperfractionated RT (i.e., 54 Gy in 36 fractions over 18 \ntreatment days) in combination with carboplatin plus etoposide.280 The \naddition of RT resulted in improved median overall survival (17 vs. 11 \nmonths). The Dutch CREST trial , a phase 3 randomized trial  in patients \nwith extensive -stage SCLC , reported that the addition of consolidative \nthoracic RT (30 Gy in 10 fractions) did not improve the primary endpoint of \n1-year overall survival (33% vs. 28 %; P = .066 ). A secondary analysis \nfound  improvement in 2 -year overall survival (13% vs. 3 %; P = .004) and \n6-month PFS compared with  patients who did not receive consolidative \nthoracic RT.281 A trial involving 32 patients who received consolidative \nthoracic RT reported that only 16% of patients had symptomatic chest \nrecurrences.282 Consolidative thoracic RT appears to mainly benefit \npatients with residual thoracic disease after chemo therapy  (without PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.

The benefit of thoracic RT in the context of \nchemoimmunotherapy  is under evaluation in the RAPTOR/NRG LU007 \ntrial (NCT04402788) .  \nProphylactic Cranial Irradiation  \nIntracranial metastases occur in greater  than 50% of patients with SCLC. \nRandomized studies show that PCI is effective in decreasing the incidence \nof cerebral metastases, but most individual studies did not have sufficient \npower to show a meaningful survival advantage.285 Several meta -analyses \nsuggest that PCI after complete resection may benefit patients with \npathologic stage IIB or  stage III SCLC.99,100,286 A meta -analysis of all \nrandomized PCI trials reported a reduction in the 3 -year incide nce of brain \nmetastases, from 58.6% in the control group to 33.3% in the PCI -treated \ngroup.100 Thus, PCI seems to prevent , and not simply delay , the \nemergence of brain metastases. This meta -analysis also reported a n \nincrease in 3 -year overall survival from 15.3% in the control group to \n20.7% in the PCI group.100 Although the number of patients with extensive -stage SCLC  was small, the observed benefit was similar in \npatients with both limited -stage and extensive -stage SCLC . A \nretrospective study of patients with limited -stage SCLC  also found that PCI \nincreased survival at 2, 5, and 10 years compared with those who did not \nreceive PCI.287 A study of 184 patients with limited -stage SCLC assessed \nPCI versus  no PCI in patients who responded to chemoradiotherapy , and \nwho had no brain metastases on MRI imaging before and after primary \ntreatment.288 In patients receiving PCI, median overall survival was 26 \nmonths (range, 19.4 –32.6 months) versus  14 months for those without \nPCI (range, 11.4 –16.6 months; P < .0001).  \nNone of the abovementioned studies in limited -stage SCLC used MRI \nstaging of the brain or FDG -PET scans for overall staging.  A retrospective \nstudy included 49 patients with limited -stage SCLC who were staged with \nbrain MRI before treatment.289 The median overall survival was 55 months \nin patients with limited -stage SCLC who received PCI versus  24 months in \nthose  who did not receive PCI ( P < .05). At 1 year, the probability of \ndeveloping symptomatic brain metastases was 4% in patients with \nlimited -stage SCLC who received PCI versus  22% in those who did not \nreceive PCI ( P < .05). For patients with extensive -stage SCLC, but without \nbrain metastases, a large retrospective analysis of 4257 patients showed \nthat PCI improved median overall survival com pared with no PCI (13.9 vs. \n11.1 months; P < .0001).290 Another analysis of patients with \nextensive -stage SCLC (n = 397) reported that PCI improved overall \nsurvival compared with no PCI (13.5 vs. 8.5 months, respectively; HR, \n0.55; 95% CI, 0.39 –0.77; P = .0005); however, these patients did not \nreceive routine brain imaging  surveillance .291  \nThe EORTC performed a randomized trial that assessed PCI versus  no \nPCI in 286 patients with extensive -stage SCLC that had responded to \ninitial chemotherapy .

Conflicting data from a randomized phase 3 trial in Japan  \nfound that median overall survival is not improved in patients receiving PCI \ncompared with  MRI surveillance  (11.6 months ; 95% CI, 9.5 –13 vs. 13.7 \nmonths ; 95% CI, 10.2 –16.4) (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.96 –1.68; P = .094).293 In \nthis trial, patients were required to have an MRI to confirm that they did not \nhave brain metastases prior to PCI, and the PCI regimen was \nstandardized at 25 Gy in 10 fractions. In addition, the study required close \nMRI surveillance imaging in patients  to allow for the early treatment of \nbrain metastases. The American Radium Society recommends either PCI \nor brain MRI surveillance  for patients with extensive -stage SCLC and \nwithout brain metastases based on the limited data.241 A randomized trial \n(SWOG S1827/MAVERICK) is currently assessing brain MRI surveillance \nalone compared  to brain MRI surveillance plus PCI for patients with \nlate-stage SCLC and early -stage SCLC. Late neurologic sequelae have \nbeen attributed to PCI, particularly in studies using fractions greater than 3 \nGy and/or administering PCI concurrently with chemotherapy.185,294,295 \nThus, PCI is not recommended for patients with poor PS (3 –4) or impaired \nneurocognitive function.97,296 PCI has also been associated with chronic \nneurotoxicity  in patients who are a ged ≥60 years .184,186  \nThe NCCN SCLC Panel has gradually revised the adjuvant \nrecommendations for patients whose disease showed  a complete or \npartial response after primary treatment based on conflicting clinical trial \ndata and concerns about using PCI. Before a decision is made to \nadminister PCI, a balanced discussion is necessary between the patient \nand physician.185,297 The NCCN Panel recommends considering PCI for \npatients with limited -stage SCLC  that have achieved  a complete or partial \nresponse.97,100,292 PCI should be administered prior to consolidation \ndurvalumab therapy. The NCCN Panel maintains that the benefit  of PCI is \nunclear in patients with very early -stage SCLC (pathologic limited -stage I [T1–2a, N0, M0]) who have had definitive therapy  (i.e., surgery, SABR ). \nThese patients  have a lower risk of developing  brain metastases than \npatients with more advanced limited -stage SCLC  and may not benefit from \nPCI.99,279,298 The NCCN Panel recommend s MRI brain surveillance for all \npatients with limited -stage SCLC who do not receive PCI.  In patients with \nextensive -stage SCLC , the NCCN Panel recommends  MRI brain  \nsurveillance with or without consideration of PCI based on the conflicting \ntrial results from Japan and the EORTC.292,293 Brain imaging surveillance \nfor metastases is recommended using either MRI (preferred) or CT with \ncontrast in patients who are unable to undergo MRI.293  \nHigher PCI doses (e .g., 36 Gy) increased mortality and toxicity compared \nwith lower doses (25 Gy).184,299 Therefore, the preferred dose for PCI is 25 \nGy in 10 daily fractions (2.5 Gy/fraction).100,292,299 A shorter course of PCI \nmay be appropriate (e .g., 20 Gy in 5 fractions) for selected patients with \nextensive -stage SCLC .292 PCI should not be given concurrently with \nchemotherapy, and high total RT dose (>30 Gy) should be avoided \nbecause of the increased risk of neurotoxicity.184 After the acute toxicities \nof initial systemic therapy have resolved, PCI can be administered. When \ngiven after the completion of chemotherapy and at a low dos e per fraction , \nPCI may cause less neurologic toxicity. Fatigue, headache, and \nnausea/vomiting are the most common acute toxic effects after PCI.296,299  \nThe NCCN SCLC Panel recommends that memantine be considered for \npatients receiving PCI or therapeutic whole -brain irradiation.  Memantine is \na N-methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that may delay \ncognitive dysfunction in patients receiving brain RT.300 Patients receiving \nmemantine ha ve a longer time before cognitive decline (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, \n0.62–0.99; P = .01).

However, conflicting data have \nbeen reported with HA-PCI versus  conventional PCI. PREMER, a phase 3 \nrandomized trial,  reported improved cognitive preservation with HA-PCI.302 \nHowever , another phase 3 randomized trial (NCT01780675) reported no \ndifferences in cognition  with HA PCI .303 A large randomized trial (NRG \nCC003) is assessing HA-PCI versus  conventional PCI.304  \nPalliative Radiation Therapy  \nFor patients with localized symptomatic sites of disease  (i.e., painful bony \nlesions, spinal cord compression, obstructive atelectasis) or with brain \nmetastases, RT can provide excellent palliation (see the algorithm  and the \nNCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).305-307 Orthopedic stabilization may be useful in patients \nat high risk for fracture because of osseous structural impairment. \nBecause patients with SCLC often have a short life span, surgery is not \nusually recommended for spinal cord compression. Radiation dose and \nfractionation for extracranial metastases include 30 Gy in 10 fractions, 20 \nGy in 5 fractions, or 8 Gy in 1 fraction based on common \ndose -fractionation regimens used for other solid tumors . Brain metastases \nhave conventionally been treated with whole brain RT in patients with \nSCLC due to the frequent occurrence of multiple metastases . The \nrecommended dose for whole -brain RT is 30 Gy in 10 daily fractions.308 \nAlso, s ee the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC, available at www.N CCN .org). \nIMRT, SABR, or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may be appropriate for \nselect patients (e .g., those whose tumors are in clo se proximity to organs \nat risk).  \nA retrospective multicenter cohort study assessed SRS versus  \nwhole -brain RT in 710 patients with SCLC who had a limited number of \nbrain metastases; overall survival was 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.5 –8.0) for \nSRS and 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.4 –6.7) for whole -brain RT (P = .003).309 A \nmeta -analysis of nine observational studies (163 8 patients) also reported favorable lesion control and survival outcomes with SRS versus  \nwhole -brain RT.310 A randomized trial (NRG CC009) is comparing SRS to \nHA whole -brain IMRT plus memantine in this setting. The  NCCN Panel \ndecided  that SRS may be used for selected patients with a small number \nof brain metastases based on available data, pending outcomes of the \nongoing trials.309 In patients who develop brain metastases after PCI, SRS \n(preferred) or repeat whole -brain RT (in carefully selected patients) may \nbe considered.311,312 For patients with a better prognosis (e .g., ≥4 months), \nHA whole -brain IMRT plus memantine is preferred because it produces \nless of a decrease in cognitive function  than conventional whole -brain RT \nplus memantine. However, patients with metastases within 5 mm of the \nhippocampi, leptomeningeal metastases, and other high -risk features were \nnot eligible for HA whole -brain IMRT in the phase 3 NRG CC001  trial.301  \nSummary  \nIn summary, t he NCCN Guidelines for SCLC v1. 2025 has \nrecommendations for diagnosis, evaluation, therapy options and \nsurveillance for both limited -stage and extensive -stage SCLC. These \nrecommendations are based on data from clinical trials and Panel \nexpertise.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:05:27 PM.
