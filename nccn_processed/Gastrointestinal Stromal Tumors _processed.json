However, percutaneous image-guided biopsy may be appropriate for the confirmation of locally advanced or metastatic \ndisease. Consideration of biopsy should be based on the suspected tumor type and extent of disease. Biopsy is necessary to confirm the \ndiagnosis of primary GIST prior to the initiation of preoperative therapy.\n• Morphologic diagnosis based on microscopic examination of histologic sections is the standard for GIST diagnosis. Several ancillary \ntechniques are recommended in support of GIST diagnosis, including IHC for SDHB, CD117, and DOG1, and molecular genetic testing for KIT \nand PDGFRA mutations, as well as other potential drivers (eg, BRAF, NF1, NTRK, and FGFR  fusions). See GIST-B.\n• Diagnosis is based on the Principles of Pathologic Assessment ( NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma ); referral to centers with \nexpertise and experience in the diagnosis and management of GIST/sarcoma is recommended for those patients with complex or unusual \nhistopathologic features.\n• Risk stratification: \n\u0017Pathologic grading by mitotic rate may not be accurate in small biopsies. Mitotic rate information might be inaccurate following \nneoadjuvant therapy, if there is other evidence of pathologic treatment effect (necrosis, reduced cellularity, etc.). If risk stratification is \nperformed on a small biopsy or on a resection specimen following neoadjuvant therapy, there is potential for inaccuracies in the mitotic \nrate. In this situation, risk stratification may need to be based on clinical parameters, size, and anatomic location instead.  \n\u0017Tumor size and mitotic rate are used to predict the malignant potential of GIST, although it is notoriously difficult to predict the biologic \nbehavior of GIST based on pathologic features alone; thus, guidelines for risk stratification by tumor site have been developed. \n\u0017Most gastric GIST behave in an indolent manner, especially when less than 2 cm. See Table 1 (GIST-A 2 of 3) for Guidelines for Assessing \nthe Malignant Potential.\n\u0017For non-gastric GIST, see Table 2 (GIST-A 3 of 3) for Guidelines for Assessing the Malignant Potential. \n ◊GIST of the small intestine tends to be more aggressive than its gastric counterpart. \n ◊GIST of the colon is most commonly seen in the rectum; colorectal GIST tends to have an aggressive biological behavior, and tumors \nwith mitotic activity can recur and metastasize despite a small size of <2 cm.\n\u0017Some stratification schemes have included tumor rupture, which has been associated with a much higher risk of recurrence.  \nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:09 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion\nGIST-BPRINCIPLES OF MUTATION TESTING\n• Approximately 80% of GIST have a mutation in the gene encoding the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase; another 5%–10% of GIST have a mutation in the gene \nencoding the related PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinase. The presence and type of KIT and PDGFRA mutations are not strongly correlated with prognosis.  \n• The mutations in KIT and PDGFRA in GIST result in expression of mutant proteins with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Testing for KIT and PDGFRA \nmutations should be performed if TKIs are considered as part of the treatment plan since the presence of mutations (or absence of mutations) in specific regions \nof the KIT and PDGFRA genes are correlated with response (or lack of a response) to specific TKIs.  \n• Specific mutations in KIT or PDGFRA show some correlation with tumor phenotype, but mutations are not strongly correlated with the biologic potential of \nindividual tumors. The accumulated data show that KIT mutations are not preferentially present in high-grade tumors, and can also be found in small incidental \ntumors as well as tumors that have an indolent course. Similarly, mutational analysis of PDGFRA cannot be used to predict the behavior of individual tumors.  \n• GIST have different response rates to imatinib based upon the tumor mutation status: KIT exon 9 mutations have a lower response rate and progression-free \nsurvival (PFS) than exon 11 tumors at 400 mg, but dosing at 400 mg BID has been associated with better PFS. Most PDGFRA mutations are associated with a \nresponse to imatinib, with the exception of D842V, which responds to avapritinib and is unlikely to respond to imatinib and most other approved TKIs for GIST.  \n• Metastatic disease with acquired drug resistance is usually the result of secondary, imatinib-resistant mutations in KIT or PDGFRA. Sunitinib treatment is \nindicated for patients with imatinib-resistant tumors or imatinib intolerance. Regorafenib is indicated for patients with disease progression on imatinib and \nsunitinib. Ripretinib is indicated for patients who have received prior treatment with 3 or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. Ripretinib is also an option \nfor GIST with PDGFRA exon 18 mutations that are insensitive to imatinib and were previously treated with both avapritinib and dasatinib. An additional clinical \nbenefit may be obtained with the use of ripretinib 150 mg BID upon progression on ripretinib 150 mg daily. Referral to clinical trial is strongly recommended for \npatients with mutations resistant to imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, ripretinib, and avapritinib.\n• About 10%–15% of GIST lack mutations in KIT or PDGFRA. The vast majority of these GIST have functional inactivation of the SDH complex, which can be \ndetected by lack of expression of SDHB on IHC. Inactivation of the SDH complex may result from a mutation or from epigenetic silencing. A small minority of GIST \nwith loss of SDH expression have alternative driver mutations.   \n• All GIST lacking a KIT or PDGFRA mutation should be tested for SDH deficiency and alternative driver mutations using NGS. \n\u0017Alternative driver mutations (eg, BRAF, NF1, NTRK, and FGFR fusions) may be detected by NGS to identify potential targeted therapies. \n\u0017Tissue biopsy is preferred; novel approaches (eg, circulating tumor DNA [ctDNA]) may be appropriate in select cases. \n\u0017If a molecular profile has been completed that is negative for mutations, consider consulting the laboratory that performed the test or an expert in molecular \ntesting (pathologist, medical geneticist, etc) to ensure the ordered test is able to detect all molecular aberrations of interest. If not, re-testing to include \nappropriate tests is required.  \n \n• GIST with SDH mutations typically arise in the stomach in younger individuals, frequently metastasize, may involve lymph nodes, and usually grow slowly. They \nare usually resistant to imatinib. SDH-deficient tumors may benefit from therapy with sunitinib or regorafenib. Referral to a genetic counselor for germline testing \nassessment is recommended for all patients with SDH-deficient GIST and those with GIST that have SDH mutations. Patients with SDH germline mutations are at \nrisk of paraganglioma; 24-hour urine testing is recommended prior to surgery (GIST-C).\n• NF1-associated GIST typically arise in the small bowel, may be multifocal, and often have an indolent biology. They should be tested for classic mutations in KIT \nand PDGFRA because they may contain those as well. Patients who have an NF1-associated GIST should be referred for genetic counseling if they have not been \nevaluated previously. Data supporting the use of TKI for NF1-associated GIST in the absence of a KIT or PDGFRA mutation are limited. Participation in a clinical \ntrial can be considered.  \n• Germline KIT and PDGFRA testing should be considered for the following: patients with a family history of GIST and/or melanoma, patients with multifocal GIST, \nand/or patients with NF1 or SDH-deficient GIST.

Segmental or wedge resection to obtain negative \nmargins is often appropriate.\n• Lymphadenectomy is usually not required given the low incidence of nodal metastases; however, resection of pathologically enlarged nodes should be considered in \npatients with known SDH-deficient GIST or known translocation-associated GIST . \n• As GIST tends to be very fragile, every effort should be made not to violate the pseudocapsule of the tumor (ie, avoid tumor rupture—any tumor spillage or fracture, \nlaceration of the tumor capsule with or without macroscopic spillage, and piecemeal resection).\n• Incisional biopsy occurring either before or at the time of the operation should be strictly avoided.\n• Re-resection is generally not indicated for microscopically positive margins (R1) on final pathology .\nResection should be accomplished with minimal morbidity and, in general, complex multivisceral resection should be avoided. If the surgeon feels that a multivisceral \nresection may be required, then multidisciplinary consultation is indicated regarding a course of preoperative therapy (ie, imatinib or avapritinib). Similarly , rectal GIST \nshould be approached via a sphincter-sparing approach. If abdominoperineal resection (APR) would be necessary to achieve a negative margin resection, then preoperative \nimatinib should be considered.\nA minimally invasive approach may be considered for select GIST in favorable anatomic locations by surgeons with appropriate minimally invasive experience. \n• All oncologic principles of GIST resection must still be followed, including preservation of the pseudocapsule and avoidance of tumor spillage.\n• Resection specimens should be removed from the abdomen in a plastic bag to prevent spillage or seeding of port sites. \nUnresectable GIST\nMolecularly guided therapy is the primary treatment for unresectable GIST; see Principles of Systemic Therapy (GIST-E). Surgery may be indicated for:\n• Previously unresectable tumors after a favorable response to systemic therapy.\n• Management of symptomatic bleeding, obstruction, or perforation.\nMetastatic GIST\nMolecularly guided therapy is the primary therapy for metastatic GIST. Surgery (peritoneal cytoreduction and/or liver metastasectomy) may be indicated in the following \norder:\n• Stage IV disease after a favorable response to systemic therapy when complete cytoreduction of peritoneal and/or hepatic disease can be accomplished by an experienced \nsurgeon\n• Unifocal progression of disease that is refractory to TKI therapy when other sites of disease are having a favorable response to therapy\n• Low-volume multifocal progressive disease that is safely resectable\n• Management of symptomatic bleeding, obstruction, or perforation  \nConsiderations Prior to Surgery  \n• Imatinib can be stopped right before surgery and restarted as soon as the patient is able to tolerate oral medications. If other TKIs such as sunitinib, regorafenib, ripretinib, \nor avapritinib are being used, therapy should be stopped at least 1 week prior to surgery and can be restarted based on clinical judgment or recovery from surgery .\n• Patients with SDH germline mutations are at risk of paraganglioma; 24-hour urine testing is recommended prior to surgery and therefore serum/urine catecholamine/\nmetanephrine testing should be performed prior to surgery.

Conventional TACE involves targeted infusion of \nchemotherapeutic medications in addition to embolic agents and lipiodol into tumoral blood supply while DEB-TACE drug delivery is \nthrough embolic beads loaded with chemotherapeutic medication.\n ◊TACE can be an effective and a well-tolerated treatment in patients with GIST with liver metastases not responsive to TKIs.3,4\n\u0017Transarterial Radioembolization (TARE)\n ◊TARE utilizes beta particle emitting microspheres by yttrium-90 decay to induce tumoricidal effects through local brachytherapy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors  \nMS-2 Overview \nGastrointestinal stromal tumors (G IST) are the most common STS of the \nGI tract, resulting primarily  from KIT or PDGFRA  activating mutations.1 \nThe annual incidence of GIST in the United States is estimated to be \nbetween 0.68 to 0.78 per 100,000.2-5 GIST can arise anywhere along the \nGI tract, but stomach (60%) and small intestine (30%) are the most \ncommon primary sites.6 Duodenum (4% –5%) and rectum (4%) are less \ncommon primary sites, and only a small number of cases have been reported in the esophagus (<1%) and colon and appendix (1% –2%).\n6 In \nvery rare occasions, GIST can occur in extraintestinal sites. Patients with \na suspected GIST may present with a variety of symptoms, which may \ninclude early satiety, abdominal discomfort due to pain or swelling, \nintraperitoneal hemorrhage, GI bleeding, or fatigue related to anemia. \nSome patients may present with an acute abdomen (as a result of tumor rupture, GI obstruction, or peritonitis -like pain), which requires immediate \nmedical attention. Liver and/or the peritoneal surfaces  are the most \ncommon sites of metastases, whereas l ymph node metastases are \nextremely rare , except in select GIST subtypes . Metastases in the lungs, \nbone,  and other extra -abdominal locations are observed only in advanced \ncases.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors  \nMS-3 General Principles  \nBiopsy and Pathologic Assessment  \nGIST are soft and fragile tumors. The decision to obtain a biopsy should \nbe based on the suspected tumor type and the extent of disease. Biopsy is \nnecessary to confirm the diagnosis of primary GIST prior to the initiation of \npreoperative therapy.7 Recent reports have suggested that definitive \ndiagnosis of GIST requires tissue acquisition via endoscopic ultrasound \n(EUS) -guided FNA.8 EUS-guided FNA (EUS -FNA) biopsy of primary site is \npreferred over percutaneous biopsy due to the risk of tumor hemorrhage and intra -abdominal tumor dissemination. Percutaneous image -guided \nbiopsy may be appropriate for confirmation of metastatic disease.  \nMorphologic diagnosis based on careful microscopic examination of \nadequate tumor tissue is essential to confirm the diagnosis of GIST. \nPathology report should include anatomic location, size, and an accurate \nassessment of the mitotic rate measured in the m ost proliferative area of \nthe tumor and reported as the number of mitoses in 50 high- power fields \n(HPFs) (equivalent to 5 mm\n2 of tissue). The differential diagnosis of GIST \nshould be considered for any GI sarcoma, as well as for any other \nintra-abdominal s arcoma. The panel recommends referral to centers with \nexpertise in sarcomas for cases with complex or unusual histopathologic \nfeatures.  \nMost GIST (95%) express KIT (CD117). Approximately 80% of GIST have \na mutation in the gene encoding the KIT  receptor tyrosine kinase; another \n5% to 10% of GIST have a mutation in the gene encoding the related PDGFRA  receptor tyrosine kinase.\n9-11 About 10% to 15% of GIST have no \ndetectable KIT or PDGFRA  mutations (wild -type GIST). Other commonly \nexpressed markers include CD34 antigen (70%), smooth muscle actin \n(25%), and desmin (less than 5%).12 Most of the KIT  mutations occur in the juxtamembrane domain encoded by \nKIT exon 11 and some are detected in the extracellular domain encoded \nby exon 9.13 KIT mutations have also been identified in the tyrosine kinase \ndomain (exon 13 and exon 17), although they are very rare.14 The majority \nof the PDGFRA  mutations affect exon 18 in the tyrosine kinase domain \n2.13 Few mutations also occur in exon 12 (juxtamembrane domain) and \nexon 14 (tyrosine kinase domain 1), although they are rare.15 KIT exon 11 \nmutations are most common in GIST of all sites, whereas KIT  exon 9 \nmutations are specific for intestinal GIST and PDGFRA  exon 18 mutations \nare common in gastric GIST.13  \nImmunohistochemical staining for CD117, DOG1, and/or CD34 and \nmolecular genetic testing to identify KIT  and/or PDGFRA  mutations are \nuseful in the diagnosis of GIST. However, KIT  positivity alone may not be \nsufficient to confirm the diagnosis and, conversely, the absence of KIT \nand/or PDFGRA mutations does not exclude the diagnosis of GIST. In \nGIST with PDGFRA  mutations, immunostaining with PDGFRA  has been \nshown to be helpful in discriminating between KIT-negative GIST and \nother GI mesenchymal lesions.  \nLoss -of-function mutations in the SDH gene subunits or loss of SDHB \nprotein expression by IHC have been identified in a majority of wild- type \nGIST lacking KIT and PDGFRA  mutations; these findings have led to the \nuse of the term SDH -deficient GIST, which is preferred over the older \nterm, wild -type GIST, for this subset of GIST.16-20 SDHB IHC can be useful \nfor the diagnosis of SDH- deficient GIST. BRAF exon 15 mutation (V600E)  \nhas also been reported in a small subset of patients with intestinal \nhigh- risk GIST lacking KIT/PDGFRA  mutations.21,22 DOG1 is a calcium -\ndependent, receptor -activated chloride channel protein and it is expressed \nin GIST independent of mutation type. DOG1 expression was not different \nbetween the KIT/PDGFRA  mutant or wild -type GIST, but there was a clear \ndistinction between tumors with PDGFRA  and KIT mutations.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors  \nMS-4 PDGFRA  mutations had a low KIT  expression and high DOG1 expression, \nwhich can be used in the diagnosis of KIT -negative tumors.23 DOG1 \nimmunostaining may be useful for cases that cannot be categorized as \nGIST based on CD117 immunostaining and mutation testing for KIT  and \nPDGFRA . DOG1 and KIT  could be used together in difficult cases \nexhibiting unexpected KIT  negativity or positivity.7 \nTumors lacking KIT and PDGFRA  mutations should be considered for \nfurther evaluations such as SDHB immunostaining. If the tumor is SDH -\ndeficient, germline testing for SDH  mutations would be indicated. \nInactivating NF1 mutations or activating BRAF  mutations are present in a \nsmall minority of tumors that lack KIT and PDGFRA  mutations but retain \nSDH expression.  \nPrognostic Factors  \nTumor size and the mitotic rate are the most widely used pathologic features for the risk stratification of GIST. However, it is difficult to predict \nthe malignant potential of GIST based on these features alone. In a \nlong- term follow -up of 1765 patients w ith gastric GIST, Miettinen and \ncolleagues reported that the metastatic rate was 86% for tumors >10 cm \nwith a mitotic index of >5 mitoses/50 HPFs, whereas tumors of the same \nsize with a mitotic index of <5 mitoses/50 HPFs have a relatively low \nmetastatic r ate of 11%.\n24 In a subsequent report involving 906 patients \nwith small intestinal GIST, tumors >10 cm with a mitotic index of ≤5 \nmitoses/50 HPF had a metastatic rate of 50%, which is a contrast to that \nreported for gastric GIST with similar tumor parameters.25 Therefore, in \naddition to the tumor size and mitotic rate, tumor site has also been included in the guidelines developed by Miettinen and colleagues for the \nrisk stratification of primary GIST.\n6 According to these guidelines, gastric \nGIST have an overall indolent behavior and those that are ≤2 cm (irrespective of the mitotic index) are essentially benign, whereas small \nintestinal GIST tend to be more aggressive. Rectal GIST are also very aggressive, and tumors <2 cm with a mitotic index of >5 mitoses/50 HPFs have a higher risk of recurrence and malignant potential.  \nMutations can be found in high- grade tumors as well as in small incidental \nGIST and tumors that have a benign course. Therefore, KIT  mutational \nstatus is not used to determine the malignant potential of a primary GIST. Tumor genotype has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor \nbased on review of 1056 patients with localized GIST in the ConticaGIST \ndatabase. Factors associated with poorer DFS were KIT  exon 9 \nduplication, KIT exon 11 deletions, nongastric site, larger tumor size, and \nhigh mitotic in dex, whereas  PDGFRA  exon 18 mutations were associated \nwith better prognosis.26 Long- term follow- up (median 73 months) from the \nBFR14 trial by the French Sarcoma Group identified female sex as an \nindependent prognostic factor for higher PFS and OS in patients treated \nwith standard- dose imatinib.27  \nThe presence and the type of KIT  or PDGFRA  mutation status are \npredictive of response to TKI therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic GIST. GIST with SDH mutations are also less sensitive to TKIs. \nThey typically arise in the stomach and are observed in younger individuals, frequently metastasize, may feature lymph node involvement, \nand tend to grow slowly. See Impact of Mutational Status on Response to \nImatinib or Sunitinib in Patients with Advanced or Metastatic GIST in this \nDiscussion. \nImaging  \nIn patients with GIST, imaging is used for diagnosis, initial staging, \nrestaging, monitoring response to therapy, and performing follow -up \nsurveillance of possible recurrence. Contrast -enhanced CT is the imaging \nmodality of choice to characterize an abdominal mass, as well as to \nevaluate its extent and the presence or absence of metastasis at the initial \nstaging workup for biopsy -proven GIST.

PET provides \nsignificant value to the standard CT images, because changes in the \nmetabolic activity of tumors often precede anat omic changes on CT. \nHowever, PET is not a substitute for CT. PET/CT may be used to clarify ambiguous findings seen on CT or MRI or to assess complex metastatic \ndisease in patients who are being considered for surgery. Even in this \nclinical setting there is  no clear evidence that PET provides significant \ninformation that cannot be obtained using IV contrast -enhanced CT. PET \nmay be of benefit in patients with IV contrast allergy, particularly for \nperitoneal disease; MRI with or without contrast usually yields  excellent \nanatomical definition of liver metastases.\n7 If clinicians consider using PET \nto monitor therapy, a baseline PET should be obtained prior to the start of \ntherapy.  \nResponse Assessment  \nTo assess response to TKI therapy, abdominal/pelvic CT or MRI is \nindicated every 8 to 12 weeks. PET may give an indication of imatinib \nactivity after 2 to 4 weeks if rapid read- out is necessary.28 Various CT \nresponse criteria have been investigated and compared in patients with \nGIST, including iterations of RECIST, Choi, and WHO criteria. 29-35  \nExperts have advocated that the CT response criteria proposed by Choi \nare much better than RECIST criteria to assess the response of GIST to \nTKI therapy. Choi criteria have been validated in one center in patients \nwith GIST who had not previously received TKI therapy.29 However, these \ncriteria are not universally accepted, they have not been validated for \npatients who have received several targeted therapies, and the ease of \nuse outside specialized centers is unknown. Some recent studies have \nsupported the use of RECIST,  WHO, or volumetric criteria for sunitinib or \nregorafenib response assessment following progression on imatinib.32-34  The EORTC developed metabolic response criteria for tumors evaluated \nwith PET that provide definitions for complete metabolic response, partial metabolic response, stable metabolic disease, or disease metabolic \nprogression.\n36 However, since there is a 95% correlation between the \ninformation from regular contrast -enhanced CT and PET/CT, CT with IV \ncontrast is the preferred routine imaging modality for patients with GIST on \nTKI therapy.  \nSurgery  \nSurgery is the primary treatment of choice for patients with localized or potentially resectable GIST lesions. Preoperative imatinib can be \nconsidered to decrease surgical morbidity. If persistent metastatic or \nresidual tumor remains after surgery, then im atinib should be continued as \nsoon as the patient is able to tolerate oral intake.  \nGIST are fragile and should be handled with care to avoid tumor rupture. \nThe goal is to achieve complete gross resection of the tumor with an intact \npseudocapsule. After removal of any suspected GIST, postoperative \npathology assessment is essential to conf irm the diagnosis. Segmented or \nwedge resection to obtain negative margins is often appropriate. \nLymphadenectomy is usually not required given the low incidences of \nnodal metastases, but resection of pathologically enlarged nodes should \nbe considered in patients with SDH- deficient GIST. Resection should be \naccomplished with minimal morbidity and complex multivisceral resection should be avoided. Re- resection is generally not indicated for \nmicroscopically positive margins on final pathology. If abdominoperineal resection w ould be necessary to achieve a negative margin, then \npreoperative imatinib should be considered. If the surgeon feels that a complex surgical procedure is required, then a multidisciplinary \nconsultation regarding the use of preoperative imat inib is recommended.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors  \nMS-6 Sphincter -sparing surgery and esophagus -sparing surgery should be \nconsidered for rectal and gastroesophageal junction GIST, respectively. \nSeveral case reports have demonstrated that the use of preoperative \nimatinib enables organ- sparing surgery and improves surgical outcomes in \npatients with rectal GIST.7 \nThe role for laparoscopy in the resection of GIST continues to expand. \nAlthough prospective studies are lacking, literature reports based on a \nsmall series of patients and retrospective analyses have demonstrated \nthat not only are laparoscopic or laparoscopic -assisted resections \npossible, but they are also associated with low recurrence rates, short hospital stay duration, and low morbidity.\n7 A meta -analysis of 19 studies (n \n= 1060 GIST cases) revealed no difference in long- term outcomes of GIST \nresections using laparotomy and laparoscopy, but laparoscopic \napproaches were associated with less blood loss, lower complication \nrates, and shorter hospital stays.37 \nLaparoscopic approach may be considered for selected GIST in favorable \nanatomic locations such as anterior wall of the stomach, jejunum, and \nileum. The same surgical principles of complete macroscopic resection, \nincluding the preservation of the pseudocaps ule and avoidance of tumor \nrupture, should be followed during laparoscopy. Resection specimen should be removed from the abdomen in a plastic bag to avoid spillage or \nseeding of port sites. Laparoscopic surgery could be feasible in other \nanatomic sites, such as smaller rectal GIST. However, data on \nlaparoscopic resection of GIST at other sites are limited.  \nTargeted Therapy  \nGIST have previously been documented to be resistant to conventional \nchemotherapies. Since KIT  activation occurs in the majority of cases of \nGIST, KIT inhibition has emerged as the primary therapeutic modality along with surgery for the treatment of GIST.  Imatinib  \nImatinib, a selective inhibitor of the KIT protein tyrosine kinase, has \nproduced durable clinical benefit and objective responses in most patients \nwith GIST. In phase II and III studies, imatinib has resulted in high overall \nresponse rates and exceptionally good PFS in patients with unresectable \nand/or metastatic GIST, inducing objective responses in more than 50% of \nthe patients.38-42 In February 2002, the FDA approved use of imatinib for \nthe treatment of patients with KIT-positive unresectable and/or metastatic \nmalignant GIST. Long -term follow- up results of the B2222 study (n = 147, \nrandomly assigned to receive 400 or 600 mg of imatinib daily) confirmed that imatinib induces durable disease control in patients with advanced \nGIST.\n43 The estimated 9- year OS rate was 35% for all patients, 38% for \nthose with CR or PR, and 49% for those with stable disease. Low tumor bulk at baseline predicted for longer TTP and improved OS.  \nTwo separate phase III studies (EORTC 62005 study and the \nS0033/CALGB 150105 study) have assessed the efficacy of imatinib at \ntwo initial dose levels (400 mg daily vs. 800 mg daily, given as 400 mg \ntwice a day) in patients with metastatic or unresectable G IST.\n39,40,42 Both \nstudies showed equivalent response rates and OS for both dose levels. Higher dose of imatinib was associated with more side effects than the \nlower dose in both studies. Although initial findings from the EORTC \n62005 study (n = 946) suggested an earli er TTP for patients receiving 400 \nmg daily,\n39 at a median follow -up of 10.9 years, no significant differences \nin survival were observed based on imatinib dose level.44 In the 400 -mg \ndaily vs. 800 -mg daily cohort, 10 -year PFS rates were 9.5% versus 9.2% \n(HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.79 –1.04; P = .18) and 10 -year OS rates were 19.4% \nand 21.5%, respectively (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.80 –1.07; P = .31). Similarly, \nthe S0033/CALGB 150105 study (n = 746) reported identical response \nrates (40% vs. 42%, respectively) at a median follow -up of 4.5 years and \nthere were no statistical differences in PFS (18 months for low -dose arm \nvs. 40 months for highe r-dose arm) and median OS (55 and 51 months,  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:09 PM.

In patients with recurrent or metastatic GIST, PR and stable \ndisease were observed in 4.5% and 91% of patients, respectively. The \nestimated 2 -year OS rate was 93% and 91% for patients with primary \nGIST and those with recurrent or metastatic GIST, respectively. The estimated 2 -year PFS rate was 83% and 77%, respectively.  \nIn a study conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center, 19 patients undergoing surgical resection for primary GIST (with or without \nmetastases) or recurrent disease (local or metastatic) were randomized to \nreceive 3, 5, or 7 days of preoperative imatinib (600 m g daily).\n46 The \nresponse rate assessed by FDG -PET and dynamic CT was 69% and 71%, \nrespectively. Median DFS of patients treated with surgery and imatinib \nwas 46 months. Tumor size was a predictor of recurrence after \npostoperative imatinib. However, in this study, ther e was no histologic \nevidence of cytoreduction within 3 to 7 days of preoperative imatinib.  In another prospective study, Fiore and colleagues reported that preoperative imatinib improved resectability and reduced surgical \nmorbidity in patients with primary GIST, unresectable or resectable \nthrough a major surgical procedure with significant surgi cal morbidity. \nMedian size reduction was 34% and the estimated 3- year PFS rate was \n77%.\n47 Imatinib was continued postoperatively for 2 years in all patients.  \nIn the subgroup analysis of patients with non -metastatic, locally advanced, \nprimary GIST treated with imatinib within the prospective BFR14 phase III \nstudy, preoperative imatinib was associated with a PR rate of 60% (15 of \n25 patients), and 36% (9 of 25 pa tients) of patients underwent surgical \nresection of primary tumor after a median of 7.3 months of imatinib treatment.\n48 All patients who underwent resection were treated with \npostoperative imatinib. The 3- year PFS and OS rates were 67% and 89%, \nrespectively, for patients who underwent resection.  All patients who \nunderwent resection were treated with postoperative imatinib.  \nWhile the results of these prospective studies have demonstrated the \nsafety and efficacy of preoperative imatinib in patients undergoing surgical \nresection, survival benefit could not be determined since all patients \nincluded in 3 of these studies also rec eived postoperative imatinib \npostoperatively for 2 years.45,46,48 Maximal response may require treatment \nfor ≥6 months. Preoperative imatinib may prohibit accurate assessment of \nrecurrence risk and should be considered only if surgical morbidity could be reduced by downstaging the tumor preoperatively. At the present time, \nthe decision to use preoperative imatinib for patients with resectable \nprimary or locally advanced or recurrent GIST should be made on an individual basis.  \nPostoperative Imatinib  \nSurgery does not routinely cure GIST.

A \nretrospective review of 506 patients with completely resected GIST \nrevealed the potential for underestimating risk of recurrence, particularly in \nthe case of  intermedi ate size, intermediate- level mitotic count, and non -\ngastric tumors.52 The data suggested that at least 3 years of adjuvant \ntreatment was associated with higher RFS for patients with higher -risk \ndisease. Multiple randomized studies have investigated the optimal \nduration of adjuvant therapy for resected GIST.  \nImatinib therapy was investigated in a phase III, double- blind study \n(ACOSOG Z9001) that randomized patients with primary localized GIST \n(≥3 cm in size) to postoperative imatinib 400 mg (317 patients) or placebo \n(328 patients) for one year after complete resection.53 At a median \nfollow- up of 74 months, the RFS rate was significantly higher in the \nimatinib arm compared to placebo (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.43 –0.75; Cox \nmodel adjusted  P < .001). OS was not significantly different between the \nimatinib and placebo arms.54 Further analyses revealed that imatinib \ntherapy was associated with higher RFS in patients with  KIT exon 11 \ndeletions (but not KIT  exon 11 insertion or point mutation,  KIT exon 9 \nmutation,  PDGFRA  mutation, or wild -type tumor). Tumor genotype was \nnot associated with RFS in the placebo arm.  \nAn intergroup randomized trial (EORTC -62024: NCT00103168) compared \nobservation with 2 years of adjuvant imatinib following R0/R1 resection in \n908 patients with localized, intermediate, or high- risk GIST.  55 RFS for \nimatinib versus observation was 84% versus 66% at 3 years and 69% \nversus 63% at 5 years ( P < .001). However, the endpoint of 5- year \nimatinib failure -free survival (IFFS) did not reach significance at 87% \nversus 84% (HR, 0.79; 98.5% CI, 0.50– 1.25; P = .21).   \nThe results of another randomized phase III study from the Scandinavian \nSarcoma Group (SSG XVIII/AIO) suggest that a longer duration of postoperative imatinib improves RFS and OS for patients with a high estimated risk of recurrence after surgery.\n56,57 In this study, patients with a \nhigh risk for GIST recurrence after surgery were randomized to 12 months \n(n = 200) or 36 months (n = 200) of postoperative imatinib. After a median \nfollow- up of 90 months, RFS and OS were significantly longer in the \n36-month  group compared to the 12- month group (5 -year RFS: 71.1% vs. \n52.3%, respectively; P < .001; 5- year OS: 91.9 % vs. 85.3% respectively; \nP = .036). The highest risk for recurrence was observed among patients \nwith non- gastric GIST and tumors with high mitotic count.58  \nManagement of Toxicities  \nThe most common side effects of imatinib include fluid retention, diarrhea, \nnausea, fatigue, muscle cramps, abdominal pain, and rash. The side effect \nprofile may improve with prolonged therapy.59 Serious side effects (such \nas liver function test [LFT] abnormalities, lung toxicity, low blood counts, \nand GI bleeding) have rarely been reported and often improve after \nimatinib has been withheld. LFT abnormalities are seen in fewer than 5% \nof patients.  Leukopenia is quite rare and imatinib has only rarely been \nassociated with neutropenic fever. In a retrospective analysis of 219 \nconsecutive patients treated with imatinib, grade 3 or 4 cardiotoxicity \noccurred in 8.2% of patients who were manageable with medical therapy, \nand infrequently required dose reduction or discontinuation of imatinib.60 \nThe side effect profile may improve with prolonged therapy and can be \nmanaged with appropriate supportive care measures. If life -threatening \nside effects occur with imatinib that cannot be managed by maximum \nsupportive treatment, then sunitinib should be considered after \ndiscontinuing imatinib.  \nSunitinib  \nSunitinib is a multitargeted TKI that can induce objective responses and \ncontrol progressive disease in patients with imatinib- resistant GIST. SDH -\ndeficient GIST may have a higher probability of response to sunitinib.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors  \nMS-9 In a randomized, phase III, placebo- controlled study, sunitinib produced \nsignificant, sustained clinical benefit in patients with imatinib- resistant or \nimatinib -intolerant GIST.61 In patients with imatinib -resistant GIST, \nsunitinib resulted in a significant improvement in median time to \nprogression (27.3 vs. 6.4 weeks) and significantly greater estimated OS. \nSunitinib treatment induced PR in 14 patients (6.8%) and stable disease \n(≥22 weeks) in 36 patients (17.4%) versus no PRs and stable disease in 2 \npatients (1.9%) on placebo. In the imatinib- intolerant group, 4 out of 9 \npatients randomized to sunitinib achieved PR and one patient had \nprogressive disease. In contrast, 3 of the 4 patients randomized to placebo \nhad progressive disease at the time of analysis and no PR was observed. \nSunitinib was generally well tolerated. In January 2006, sunitinib received \nFDA approval for the treatment of GIST after disease progression on or \nintolerance to imatinib.  \nThe safety and efficacy of sunitinib on a continuous daily dosing schedule at 37.5 mg was evaluated in an open -label, multicenter, randomized phase \nII study\n in patients with advanced GIST after imatinib failure.62 Patients \nwere randomized (1:1) to receive continuous daily sunitinib (37.5 mg/d) either in the morning or in the evening for 28 days (one cycle). The \nprimary endpoint was the clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as the \npercentage of patients with CRs, PRs,  or stable disease for 24 weeks or \nmore based on RECIST criteria. The overall CBR was 53% (13% of patients had a PR and 40% had stable disease). Median PFS and OS \nwere 34 weeks and 107 weeks, respectively. The most commonly \nreported treatment -related adverse events (diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea) \nwere consistent with those known to be associated with sunitinib intermittent dosing. Treatment -related hypertension and hypothyroidism \n(experienced by 28% and 12% of patients, respectively) were successfully managed with appropriate supportive care measures. Both of these \nadverse events have also been associated with the long- term use of \nsunitinib on intermittent dosing. The results of this study suggest that continuous daily dosing appears to be an effective alternative dosing \nstrategy with acceptable safety for patients with \nimatinib -resistant/ -intolerant GIST.  \nResults were recently reported from an international study of sunitinib safety and efficacy in patients with imatinib- resistant/ -intolerant advanced \nGIST (n = 1124).63 The median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 8.0–9.4 \nmonths) and the median OS was 16.6 months (95% CI, 14.9– 18.0 \nmonths); safety findings were in line with previous studies. In a follow -up \nretrospective analysis of a subset of this trial population (n = 230), P FS \nwas significantly better for patients with a primary mutation in KIT  exon 9 \ncompared to those with a primary mutation in exon 11 (12.3 months vs. 7 \nmonths; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39– 0.89; P = .011).64 \nManagement of Toxicities  \nSunitinib -related toxicities can often be managed with dose interruptions or \nreductions. Fatigue, nausea, and vomiting were dose- limiting toxicities for \nsunitinib in clinical trials. Other common toxicities include hematologic toxicities (ie, anemia, neutropenia), diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucositis, \nanorexia, and skin discoloration. Sunitinib is associated with a significant \nrisk of developing hand -foot skin reaction (HFSR).\n65 Early detection and \nproper management of HFSR is vital during treatment with sunitinib. HFSR can be prevented with routine application of emollient lotions. If it is \nsignificant, interruption of therapy is indicated; if it is severe, dose \nreduction should be considered.  \nHypertension is a common side effect reported in clinical trials, since \nsunitinib targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). \nHowever, the risk is higher in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) \ncompared to those with non- RCC.\n66 Recent reports have shown that \nsunitinib is also associated with cardiotoxicity and hypothyroidism.67,68 In a \nretrospective analysis of the data from phase I -II studies, 11% of patients \nhad an adverse cardiovascular event including CHF in 8% of patients and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:09 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors  \nMS-11 Impact of Mutational Status on Tumor Response to First -Line \nTyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Patients with Advanced or Metastatic \nGIST  \nGIST are generally more resistant to traditional systemic \nchemotherapeutic agents  and radiation therapy  (RT) than other STS \nsubtypes; therefore, treatment options for patients with advanced or \nmetastatic GIST were historically limited.69 The discovery that many \nGIST are driven by constitutively activated KIT or PDGFRA receptor \ntyrosine kinases was a significant breakthrough, enabling GIST to be \nmanaged  with targeted therapies. TKIs have now emerged as the \nstandard- of-care treatment  for patients with advanced or metastatic GIST \n(GIST -4 and GIST -D 1 of 2 ). Imatinib, the first TKI approved for the \ntreatment of patients with GIST, is clinically active against many GIST in \nthe first -line setting.44,70 However, not all GIST are responsive to imatinib, \nas tumor response is primarily dependent on tumor mutational status.  \nGIST with KIT or PDGFRA Mutations  \nImatinib -Sensitive Mutations  \nUp to ~ 80% of GIST have a KIT mutation, while 5% –10% have a \nPDGFRA mutation.15,71- 73 The presence and type of KIT or PDGFRA  \nmutations are not strongly correlated with prognosis. However, the \npresence (or absence) of mutations in specific regions of KIT and \nPDGFRA  genes are associated with a response to specific TKIs.   \nIn randomized trials evaluating imatinib  in the advanced disease setting , \nthe presence of a KIT exon 11 mutation was associated with better \nresponse rates, median progression- free survival ( PFS), and median \noverall survival ( OS) than KIT exon 9 mutations or non-mutated KIT or \nPDGFRA .27,70,73- 75 Long- term follow- up (median 73 months) from the \nrandomized, phase III BFR14 trial by the French Sarcoma Group \nidentified KIT exon 11 mutations as an independent prognostic factor for \nlonger  PFS and OS in patients treated with standard -dose imatinib when compared with  KIT exon 9 mutations  or non -mutated  KIT.27 In the \nUS-Finnish B2222 phase II study, imatinib was associated with better \noutcomes for patients with KIT exon 11 mutations than those with KIT \nexon 9 mutations or who had no detectable kinase mutations.70 The \npartial response ( PR) rates for patients with KIT exon 11 mutations, KIT \nexon 9 mutations, or no detectable kinase mutations were 83.5%, 47. 8%, \nand 0%, respectively. The presence of KIT exon 11 mutations was the \nstrongest prognostic factor reducing the risk of death by more than 95%.  \nGIST with KIT exon 9 mutations treated with imatinib generally have a \nlower response rate and PFS than those with KIT exon 11 tumors at a \ndose of 400 mg daily, but imatinib 400 mg two times a day (BID)  may \nlead to a better response and PFS . In the  randomized EORTC 62005 \nstudy, the presence of KIT exon 9 mutations was the strongest  adverse \nprognostic factor for risk of progression and death.73 High-dose imatinib \n(400 mg BID ) resulted in a significantly superior PFS with a reduction in \nthe relative risk of 61% ( P = .0013) in patients whose tumors expressed \na KIT exon 9 mutation compared with the standard 400 mg/day  imatinib \ndose.73 Additionally, the response rate after crossover from 400 mg daily \nto 400 mg BID  imatinib was higher  in patients with KIT exon 9 mutations \n(57%) than patients with KIT exon 11 mutations (7%).  Similarly, results \nfrom the phase III SWOG S0033/CALGB 150105 trial showed that imatinib  at 400 mg BID  resulted in a higher response rate in patients with \na KIT exon 9 mutation than those with imatinib at 400 mg once daily  \n(67% vs. 17%, respectively).\n75 A meta- analysis of EORTC 62005 and \nSWOG S0033/CALGB 150105 trials that randomized 1640 patients with advanced GIST to standard -dose imatinib (400 mg daily) or high -dose \nimatinib ( 400 mg BID ) showed a benefit in PFS for patients with KIT exon \n9 mutations treated with high- dose imatinib.\n76  \nWhile most GIST with PDGFRA  mutations are associated with a \nresponse to imatinib, those with certain mutations, such as D842V , PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:09 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors  \nMS-12 generally do not  respond.11,15 In a survey of patients with confirmed \nPDGFRA  mutations, none of 31 evaluable patients with a D842V  \nmutation had a response to imatinib, and 21 of 31 (68%) experienced  \ndisease progression.77 The median PFS was 2.8 months for patients with \nD842V  compared with 28.5 months for patients with other PDGFRA  \nmutations  (eg, indels in exon 18) . With 46 months of follow -up, the \nmedian OS was 14.7 months for patients with D842V  and not reached for \npatients with other PDGFRA  mutations.  \nImatinib is included in the guidelines as a category 1 preferred  first-line \ntreatment option for patients with advanced or metastatic GIST with \nimatinib -sensitive  mutations ; however, it is not recommended for the \ntreatment of GIST with PDGFRA exon 18 mutations that are insensitive \nto imatinib, especially D842V  (GIST -4 and GIST- D 1 of 2) .  \nIn the adjuvant setting, a  longer duration of imatinib treatment may be \nbeneficial for patients with GIST that have  certain KIT mutations.  Follow -\nup analysis of a randomized phase III study from the Scandinavian \nSarcoma Group (SSG XVIII/AIO) revealed that patients with GIST \nharboring a KIT exon 11 deletion appear to benefit most from longer -\nduration imatinib, showing higher recurrence -free survival ( RFS) when \nallocated to the 3- year versus 1 -year imatinib group.78 A similar pattern \nrelated to duration of treatment was not observed for GIST harboring other mutations.   \nImatinib -Insensitive Mutations  \nGIST with imatinib -insensitive mutations such as PDGFRA D842V are \nmanaged differently than most GIST. Avapritinib is a TKI approved for \nthe treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST with a \nPDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including D842V mutations.\n79,80 The \napproval of avapritinib for GIST was based on results from the open-\nlabel, single -arm phase I NAVIGATOR trial that evaluated the safety and \nantitumor activity of avapritinib in 56 patients with PDGFRA D842V -containing GIST that were unresectable and/or metastatic .81,82 In the \nlong- term analysis of the trial, a t data cut -off (median follow -up of 27.5 \nmonths), the overall response rate (ORR) with avapritinib was 91%, with \na median duration of response (DOR) of 27.6 months.82  \nGiven these data, the panel recommends avapritinib as the preferred first-line treatment option for patients with unresectable, progressive, or  \nmetastatic GIST with imatinib -resistant  PDGFRA  D842V mutations or \nother PDGFRA exon 18 mutations  that are known to be imatinib -\ninsensitive (GIST -4 and GIST- D 1 of 2).   \nGIST Without KIT or PDGFRA Mutations  \nApproximately 10 %–15% of GIST lack a mutation in either KIT or \nPDGFRA .16,71 Most of these have functional inactivation of the succinate \ndehydrogenase ( SDH ) complex (either from mutations or epigenetic \nsilencing leading to a lack of SDH protein expression),16 which has been \nshown to be a cause  of tumorigenesis.  GIST with SDH deficiency \ngenerally lack the gain- of-function tyrosine kinase mutations found in the \nmajority of GIST;83 therefore, certain TKIs (specifically imatinib) have \nlimited efficacy in this setting.84  \nHowever, TKIs with activity against vascular endothelial growth factor \nreceptor (VEGFR) can be considered as potential options for SDH -\ndeficient GIST. Data from two small retrospective studies suggested that \nsunitinib may be active in SDH- deficient GIST.85,86 Although sunitinib \ntargets KIT and PDGFRA, it is also active against other kinases, \nincluding VEGFR.87 Regorafenib is another TKI with activity against \nVEGFR , and was reported to be clinically active  against SDH -deficient \nGIST in a small number of patients.88,89 In a phase II study, p rolonged \ndisease control was achieved  in one patient with SDH- deficient GIST \ntreated with pazopanib, another TKI that targets VEGFR .90,91 Based on \nthese limited data, the guidelines recommend consideration of  sunitinib, \nregorafenib, and pazopanib as options  for unresectable SDH -deficient PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:09 PM.

There are other  potential \ntreatments  on the horizon for patients with SDH -deficient GIST ; for \nexample, temozolomide  has shown promise in this setting based on \npreclinical data,92 and is currently undergoing clinical testing \n(NCT03556384) .  \nGIST with NTRK  fusions in the absence of KIT/PDGFRA  mutations may \noccur.93-95 NTRK  fusion is an actionable alteration, as both larotrectinib \nand entrectinib were granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration ( FDA) for the treatment of solid tumors with NTRK  \ngene fusions .96,97 In a combined analysis of three studies, larotrectinib \nresulted in an ORR  of 75% (based on independent review) in children \nand adults with locally advanced or metastatic NTRK  fusion -positive solid \ntumors, including GIST.98 An integrated analysis of three trials found that \nentrectinib led to an objective response in 57% of adults with locally \nadvanced or metastatic NTRK  fusion -positive solid tumors.99 The \nguidelines recommend larotrectinib and entrectinib as preferred first -line \ntreatment options for patients with unresectable, progressive , or \nmetastatic GIST that are NTRK -fusion positive (GIST -D 1 of 2).  \nOther genomic events, such as alterations in BRAF, NF1 , and FGFR,  \nmay also occur in GIST.21,95,100- 104 The guidelines do not recommend \nspecific therapies for GIST with these alterations; however, the presence \nof these genomic events could be used to identify potential targeted \ntherapy options. For example, combination therapy with dabrafenib and \ntrametinib was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors with BRAF V600E mutations.\n105  \nManagement of Resistance to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors  \nResistance to Imatinib  \nWhile imatinib improves outcomes for patients with advanced or \nmetastatic GIST, many will develop resistance to the drug. Primary imatinib resistance is defined as the evidence of clinical progression \ndeveloping during the first 6 months of imatinib therapy ; this  is most \ncommonly seen in patients with KIT exon 9 mutations treated with \nimatinib at 400 mg daily, PDGFRA  D842V  mutations, or those with \ntumors that lack identifiable activating mutations in KIT or PDGFRA,  the \nmajority of which are SDH -deficient GIST , thus underscoring the \nimportance of genotyping GIST .70,74,75,106 Secondary resistance is seen in \npatients who have been on imatinib for more than 6 months with an initial \nresponse or disease stabilization followed by progression, most \ncommonly because of the outgrowth of tumor clones with secondary \nmutations in KIT.107- 110  \nFor GIST with limited progression following the standard imatinib dose \nregimen, several options are available (GIST -5). The same dose of \nimatinib can be continued, while also considering resection (if feasible), \nablation procedures/embolization/chemoembolization, or palliative RT \n(category 2B) for symptomatic lesions. The TKI can also be switched to \nsunitinib (category 1) ; alternatively, dose escalation of imatinib  to 800 \nmg/d ay (400 mg BID) is another option.40,61,62 Data have suggested that \ncertain patients with GIST, particularly those with KIT exon 9 mutations, \nmay derive benefit from imatinib dose escalation .76,111 For patients with \nperformance status  (PS) 0–2 and generalized disease progression \nfollowing treatment with imatinib 400 mg/day , the guidelines recommend \nswitching to an alternate TKI or escalating the dose of imatinib, as \ntolerated (GIST- 5 and GIST -D 1 of 2).  \nThe approval of sunitinib for the treatment of patients with imatinib -\nrefractory or intolerant GIST was primarily based on a phase III \nrandomized controlled study in 312 patients with advanced GIST that were resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib treatment.\n61,112 The median \ntime to tumor progression was 27.3 weeks in the sunitinib group versus 6.4 weeks in the placebo group ( hazard ratio [ HR] 0.33; P < .0001).

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors  \nMS-14 The clinical activity of sunitinib in imatinib -resistant GIST can vary \ndepending on the presence of primary and secondary KIT mutations. \nOne study found that second -line sunitinib induced higher clinical benefit \n(PR or stable disease for ≥6 months) in patients with imatinib -\nresistant/intolerant GIST with primary KIT exon 9 mutations than those \nwith KIT exon 11 mutations (58% vs. 34%, respectively).106 Median PFS \nand OS were significantly longer for patients with KIT exon 9 mutations \nor non-mutated KIT than those with KIT exon 11 mutations. In patients \nwith KIT exon 11 mutations, median PFS and OS were longer for those \nwith secondary exon 13 or 14 mutations compared to those with exon 17 \nor 18 mutations. Although sunitinib appears to have activity against \ntumors with KIT adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -binding pocket mutations  \n(exons 13 and 14)  that confer resistance to imatinib, it has little activity \nagainst tumors with imatinib -resistant mutations in the KIT activation loop \n(exons 17 and 18) .113- 115  \nBased on these data, sunitinib (category 1)  is recommended as a \npreferred second -line option for  patients with unresectable, progressive, \nor metastatic GIST previously treated with imatinib (GIST -D 1 of 2).   \nFor patients with a PDGFRA D842V mutation or other PDGFRA  exon 18 \nmutations that are insensitive to imatinib, the guidelines recommend \ndasatinib as a second- line option. The clinical evidence supporting use of \ndasatinib as a second- line therapy is described in more detail in the \nResistance to Avapritinib section.  \nResistance to Imatinib and Sunitinib  \nRegorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with activity against KIT, PDGFR, \nVEGFR, and others, can be considered f or patients with locally \nadvanced, unresectable, or metastatic GIST previously treated with \nimatinib and sunitinib.88 The FDA approval of regorafenib in this setting \nwas based on results from t he phase III randomized GRID trial, where \nregorafenib versus placebo was evaluated in 199 patients with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST that progressed  on prior therapy \nwith imatinib and sunitinib.116 The median PFS (4.8 months vs. 0.9 \nmonths; P < .0001) and the disease control rate (DCR; 53% vs. 9%) \nwere significantly higher for regorafenib than placebo. The PFS rates at 3 and 6 months were 60% and 38%, respectively, for regorafenib \ncompared to 11% and 0%, respectively, for placebo. The HR for OS was \n0.77 with 85% of patients in the placebo arm crossing over to regorafenib due to disease progression. Long -term follow- up (median 41 months) \nfrom a phase II study in unresectable or metastatic GIST (n = 33 ) \nsuggested that patients with KIT exon 11 mutations or SDH- deficient \nGIST may derive a greater PFS benefit from regorafenib than KIT/PDGFRA  wild-type, non- SDH– deficient tumors.\n89 Given these data, \nregorafenib  (category 1)  is included in the guidelines on GIST -D 1 of 2 as \na preferred third- line option following imatinib and sunitinib.  \nResistance to Imatinib, Sunitinib, and Regorafenib  \nRipretinib, a TKI that inhibit s KIT and PDGFRA kinases,  is approved by \nthe FDA for adults with advanced GIST who have received prior \ntreatment with 3 or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib.117 In the \nphase III INVICTUS trial, ripretinib 150 mg daily was evaluated against \nplacebo in patients with advanced GIST who were previously treated \nwith imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib.118 The median PFS of the \nripretinib group was 6.3 months, compared with 1.0 months in the \nplacebo group ( P < .0001).

The median PFS  after \nreceiving the first dose of 150 mg BID was 3.7 months.  The guidelines \ninclude dose escalation of ripretinib to 150 mg BID as an option for \npatients who experience disease progression while on ripretinib 150 mg daily (GIST -D 1 of 2).  \nResistance to Imatinib, Sunitinib, Regorafenib, and Ripretinib  \nOther TKIs are recommended in the guidelines as off -label options after \ndisease progression on approved therapies (GIST -D 1 of 2). Much of the \ndata on these TKIs are derived from phase II studies and retrospective \nanalyses involving a small number of patients.  Additionally, many of \nthese studies only included patients previously treated with imatinib and \nsunitinib, but not regorafenib and/or ripretinib.  \nA few studies have evaluated sorafenib as an option for some patients \nwith advanced or metastatic GIST .120- 123 In a prospective, multicenter, \nphase II study of 38 patients with unresectable, KIT-positive  GIST that \nhad progressed on imatinib and sunitinib, sorafenib resulted in a DCR of 68% (55% had stable disease and 13% had PR).\n120 Median PFS and OS \nwere 5.2 months and 11.6 months, respectively. In a retrospective \nanalysis of 124 patients with metastatic GIST resistant to imatinib and \nsunitinib, the median PFS and OS of patients who received sorafenib \nwas 6.4 months and 13.5 months,  respectively.122  \nAnother TKI  that can be considered is nilotinib .124- 128 In a retrospective \nanalysis of 52 patients with advanced imatinib - and sunitinib -resistant \nGIST, nilotinib resulted in a 10% response rate and 37% DCR.125 Median \nPFS and OS were 12 weeks and 34 weeks, respectively. In a \nrandomized phase III study of nilotinib as third -line therapy in patients \nwith GIST resistant or intolerant to imatinib and sunitinib (248 patients), the PFS on nilotinib was not superior to  best supportive care (109 days \nvs. 111 days; P = .56).\n127 In a post hoc analysis, nilotinib led to an improved OS (>4 months) compared with best supportive care (405 days \nvs. 280 days; P = .02) in patients whose disease  progressed on both \nimatinib and sunitinib. This clinical benefit may be specific to patients \nwith secondary KIT exon 17 mutations.128 In a phase III trial that \nevaluated nilotinib versus imatinib in the first -line setting, none of the \npatients with KIT exon 9 mutations treated with nilotinib achieved an \nobjective response. Additionally, nilotinib resulted in a shorter PFS than \nimatinib in those with KIT exon 9 mutations, suggesting that nilotinib is \nnot effective for this mutation type.129 \nPazopanib also has  modest activity in unselected, heavily pretreated \npatients with advanced GIST.90,130 In a randomized, phase II trial \ncomparing pazopanib to best supportive care in imatinib-  and sunitinib -\nresistant GIST (n = 81), median PFS was 3.4 months versus 2.3 months, \nrespectively (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37– 0.96; P = .03).130  \nCabozantinib  is another TKI that may be considered for patients whose \ndisease has progressed on approved therapies.131 Everolimus in \ncombination with a TKI (ie, imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib) may also be \nactive in imatinib -resistant GIST.132 \nFor a complete list of additional options for GIST that have progressed \non approved therapies, please see GIST -D 1 of 2.  \nResistance to Avapritinib  \nFor GIST that become avapritinib- resistant , several options are \nrecommended (GIST -5). For limited disease progression, avapritinib  \ntreatment  can be continued while also considering additional options, \nsuch as resection (if feasible), ablation procedures , embolization , \nchemoembolization, or palliative RT (category 2B) for symptomatic \nlesions.

Therefore, the guidelines \nrecommend dasatinib as a  preferred  second -line therapy option for \npatients with PDGFRA exon 18 mutations (including D842V) whose \ndisease has become resistant to either avapritinib or imatinib (GIST -D 1 \nof 2).  \nRipretinib is another TKI that exhibits broad activity against both KIT and \nPDGFRA (including D842V) in the preclinical setting;136 however, \nadditional clinical trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of ripretinib \nagainst GIST with PDGFRA  D842V mutations.

Genotyping is \nrecommended for cases in which medical therapy is anticipated. For very \nsmall GIST (<2 cm), abdominal/pelvic C T and/or MRI is sufficient. For all \nother GIST, workup includes baseline abdominal/pelvic CT and/or abdominal/pelvic MRI, along with chest imaging using CT or x -ray. \nPET/CT can be considered. Baseline PET/CT should be performed if PET/CT will be used during follow -up. \nTreatment Guidelines \nResectable Disease  \nPrimary/Preoperative Treatment  \nSurgery is the primary treatment for all patients with GIST (2 cm or greater)  that are resectable without significant risk of morbidity. \nPreoperative imatinib may be beneficial as primary treatment for patients \nwith GIST  that is resectable with negative margins but with a significant \nrisk of morbidity.\n45,47 The use of preoperative imatinib may, however, \nprohibit the accurate assessment of recurrence risk. Preoperative imatinib \nshould be considered only if surgical morbidity could be reduced by \ndownstaging the tumor prior to resection. Close monitoring is ess ential \nbecause some patients may rapidly become unresectable. In prospective studies, preoperative imatinib has been tested at a daily dose of either 400 \nmg\n47,48 or 600 mg.45,46 The guidelines recommend an initial dose of 400 \nmg daily. Patients with documented KIT  exon 9 mutations may benefit \nfrom dose escalation up to 800 mg daily (given as 400 mg twice daily), as \ntolerated.  Baseline imaging is recommended prior to the start of preoperative \nimatinib. To assess response to TKI therapy, abdominal/pelvic CT or MRI \nis indicated every 8 to 12 weeks. PET may give an indication of imatinib \nactivity after 2 to 4 weeks if rapid read- out is necessary. Since the optimal \nduration of preoperative therapy remains unknown, in patients with disease that is responding to therapy, imatinib should be continued until \nmaximal response ( defined as no further improvement between 2 \nsuccessive CT scans , which can take as long as 6– 12 months). However, \nit is not always necessary to wait for a maximal response to perform \nsurgery. Surgery is recommended if bleeding and/or symptoms are \npresent. For patients with disease that is responding to treatment, \nresponse assessment imaging can be performed less frequently. \nProgression may be determined by abdominal/pelvic CT or MRI with \nclinical interpretation, relying on PET/CT as needed to clarify ambiguous \nresults. Assess medication adherence before determining that therapy \nwas ineffective. If there is no progression, continuation of the same dose \nof imatinib is recommended and resection should be considered, if \npossible. If there is progression, surgery is recommended after \ndiscontinuing imatinib. In patients taking preoperative imatinib, dosing can \nbe stopped right before surgery and resumed as soon as the patient is \nable to tolerate oral medications following surgery, regardless of surgical \nmargins. Collaboration between the medical oncologist and the surgeon is \nnecessary to determine the appropriateness of surgery following major \nresponse or stable disease.  \nHowever, the management of incidentally encountered small GIST less \nthan 2 cm remains controversial.\n7 At present, there are insufficient data to \nguide the management of very small GIST (less than 2 cm) discovered incidentally on endoscopy, and the usefulness of regular EUS surveillance \nhas not been established. Complete surgical resection is the mainstay of \ntreatment in symptomatic patients. For a subset of patients with very small \ngastric GIST (less than 2 cm) with no high -risk EUS features (ie, irregular PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:09 PM.

In \nthe ACOSOG Z9001 study, risk stratification was based only on tumor size \nand postoperative imatinib improved R FS in patients with GIST 3 cm or \nlarger; however, it was statistically significant in patients with intermediate (6 cm or greater and less than 10 cm) and high risk (greater than 10 cm) \nof recurrence.\n53,54 In the SSGXVIII/AIO study, risk stratification was based \non tumor size, site, mitotic count, and rupture; survival benefit was seen in \npatients with high risk of recurrence (mitotic index of >5 mitoses/50 HPF, \nsize >5 cm, non -gastric location, and tumor r upture).56 Risk stratification \nafter surgical resection should be based on tumor mitotic rate, size, and \nlocation.140 Gold and colleagues have developed a nomogram, taking into \naccount tumor size, site, and mitotic index, to predict RFS after resection of localized primary GIST.\n141 This nomogram accurately predicts RFS after \nresection of localized primary GIST and might be useful for patient care, interpretation of study results, and selection of patients for postoperative \nimatinib therapy.  \nFor patients with complete resection following preoperative imatinib, the \npanel agreed that continuation of imatinib (at the same dose that induced objective response) is warranted. The panel acknowledged that while data \nfrom single and multicenter studies support the continuation of \npostoperative imatinib for 2 years following surgery, the exact duration of \npostoperative imatinib in this group of pat ients has not been studied in \nrandomized studies.\n45-48 The long- term analysis of the RTOG 0132 study \nsuggested that a high percentage of patients progressed after \ndiscontinuation of 2 -year postoperative imatinib therapy.142  \nFor patients with completely resected disease who did not receive \npreoperative imatinib, postoperative imatinib is recommended for patients \nwith intermediate or high- risk disease (category 1). Observation can be \nconsidered for completely resected, low -risk disease.   \nIn patients with persistent gross disease following resection (R2 resection) \nwho received preoperative imatinib, additional resection may be \nconsidered to remove residual disease. Imatinib treatment should be \ncontinued following re -resection regardless of surgical margins until \nprogression. Postoperative imatinib should be initiated following resection \nif the patient did not receive prior imatinib therapy.   \nUnresectable, Metastatic, or Recurrent Disease \nBaseline imaging is recommended prior to initiation of treatment. Imatinib \n(category 1) is the primary treatment for patients with advanced, \nunresectable, or metastatic GIST. Imatinib has been shown to improve \nresectability and reduce surgical morbidity in patients with documented \nunresectable GI ST or in patients for whom resection would carry the risk \nof severe postoperative functional deficit.47,48 Several retrospective studies \nhave demonstrated survival benefit of cytoreductive surgery following \npreoperative imatinib in patients with advanced or metastatic GIST \nresponding to preoperative imatinib.143- 150 No definitive data exist to prove \nwhether surgical resection improves clinical outcome in addition to TKI \ntherapy for patients with resectable metastatic GIST.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nGastrointestinal Stromal Tumors  \nMS-19 studies are underway to assess whether or not resection changes \noutcome in patients with unresectable metastatic GIST responding to TKI \ntherapy.   \nProviders should consider resection if complete resection can be obtained in primary metastatic disease. To assess response to TKI therapy, \nabdominal/pelvic CT or MRI is indicated every 8 to 12 weeks. PET may \ngive an indication of imatinib activity after 2  to 4 weeks if rapid read- out is \nnecessary. If there is no progression, resection can be considered \nfollowing surgical consultation. Imatinib should be continued if resection is \nnot feasible. At this time, continuous use of imatinib is recommended for \nmetastatic GIST until progression. The patient should be maintained on \nthe same dose, and the dose of imatinib should not be increased if \npatients remain stable without objective progression of the disease. \nTermination of imatinib in patients with GIST that is  refractory to imatinib \nhas been shown to result in a flare phenomenon, which in turn indicates that even in patients with progressive disease on imatinib therapy, there \nare some tumor cells for which imatinib may still be effective.\n151 \nRecurrence following complete resection should be managed as described \nfor unresectable or metastatic disease, because recurrent disease \nrepresents locoregional metastatic or infiltrative spread of the malignancy \nand carries essentially the same prognosis as distant metastases overall.  \nProgressive Disease  \nProgression is defined as the appearance of a new lesion or an increase in tumor size and may be determined by abdominal/pelvic CT or MRI with \nclinical interpretation, using PET/CT as needed to clarify ambiguous \nresults. Medication adherence should be assessed prior to determining \nthat therapy is ineffective.  \nDose escalation of imatinib up to 800 mg daily (given as 400 mg twice \ndaily) as tolerated or switching to sunitinib (category 1) are included as options for patients with progressive disease (limited disease or widespread systemic disease in patients with good performance status) on \nstandard -dose imatinib.\n40,61,62 All clinical and radiological data, including \nlesion density on CT and patient compliance to treatment with \nstandard -dose imatinib, should be assessed prior to dose escalation of \nimatinib or switching to sunitinib.  \nFor patients with limited progressive disease on standard- dose imatinib, \nsecond -line therapy with sunitinib should be initiated only if the majority \nof disease is no longer controlled by imatinib; consideration of other \ntherapeutic interventions for progressing lesion(s) is warranted. Surgical \nresection should be considered in carefully selected patients with limited \nprogressive disease that is potentially easily resectable.143,148,152 \nHowever, incomplete resections are frequent with high complication \nrates. The guidelines have included, only for patients with limited \nprogressive disease, continuation of imatinib at the same initial dose and treatment of progressing lesions with resection, RFA, chemoembolization \n(category 2B), or palliative RT (category 2B) for rare patients with bone metastases.\n7  \nRegorafenib (category 1) is recommended for patients with disease progression on imatinib and sunitinib.\n116 Based on limited data,90,120 -\n128,130,132 -134 the guidelines have also included sorafenib, dasatinib, nilotinib, \npazopanib, and everolimus plus TKI as additional options for patients who \nare no longer receiving clinical benefit from imatinib, sunitinib, or \nregorafenib, although much of the data regarding the potential benefit of \nthese agents were collected in the pre- regorafenib era.  \nIn patients with progressive disease no longer receiving benefit from \ncurrent TKI therapy, re- introduction of previously tolerated and effective \nTKI therapy for palliation of symptoms can be considered.153,154 The \nresults of a recent randomized study demonstrated that imatinib \nrechallenge significantly improved PFS and DCR in patients with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:09 PM.

The results of a prospective, multicenter, \nrandomized phase III study ( BFR14) show that there was a significant \nincrease in the rate of progressive disease when imatinib therapy was interrupted in patients with advanced disease that was stable or \nresponding to imatinib therapy.\n155,156 A recent report from this study \nconfirmed that patients with rapid disease progression after interruption of imatinib had a poorer prognosis.\n157 More importantly, the quality of \nresponse upon reintroduction of imatinib did not reach the tumor status observed at randomization.  \nThe panel strongly recommends that TKI therapy at the prescribed daily \ndose should be continued as long as patients are receiving clinical \nbenefit (response or stable disease). The panel also feels that life -long \ncontinuation of TKI therapy for palliation of symptoms should be an \nessential component of best supportive care. However, short \ninterruptions for one to two weeks, when medically necessary, have not \nbeen shown to negatively impact disease control or other outcomes.   \nSurveillance  \nPatients with completely resected, incompletely resected, or metastatic \nGIST should have a thorough H&P every 3 to 6 months; \nabdominal/pelvic CT scan should be performed every 3 to 6 months for 3 to 5 years, then annually. Less frequent surveillance may be acceptable \nfor low -risk or very small tumors (<2 cm). Progression may be \ndetermined by CT or MRI with clinical interpretation; PET/CT can be \nconsidered to clarify ambiguous CT results.
