Total duration of imatinib therapy for at least 6 years was also predictive of successful discontinuation (Saussele \nS,\tet\tal.\tLancet\tOncol\t2018;19:747-757).\t Disease characteristics at diagnosis, blast cell and platelet count in peripheral blood, a higher Sokal risk \nscore, female gender, lower natural killer cell counts, suboptimal response or resistance to imatinib, duration of TKI therapy and DMR prior to TKI \ndiscontinuation have been identified as independent factors predictive of recurrence after TKI discontinuation. In the EURO-SKI study , only the duration \nof TKI therapy prior to discontinuation was significantly associated with the maintenance of MMR at 36 months after TKI discontinuation (Mahon FX, et \nal. J Clin Oncol 2024;42:1875-1880). Lack of MR4.0 at 36 months after discontinuation of TKI was highly predictive of subsequent loss of MMR (Richter \nJ, et al.

A prolonged washout period prior to \npregnancy, prompt consideration of holding TKI therapy (if pregnancy occurs \nwhile on TKI therapy), and close monitoring should be considered.6-10 There \nare\tno\tdata\tregarding\thow\tlong\ta\tpatient\tshould\tbe\toff\ttherapy\tbefore\ttrying\t\nto become pregnant. \n• Discontinuation of TKI therapy because of pregnancy in patients who are not \nin\tDMR\t(≤0.01%\tBCR::ABL1 IS) has only been reported in a small series of \npatients.11-14 Conception while on active TKI therapy is strongly discouraged \ndue to the risk of fetal abnormalities. There are no published guidelines \nregarding the optimal depth of molecular response that is considered “safe” \nto stop TKI therapy before attempting pregnancy, and the literature regarding \nthis consists of case reports.15\n• Prior\tto\tattempting\tpregnancy,\tpatients\tof\tchildbearing\tage\tand\ttheir\tpartners\t\nshould\tbe\tcounseled\tabout\tthe\tpotential\trisks\tand\tbenefits\tof\tdiscontinuation\t\nof TKI therapy, possible resumption of TKI therapy, and treatment options \nduring pregnancy, should the CML recur. Referral to a CML specialty center \nand consultation with a high-risk obstetrician is recommended.\n• Fertility preservation should be discussed with all patients of childbearing age \nprior\tto\tthe\tinitiation\tof\t TKI\ttherapy.\tReferral\tto\tan\tin\tvitro\tfertilization\t(IVF)\t\ncenter is recommended in coordination with the patient’s obstetrician. TKI \nshould be stopped prior to attempting oocyte retrieval, but the optimal timing \nof discontinuation is unknown. There are no data to recommend how long a \npatient\tshould\tbe\toff\ttherapy\tbefore\toocyte\tretrieval,\talthough\tusually\tat\tleast\t\n1\tmonth\toff\ttherapy\tis\trecommended.\tSperm\tbanking\tcan\talso\tbe\tperformed\t\nprior to starting TKI therapy, although there are no data regarding the quality \nof sperm in patients with untreated CML.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Treatment and Monitoring During Pregnancy  \n• As noted above, in patients assigned male at birth, TKI therapy need not be \ndiscontinued if a pregnancy is planned.  \n• In patients assigned female at birth, TKI therapy should be stopped prior \nto\tnatural\tconception,\tand\tpatients\tshould\tremain\toff\ttherapy\tduring\t\npregnancy.6-8 \n• If treatment is needed during pregnancy, it is preferable to initiate treatment \nwith interferon.16 Most of the data using interferons during pregnancy have \nbeen reported in patients with essential thrombocythemia.17,18,19  In the \nUnited States, peginterferon alfa-2a and ropeginterferon alfa-2b are available \nfor clinical use. If introduced earlier, the use of peginterferon alfa-2a can \npreserve molecular remission after discontinuation of TKI.20 There are very \nlimited data for the use of ropeginterferon alfa-2b in CML during pregnancy.19\n• TKI\ttherapy,\tparticularly\tduring\tthe\tfirst\ttrimester,\tshould\tbe\tavoided\tbecause\t\nof teratogenic risk. If TKI therapy is considered during pregnancy, the \npotential\trisks\tand\tbenefits\tmust\tbe\tcarefully\tevaluated\tin\tterms\tof\tmaternal\t\nhealth and fetal risk on an individual basis. \n• The\tPanel\trecommends\tagainst\tthe\tuse\tof\thydroxyurea\tduring\tpregnancy,\t\nespecially\tin\tthe\tfirst\ttrimester.21-23\n• Leukapheresis\tcan\tbe\tused\tfor\ta\trising\twhite\tblood\tcell\t(WBC)\tcount\tand/\nor platelet count, although there are no data that recommend at what levels \nleukapheresis and/or platelet pheresis should be initiated.24-27 \n• Low-dose aspirin or low-molecular-weight heparin can be considered for \npatients with thrombocytosis.28,29 \n• Monthly\tmonitoring\tof\tCBC\twith\tdifferential\tand\tfrequent\tmonitoring\twith\t\nqPCR\t(every\t1–3\tmo)\twould\tbe\thelpful\tto\tguide\tthe\ttiming\tfor\tinitiation\tof\t TKI\t\ntherapy.  \nBreastfeeding\n• TKI therapy can be restarted after delivery. However, patients should be \nadvised not to breastfeed while on TKI therapy, as TKIs pass into human \nbreast milk.30-33\n• Breastfeeding\twithout\t TKI\ttherapy\tmay\tbe\tsafe\twith\tmolecular\tmonitoring,\t\nbut preferably in those patients with CML who have achieved durable DMR. \nIt\tmay\tbe\tacceptable\tto\tavoid\t TKIs\tfor\tthe\tshort\tperiod\tof\tthe\tfirst\t2–5\tdays\t\nafter labor to give the child colostrum.33,34\n• Close molecular monitoring is recommended for patients who extend the \ntreatment-free period for breastfeeding.

No prior history of AP-CML or BP-CML.\n• On approved TKI therapy for at least 3 years.a,b\n• Prior evidence of quantifiable BCR::ABL1  transcript.\n• Stable molecular response (MR4; BCR::ABL1 ≤0.01% IS) for ≥2 years, as documented on at least 4 tests, performed at least 3 months apart.b\n• Access to a reliable qPCR test with a sensitivity of detection of at least MR4.5 ( BCR::ABL1  ≤0.0032% IS) and that provides results within 2 \nweeks. \n• Molecular monitoring every 1–2 months for the first 6 months following discontinuation, bimonthly during months 7–12, and quarterly \nthereafter (indefinitely) for patients who remain in MMR (MR3; BCR::ABL1  ≤0.1% IS).\n• Prompt resumption of TKI within 4 weeks of a loss of MMR with monthly molecular monitoring until MMR is re-established, then every 3 \nmonths thereafter is recommended indefinitely for patients who have reinitiated TKI therapy after a loss of MMR. If MMR is not achieved after \n3 months of TKI resumption, BCR::ABL1  kinase domain mutation testing should be performed, and monthly molecular monitoring should be \ncontinued for another 6 months.General Considerations\n• Discontinuation of TKI therapy appears to be safe in select patients with CML.\n• Consult with a CML specialist to review the appropriateness for TKI discontinuation and potential risks and benefits of treatment \ndiscontinuation, including TKI withdrawal syndrome.\n• Clinical studies that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of TKI discontinuation have used strict eligibility criteria and have mandated \nmore frequent molecular monitoring than typically recommended for patients on TKI therapy.\n• Some patients have experienced significant adverse events that are believed to be due to TKI discontinuation.\n• Discontinuation of TKI therapy should only be performed in patients who give consent after a thorough discussion of the potential risks and \nbenefits.\n• Consultation with an NCCN Panel Member or center of expertise is recommended in the following circumstances:\n\u0017Any significant adverse event believed to be related to treatment discontinuation.\n\u0017There is progression to AP-CML or BP-CML at any time.\n\u0017MMR is not regained after 3 months following treatment reinitiation.\n• Outside of a clinical trial, discontinuation of TKI therapy should be considered only if all of the criteria included in the list below are met.\na The feasibility of TFR following discontinuation of TKIs other than dasatinib, imatinib, or nilotinib has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-2 Overview  \nChronic myeloid leukemia (CML) accounts for 15% of adult leukemias. \nThe median age of disease onset is 67 years; however, CML occurs in all \nage groups (SEER statistics). In 2025 , an estimated 9560 people will be \ndiagnosed with CML in the United States, and 1290 people will die from \nthe disease.1 \nCML is defined by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) in a patient with a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Ph results from a \nreciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22] that gives \nrise to a BCR::ABL1  fusion gene.\n2 In most patients, the chromosomal \nbreakpoints are located in intron 13 or 14 of the BCR gene on \nchromosome 22 (major breakpoint cluster region; M-BCR). In the ABL1 \ngene they are located between the two alternative ABL1  exons Ib and Ia, \nor between ABL1  exons 1 and 2.3,4 Irrespective of the precise ABL1  \nbreakpoint, splicing almost invariably fuses ABL1  exon 2 with BCR exons \n13 or  14, resulting in e13a2 and e14a2 transcripts that code for a protein, \np210, with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity, which causes CML.  \nUnusual BCR::ABL1  transcripts, e1a2 encoding for p190 (involving the \nminor breakpoint cluster region; m-BCR), or e19a2 encoding for p230 \n(involving the micro breakpoint cluster region; μ -BCR ), are found \ninfrequently.3,4 p190 is usually produced in the setting of Ph -positive acute \nlymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and p230 is associated with enhanced \nneutrophil differentiation. Atypical BCR::ABL1  transcripts (eg, e13a3, \ne14a3, e6a2 ) have also been detected in about 1% to 2% of patients with \nCML. The proportion of different BCR::ABL1  transcripts and the impact of \nBCR::ABL1  transcript type on response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) \ntherapy are discussed in the section BCR::ABL1 Transcript Variants in \nCML .   \nCML occurs in three different phases (chronic, accelerated, and blast \nphase) and is usually diagnosed in the chronic phase in developed countries. Untreated chronic phase CML (CP -CML) will eventually \nprogress to accelerated phase CML (AP -CML) or blast phase CML (BP -\nCML) in 3 to 5 years on average.5 Progression to AP -CML and BP -CML \nbridges a continuum of clinical features (ie, fever, bone pain, spleen size), \ncytogenetic changes, and blast count. Gene expression profiling has \nshown a close correlation of gene expression between AP- CML and BP -\nCML  indicating that the bulk of the genetic changes in progression occur in \nthe transition from CP -CML to AP -CML.6 The activation of the beta- catenin \nsignaling pathway in CML granulocyte- macrophage progenitors (which \nenhances the self -renewal activity and leukemic potential of these cells) \nmay be a key pathobiologic event in the evolution to BP -CML.7 \nThe NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) \nfor Chronic Myeloid Leukemia discuss the clinical management of CML in \nall three phases (chronic, accelerated, or blast phase). Evaluation for \ndiseases other than CML as outlined in the NCCN Guidelines® for \nMyeloproliferative Neoplasms  is recommended for all patients with \nBCR::ABL1 –negative MPN.  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Chronic \nMyeloid Leukemia, an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain key literature in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia since the \nlast guideline update using the following sear ch terms: chronic myeloid \nleukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia. The PubMed database was \nchosen as it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature \nand indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.8  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-3 The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nRandomized Controlled Trial; Clinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase \nIII; Guideline; Meta- Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles selected by the Panel for review during \nthe Guidelines update meeting as well as articles from additional sources \ndeemed as relevant to these Guidelines have been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high- level \nevidence is lacking are based on the Panel’s review of lower -level \nevidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN \nGuidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inc lusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the inform ation is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \n Diagnosis and Workup  \nInitial evaluation should consist of a history and physical exam, including \npalpation of the spleen, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, \nchemistry profile, and hepatitis B panel. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy \nfor morphologic and cytogenetic evaluation and quantitative reverse \ntranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) to establish the \npresence of quantifiable BCR::ABL1  mRNA transcripts at baseline are \nrecommended to confirm the diagnosis of CML (CML -1).  \nBone marrow cytogenetics with a minimum of 20 metaphases is useful to \ndetect additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs) in Ph- positive cells, \nalso known as clonal cytogenetic evolution (discussed below).9-13 If bone \nmarrow evaluation is not feasible, fluorescence in situ hybridization \n(FISH) on the bone marrow or a peripheral blood specimen with dual \nprobes for BCR and ABL1  genes can be used to confirm the diagnosis of \nCML. Interphase FISH is performed on peripheral blood but can be \nassociated with a false -positive rate of 1% to 5% depending on the \nspecific probe used in the assay.14 Hypermetaphase FISH is more \nsensitive and can analyze up to 500 metaphases at a time, but it is applicable only to dividing cells in the bone marrow.\n15 Double -fusion \nFISH (D-FISH) is associated with low false -positive rates and can detect \nall variant translocations of the Ph -chromosome.16  \nQuantitative RT -PCR (qPCR) should be done at  initial workup to establish \nthe presence of quantifiable BCR::ABL1  mRNA transcripts. qPCR, usually \ndone on peripheral blood, is the most sensitive assay available for the measurement of BCR::ABL1  mRNA and it can detect one CML cell in a \nbackground of ≥100,000 normal cells. qPCR results can be expressed in various ways, such as  the ratio of BCR::ABL1  transcript numbers to the \nnumber of control gene transcripts.\n17 An International Scale (IS) has \nbeen established to standardize molecular monitoring with qPCR across \ndifferent laboratories with the use of one of three control genes ( BCR, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

More details on monitoring with \nqPCR using IS are provided on MS -10. Qualitative RT -PCR or D-FISH \nshould be considered for detecting atypical BCR::ABL1  transcripts if there \nis discordance between FISH and qPCR results. See the section on \nBCR::ABL1  Transcript Variants in CML below.  \nBCR::ABL1  transcripts in the peripheral blood at very low levels (1– 10 out \nof 108 peripheral blood leukocytes) can be detected in approximately 30% \nof individuals  without CML , and the incidence of this increases with age. \nThe risk of developing CML for these individuals is extremely low, and \nneither continued monitoring nor therapy is indicated.19,20  \nBCR::ABL1  Transcript Variants in CML  \ne13a2 and e14a2 transcripts (both encoding for p210) were the most \ncommon BCR::ABL1  transcript variants identified in about 39% and 62% \nof patients, respectively; e13a2 was more frequent in males and the proportion decreased with age in both sexes.\n21,22 Unusual or atypical \ntranscripts were identified in about 2% of patients, with e1a2, e19a2, \ne13a3, and e14a3 being the most frequently identified transcripts.21 The \nincidence of these atypical transcripts was higher in females and the \nproportion decreased with age in both genders.  The presence of e14a2 \nat baseline was associated with higher molecular response rates to imatinib.\n23-29 While some studies have demonstrated a trend towards \nbetter survival outcomes with e14a2 transcript,25,26 in other studies the \ntype of transcript did not have any significant impact on long -term \nsurvival outcomes.24,27,30  \nLimited available data from studies that evaluated the impact of BCR::ABL1  transcript variants on response to second -generation (2G) \nTKI therapy suggest that nilotinib may be associated with inferior molecular response rates in patients with e13a2 as well as e14a2 transcripts compared to imatinib 800 mg or dasatinib.\n25,31 The results of \nother studies indicate that difference in the amplification characteristics \nbetween the e13a2 and e14a2 transcripts can affect the measurement of \nresidual disease, thus emphasizing the need to consider sequential \nmeasurement of minimal residual disease in addition to the achievement \nof response milestones at specific timepoints.32-34  \nThe presence of e1a2 transcript (encoding for p190) is associated with a higher risk of disease progression, inferior cytogenetic and molecular \nresponses to TKI therapy, and the presence of frequent mutations in \nepigenetic modifiers genes.\n35-41 In a multivariate analysis, the e1a2 \ntranscript was also identified as an independent predictor of inferior \nsurvival outcomes.37 It is important to be aware that these data refer to \nthe presence of dominant e1a2 transcript, not to the presence of low -\nlevel e1a2 transcripts in patients with dominant e13a2 or e14a2 \ntranscripts. The presence of e19a2 transcript (encoding for p230) is \nassociated with lower rates of cytogenetic and molecular response to \nTKIs and inferior survival outcomes, despite previous reports of  an \nindolent disease course in the pre -TKI era.38,39,42 Referral to centers with \nexpertise in the management of CML is recommended.  \nQualitative RT- PCR, nested RT -PCR, or Sanger sequencing are useful \nfor identifying atypical BCR::ABL1  transcripts.43,44 qPCR using log -\nreduction from standardized baseline can be used to monitor e1a2 \ntranscripts, and monitoring e19a2 transcripts is usually performed using \nqualitative RT -PCR or nested RT- PCR. However, there are no \nstandardized qPCR assays for monitoring molecular response to TKI therapy in patients with atypical BCR::ABL1  transcripts.\n45,46 The utility of \nmultiplex PCR assays and patient -specific genomic quantitative DNA \nPCR assays for monitoring atypical BCR::ABL1  transcripts has been \ndemonstrated in some reports.47-51  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-5 Clonal Cytogenetic Evolution  \nThe prognostic significance of ACAs in Ph -positive cells is related to the \nspecific chromosomal abnormality and other features of the accelerated \nphase.9-13 The presence of “major route” ACAs in Ph- positive cells (trisomy \n8, isochromosome 17q, second Ph, trisomy 19, and chromosome 3 abnormalities) at diagnosis may have a negative prognostic impact on \nsurvival and disease progression to accelerated or blast phase.\n52-55 \nHowever, in another analysis that evaluated the outcomes of patients with CP-CML (with or without ACAs) treated with TKI therapy in prospective \nstudies, the presence of ACAs in Ph- positive cells at the time of diagnosis \nwas not associated with worse prognosis.\n56 Survival outcomes were not \nsignificantly different among patients with ACAs in Ph- positive cells based \non TKI therapy (imatinib vs. 2G TKIs) or imatinib dose (400 vs. 800 mg). It \nremains uncertain if 2G TKIs or high- dose imatinib would be more \nbeneficial for patients with ACAs in Ph- positive cells. Patients with ACAs in \nPh-positive cells at diagnosis should be monitored carefully for evidence of \nresistance to TKI therapy  and follow- up metaphase karyotype analysis \nshould be performed if resistance is evident.  \nClonal cytogenetic evolution in Ph- negative  cells has also been reported in \na small subset of patients treated with TKI therapy.57-68 The most common \nabnormalities include trisomy 8 and loss of the Y chromosome . Previous \nwork suggested that the overall prognosis of Ph- negative clonal evolution \nis good and depends on response to imatinib therapy.61 However, the \npresence of chromosome abnormalities other than loss of the Y chromosome has been associated with decreased survival in patients with \nCP-CML treated with various TKIs, suggesting that closer follow -up is \nindicated.\n69 Progression to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute \nmyeloid leukemia (AML) has been reported in patients with monosomy 7 \n(del 7q).70-72  Additional Evaluation  \nChronic Phase CML: Risk Stratification  \nSokal and Hasford (Euro) scoring systems have been used for the risk stratification of patients into three risk groups (low, intermediate, and high) \nin clinical trials evaluating TKIs.\n73,74 The Sokal score is based on the \npatient’s age, spleen size on clinical examination, platelet count, and percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood.\n73 The Euro score includes \neosinophils and basophils in the peripheral blood in addition to the same clinical variables used in the Sokal score.\n74  \nThe European Treatment and Outcome Study long- term survival (ELTS) \nscore is based on the same variables as the Sokol score and provides the most useful predictor of CML- related death in patients treated with first -line \nimatinib.\n75 The ELTS score has been validated in a cohort of 1120 patients \nwith CP -CML treated with imatinib in six clinical trials. Older age, higher \nperipheral blasts, bigger spleen, and low platelet counts were significantly associated with increased probabilities of dying of CML. Patients in the \nintermediate- and the high- risk groups had significantly higher probabilities \nof dying of CML than those in the low -risk group, and the probabilities \nwere also significantly different between the intermediate- and high -risk \ngroups. Unlike other scoring systems, the ELTS score is focused on CML-specific overall survival (OS). This is important, as many patients with \nCML die from non -CML causes, reflecting the efficacy of TKI therapy.  \nDetermination of risk score using either the Sokal or Euro or ELTS scoring \nsystems ( CML -A) prior to initiation of TKI therapy is recommended for \npatients diagnosed with CP -CML.\n73-75 \nAdvanced Phase CML: Diagnostic Criteria  \nThe modified MD Anderson Cancer Center  (MDACC)  criteria for AP -CML \n(15% and 29% peripheral blood or bone marrow myeloblasts; ≥30% of \nperipheral blood myeloblasts and promyelocytes; ≥ 20% of peripheral PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

IBMTR criteria were used in most of the clinical trials \nleading to the approval of TKIs and is best aligned with prognostication \nsystems derived from these studies . The 2022 ICC and WHO \nclassification require the presence of ≥20% blast cells in the peripheral \nblood or bone marrow, the presence of extramedullary blast proliferation, \nand the presence of increased lymphoblasts in peripheral blood or bone \nmarrow to confirm the diagnosis of BP -CML.\n78,79  \nClinical trials  in the TKI era have almost uniformly utilized the modified \nMDACC or the IBMTR criteria . The  use of ICC or WHO criteria for the \ndiagnosis of AP- CML and BP -CML is not recommended.  \nFlow cytometry to determine cell lineage, mutational analysis, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing, if considering allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), are recommended for patients with \nadvanced phase CML.  \nMyeloid Mutational Analysis \nMutations in epigenetic modifier genes (eg, ASXL1, IKZF1, BCOR , \nTET1/2, IDH1/2, DNMT3A/3B, EZH2)  have been described in patients with \nCML and the presence of epigenetic gene mutations at diagnosis has \nbeen associated with lower rates of molecular  or cytogenetic responses \nand lower rates of progression- free survival (PFS)/event -free survival \n(EFS).81-97  \nMutations in the ASXL1 gene are the most commonly described \nsecondary alterations in patients with CP -CML and are an independent \npredictor of inferior molecular/cytogenetic responses and EFS rates following TKI therapy (including 2G -TKI therapy).\n94,95 In an analysis of 222 \npatients with CP -CML (prospectively enrolled in the CML- V study), an \nASXL1  mutation was detected in 20 patients at the time of diagnosis. All \npatients had received nilotinib- based TKI therapy. The probability of \nachieving major molecular response (MMR) or better at 12 months was significantly lower for patients with an ASXL1  mutation (55%; P  = .0036) \ncompared to 85% for patients with no mutations and 82% for patients with other non- ASXL1 mutations.\n95 However, in another study of 124 patients \nwith newly diagnosed CP- CML, mutations in epigenetic modifier genes \n(including ASXL1  mutation) were predictive of response rates only in \npatients treated with imatinib but did not have any impact on the outcomes in patients treated with 2G TKIs.\n89  \nIKZF1 exon deletions  and mutations in ASXL1, RUNX1, and BCOR genes  \nwere the most frequently described secondary alterations in advanced \nphase CML, while IDH1/2  mutations were detected at a markedly lower \nfrequency.82,87,90,92,93 IKZF1, RUNX1,  and DNMT3A alterations were \nidentified as important markers of disease progression to advanced phase \nCML and risk of relapse after discontinuation of TKI.81,83,87,96 Mutations at PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-7 diagnosis in ASXL1 , DNMT3A, JAK2 , and TET2 genes have been \nassociated with increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with \nTKI therapy.97  \nNext -generation sequencing (NGS) allows for the detection of low -level \nBCR::ABL1  kinase domain mutations and mutations in genes other than \nBCR::ABL1  that may confer resistance to TKIs or portend disease \nprogression.98,99 In a prospective, multicenter study (NEXT- in-CML) that \nassessed the feasibility of NGS to detect low -level mutations in 236 \nconsecutive patients with CML and an inadequate response to TKI \ntherapy, NGS was more effective than conventional Sanger sequencing \nin the detection of low -level mutations.99 Prospective monitoring of \nmutation kinetics demonstrated that TKI -resistant low -level mutations are \ninvariably selected if the patients are not switched to another TKI or if \nthey are switched to an inappropriate TKI or TKI dose.99 NGS with \nmyeloid mutation panel should be considered for patients with no \nidentifiable BCR::ABL1  mutations.  \nTesting for BCR::ABL1 –independent mutations using NGS with myeloid \nmutation panel may be useful for patients with CP -CML who do not \nachieve optimal response milestones due to the presence of cytopenias, \nfor those patients with TKI -resistant disease and for patients with \nadvanced phase CML.88,91 However, there are very limited data on the \nimpact of BCR::ABL1 –independent mutations in patients with newly \ndiagnosed CP -CML. Additionally, BCR::ABL1 –independent gene \nmutations have also been frequently described in Ph -negative clones.100 \nThe impact of mutations is also variable depending on whether they occur in Ph- positive or Ph -negative clones.  \nMyeloid mutational analysis using NGS can be considered for patients \nwith CP -CML and advanced phase CML at diagnosis.  Management of Chronic Phase CML  \nPrimary Treatment  \nLong- term efficacy data from randomized phase III studies for first -line \nTKI therapy in patients with newly diagnosed CP -CML are summarized in \nTable 1 .101- 105 In summary, 1) all TKIs are highly effective as primary \ntreatment for patients with newly diagnosed CP -CML, with long -term OS \nexpected to be similar to that of aged -matched controls; 2) 2G TKIs  \n(bosutinib, dasatinib , and nilotinib) and asciminib (allosteric TKI; STAMP \ninhibitor ) generally result in faster cytogenetic and molecular responses \nwith less progression to advanced phase CML  compared to imatinib; and \n3) in randomized clinical trials, as of yet, there are no significant \ndifferences in OS  between imatinib and a 2G TKI  or asciminib . \nClinical Considerations for the Selection of First -Line Therapy  \nThe selection of first -line TKI therapy (asciminib, bosutinib, dasatinib, \nimatinib, or nilotinib) in a given patient should be based on the risk score, \ntoxicity profile  and dosing schedule of TKI , patient’s age, ability to tolerate \ntherapy, and the presence of comorbid conditions , patient preference, \ntreatment goal s, and medication cost s (CML -2).  \nBCR::ABL1 Transcript Type  \nBCR::ABL1  variants lacking ABL1 exon 2 (referred to as BCR::ABL1 / b2a3 \nor BCR::ABL1 /b3a3 isoforms) are present in a minority of patients with \nCML and these isoforms confer a high degree of resistance to asciminib \n(allosteric TKI; specially targeting the ABL1 myristoyl pocket [STAMP]) \nthat cannot be overcome with higher doses of aciminib.21,106,107 Therefore, \nasciminib is contraindicated for CML with BCR::ABL1 / b2a3 or \nBCR::ABL1 /b3a3 isoforms.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-8 Risk Score   \nAsciminib, bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, or nilotinib  are all appropriate \noptions for first -line TKI therapy for patients with CP -CML across all risk \nscores.101- 105  \nDisease progression is more frequent in patients with intermediate-  or \nhigh- risk score, and prevention of disease progression to AP -CML or BP -\nCML is the primary goal of TKI therapy in patients with CP -CML. 2G TKIs  \nand asciminib are associated with a lower risk of disease progression than \nimatinib and are preferred for patients with an intermediate - or high -risk \nSokal or Euro score. 2G TKIs result in quicker molecular responses and \nhigher rates of MMR (≤0.1% BCR::ABL1 IS) and deep molecular response \n(DMR) (M R4.0 [≤0.01% BCR::ABL1 IS] or MR4.5 [≤0.0032% BCR::ABL1 \nIS]) in patients with CP -CML across all risk scores  (Table 2), which may \nfacilitate subsequent discontinuation of TKI therapy in selected \npatients .102- 104 In the ASC4FIRST study, asciminib also resulted in higher \nrates of MMR compared to  investigator -selected TKI ( imatinib or 2G \nTKIs ) in patients across all risk scores . There was a significant difference \nversus imatinib (P < .001), but there was no statistically significant \ndifference in MMR rates v ersus 2G TKI. Therefore, 2G TKIs  and \nasciminib  are preferred for patients with an intermediate- risk or high- risk \nscore.105  \n2G TKIs and asciminib  should also be considered for specific subgroups \n(based on the assessment of treatment goals and benefit/risks), for example in younger patients who are interested in ultimately discontinuing \ntreatment , particularly in young patients assigned female at birth with a \ngoal of achieving a deep and rapid molecular response which may allow \nfor eventual discontinuation of TKI therapy for family planning purposes . \nImatinib may be preferred for older patients with comorbidities, especially cardiovascular comorbidities.   Toxicity Profile  of TKI  \nAll the TKIs are generally well tolerated. Since asciminib , bosutinib, \ndasatinib, and nilotinib have very good efficacy in the  treatment of newly \ndiagnosed CP -CML , differences in their potential toxicity profiles may \ninform the selection of a specific TKI as initial therapy. Adverse events of \nfirst-line TKI therapy in patients with CP -CML reported in phase III \nrandomized studies are discussed below and are summarized in Table 3.  \nSee also the section on Special Considerations for the Use of TKI T herapy  \nin the algorithm  (CML -C).  \nAsciminib, bosutinib , or nilotinib  may be preferred for patients with a \nhistory of lung disease or deemed to be at risk of developing pleural \neffusions. Bosutinib or dasatinib may be preferred in patients with a history \nof arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease  (CVD) , hypertension, pancreatitis, \nor hyperglycemia.  \nAsciminib  \nIn the ASC4FIRST study, rash, headache, edema, muscle spasms, gastrointestinal toxicities ( diarrhea, constipation,  and vomiting), and \nbiochemical abnormalities (elevated aspartate aminotransferase  [AST] \nand alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ) were less common with asciminib \nthan with  imatinib and 2G TKIs.\n105 Headache, rash, and elevated AST/ ALT \nwere more common with 2G TKIs , whereas muscle spasms, vomiting , and \nedema were more common with imatinib. The incidences of arterial \nadverse event s were low across all 3 treatment groups occurring in 1% \nand 2% of patients treated with asciminib and 2G TKIs, respectively , with \nno such adverse event reported with imatinib. The incidence of adverse \nevents leading to discontinuation of treatment was also lower with \nasciminib.  However, longer term side effects are not evaluable because of \nthe short median follow- up of 16 months.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-9 Bosutinib  \nIn the BFORE study, diarrhea, increased ALT and AST levels were more \ncommon with bosutinib whereas muscle spasms and peripheral edema \nwere more common with imatinib.104 Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was \nhigher with bosutinib,  and grade 3/4 neutropenia was higher with imatinib. \nGrade 3/4 anemia was similar in both groups. Discontinuation of therapy \ndue to drug -related adverse events occurred in 14% of patients in the \nbosutinib group compared to 11% in the imatinib group. Increased ALT (5%) and increased AST (2%) were the most common adverse events \nleading to discontinuation of bosutinib. However, there were no \nhepatotoxicity -related fatalities during the study.  \nDasatinib  \nIn the DASISION study, the incidences of grade 3/4 hematologic \ntoxicities (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) were higher for \ndasatinib than imatinib.\n102 Nonhematologic adverse events such as \nmuscle spasms, peripheral edema, and hypophosphatemia were more \nfrequent with imatinib. Discontinuation of therapy because of drug-\nrelated adverse events occurred in 16% and 7% of patients in the \ndasatinib and imatinib arms, respectively. Dasatinib is associated with \nsignificant but reversible inhibition of platelet aggregation that may contribute to bleeding in some patients, especially if accompanied by \nthrombocytopenia.\n108 \nPleural effusion was also more common with dasatinib (28% in the \nDASISION study compared to <1% with imatinib and 33% in a dose \noptimization study) and age has been identified as a significant risk factor \nfor the development of pleural effusion.109 The occurrence of pleural \neffusion is significantly reduced with dasatinib 100 mg once daily compared with 70 mg twice daily. Patients with prior cardiac history, with \nhypertension, and receiving dasatinib 70 mg twice daily are at increased \nrisk of developing pleural effusions.\n110  Largely reversible pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been \nreported as a rare but serious side effect of dasatinib.111-113 In the \nDASISION study, pulmonary hypertension was reported in 5% of patients treated with dasatinib compared to < 1% of patients treated with imatinib.\n102  \nEvaluation for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease \nprior to initiating and close monitoring during treatment with dasatinib is \nrecommended.  Dose reduction (with close monitoring) should be \nconsidered for patients at risk of developing pleural effusions .  Switching to \nalternate TKI is recommended for persistent pleural effusion or PAH \ndespite adequate supportive care interventions and dose reduction.  \nA pH -independent formulation of dasatinib that can be administered \nconcomitantly  with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs ), or histamine 2 receptor \nantagonists (H2RAs) has been approved by the FDA as an alternative \ntreatment option for adult patients with CML. Dasatinib products are \navailable in different formulations, dosage forms , and strengths. These \nproducts are not interchangeable. Refer to package insert for full \nprescribing information: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/ . \nImatinib  \nChronic fatigue (often correlated with musculoskeletal pain and muscular \ncramps) is a major factor in reducing quality of life in patients who take \nimatinib.114 Hypophosphatemia and decrease in bone mineral density have \nbeen noted in a small group of patients, suggesting that monitoring bone \nhealth should be considered for patients taking imatinib.115,116 Skin \nhypopigmentation has also been reported as a side effect of imatinib and is reversible upon discontinuation or dose reduction.\n117,118 Reversible renal \ndysfunction with prolonged use of imatinib has also been reported.119 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

Conversely, rash and \nheadache were more common with nilotinib.103 Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia \nwas more frequently observed in the imatinib group, whereas thrombocytopenia and anemia were similar in both groups. Electrolyte \nabnormalities and elevations in lipase, glucose, and bilirubin were more \nfrequent with nilotinib than with imatinib. Patients with a previous history of \npancreatitis may be at greater risk of elevated serum lipase. The overall incidences of adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy were \ncomparable in the nilotinib 300 mg twice- daily and imatini b arms (12% and \n14%, respectively) and slightly higher in the nilotinib 400 mg twice -daily \narm (20%).  \nNilotinib labeling contains a black box warning regarding the risk of QT \ninterval prolongation, and sudden cardiac death has been reported in \npatients receiving nilotinib.\n113 Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected \nprior to initiation of treatment with nilotinib,  and electrolytes should be \nmonitored periodically. Drugs that prolong QT interval should be avoided. \nElectrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained to monitor the QT interval at \nbaseline, 7 days after initiation of nilotinib, and periodically thereafter, as \nwell as following any dose adjustments. Nilotinib is associated with an \nincreased risk of ischemic heart disease, ischemic cerebrovascular disease , and peripheral  arterial occlusive disease (PAOD).\n103 The 10 -\nyear follow -up data from  the ENESTnd study showed a higher rate of \nadverse  cardiovascular events with nilotinib (17% and 24%, respectively , \nfor nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and nilotinib 400 mg twice daily) versus imatinib (4%).\n103  \nEvaluation for pre -existing cardiovascular risk factors prior to initiating \ntreatment with nilotinib and close monitoring for any adverse  cardiovascular events during treatment with nilotinib is recommended for \nall patients. Referral to a cardiologist is recommended for patients with \ncardiovascular risk factors  for additional monitoring and/or assessments . \nQT interval prolongation could be managed with dose reduction.  \nSwitching to alternate TKI is recommended if persistent despite dose reduction and adequat e supportive care interventions.  \nNilotinib tablets with improved bioavailability that allows for administration at a lower dose without mealtime restrictions has been \napproved by the FDA.

These products are \nnot interchangeable. Refer to package insert of specific TKIs for full \nprescribing information: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov .  \nData from randomized phase III studies that have evaluated high- dose \nimatinib as first -line therapy for CP -CML suggest that imatinib 800 mg \nwas not associated with lower rates of disease progression than imatinib \n400 mg, despite improved early responses ( Table 4).120- 122 Imatinib 800 \nmg was also associated with higher rates of dose interruption, reduction, \nor discontinuation due to grade 3 or 4 adverse events in all of the \nstudies. However, patients who could tolerate the higher dose of imatinib \nachieved higher response r ates than those receiving standard- dose \nimatinib.123 Imatinib 800 mg is not recommended as initial therapy, given \nthe data showing superior efficacy of 2G TKIs in newly diagnosed CP -\nCML.

Red blood cell \ntransfusions are indicated in symptomatic patients.  Growth  factor support \ncan be used in combination with TKI therapy for the management of \npersistent cytopenias .126,127 Bone marrow evaluation should be \nconsidered to rule out disease progression to AP -CML or BP -CML or the \nemergence of other myeloid neoplasms after TKI therapy.  \nThe use of erythropoiesis -stimulating agents (ESAs) did not impact \nsurvival or cytogenetic response rate, but was associated with a higher thrombosis rate in patients with CP -CML.\n128 The guidelines from the U.S. \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the FDA do not \nsupport the use of ESAs in patients with myeloid malignancies.  Nonhematologic Toxicities  \nRecommendations for monitoring and supportive care interventions for \nthe management of nonhematologic adverse events are outlined in the \nsection Special Considerations for the Use of TKI Therapy  in the \nalgorithm.  \nDose reduction (with close monitoring) should be considered if \nnonhematologic adverse events are not controlled by adequate \nsupportive care interventions. Switching to an alternate TKI is recommended for persistent adverse events despite dose reduction.   \nPatients should be counseled on the potential risk factors for CVD and the \nincreased risk of CVD associated with long- term TKI therapy.\n129 \nCardiovascular risk factors (eg, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, estrogen use) should be identified and controlled prior to \ninitiating TKI therapy. Patients with a history of cardiovascular risk factors \nor cardiovascular signs and symptom s should be carefully monitored for \nhigh blood pressure;  evidence of arterial, vascular , or thromboembolic \nevents ; and reduced cardiac function.\n130 Switching to an alternate TKI is \nrecommended for the onset of new arterial and vascular events,  new or \nworsening heart failure, and severe hypertension not responsive to \nantihypertensive medications. Referral to a cardiologist is recommended \nfor patients with cardiovascular risk factors for additional monitoring and/or \nassessments.  \nTreatment Goal  \nSee the section on Response Milestones After First -Line TKI Therapy .  \nMedication Cost  \nThe cost of the treatment is an important factor to consider , especially for \npatients in whom TKI therapy should be continued indefinitely .

Brand name \nand generic drugs approved by the regulatory authorities based on \npharmacokinetic equivalence can be used interchangeably. In some \ninstances,  the safety profile of the generic drug may be different than that \nof the brand name drug (likely due to differences  in formulation) and \neffective management of adverse effects associated with generic drugs is essential to prevent treatment interruption.\n138 Clinicians should be aware \nof the potential pharmacokinetic variability and monitor patients closely \nduring transitions, particularly for drugs with narrow therapeutic windows \nsuch as nilotinib and bosutinib.  \nMonitoring Response to TKI Therapy  \nResponse to TKI therapy is determined by the measurement of \nhematologic (normalization of peripheral blood counts), cytogenetic \n(decrease in the number of Ph- positive metaphases using bone marrow \ncytogenetics), and molecular assessments  (decrease in the amount of \nBCR::ABL1  chimeric mRNA using qPCR). The criteria for hematologic, \ncytogenetic, and molecular response are summarized in CML -F.  \nConventional bone marrow cytogenetics is the standard method for \nmonitoring cytogenetic responses, and many clinical trial response \nanalyses have been based on conventional bone marrow cytogenetics. \nWith the advent of qPCR, bone marrow cytogenetic analyses  to assess \nresponse are rarely performed. If conventional bone marrow cytogenetics yield no analyzable metaphases, cytogenetic response can be evaluated \nby FISH, preferably with a dual color probe to minimize false- positive rates. FISH and cytogenetic results are correlated, but are not \nsuperimposable.\n139- 141 Although some investigators have reported that \ninterphase FISH can be used to monitor complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), inadequate response to TKI therapy has not been defined on the \nbasis of FISH analysis.\n142,143 The Panel feels that FISH has been \ninadequately studied for monitoring response to TKI therapy and is not \ngenerally recommended for monitoring response if conventional \ncytogenetics or qPCR are available.  \nqPCR is the only tool capable of monitoring responses after the patient \nhas achieved CCyR, since BCR::ABL1  transcripts typically remain \ndetectable after CCyR is achieved. A major advantage of qPCR is the \nstrong correlation between the results obtained from the peripheral blood \nand the bone marrow, allowing for molecular monitoring without bone \nmarrow aspirations.144,145  \nStandardization of Molecular Monitoring Using the International Scale  \nIn the IS, the standardized baseline (defined as the median expression of \nBCR::ABL1  transcripts in 30 patients with untreated CML enrolled in the \nIRIS trial) is set to 100%. Molecular response is expressed as log-\nreduction from 100%. For example, a ≥2-log reduction (≤1% BCR::ABL1  \nIS; MR2.0) generally correlates with CCyR and a ≥3- log reduction (≤0.1% \nBCR::ABL1  IS) is referred to as MMR or MR3.0.18,146,147  \nDMR is defined by the assay's level of sensitivity [≤0.01% BCR::ABL1  (IS), \nMR4.0; ≤0.0032% BCR::ABL1  (IS), MR4.5].148 The sensitivity of a qPCR \nassay depends not only on the performance of the assay, but also on the quality of a given sample.  \nAs such, the term “complete molecular response” to denote undetectable \nBCR::ABL1  transcripts (a negative qPCR test) should be abandoned, as \nit may refer to very different levels of response, dependent on the quality of the sample and sensitivity of the test.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-13 individual assays, but the BCR::ABL1  transcripts obtained in a given \nlaboratory should be converted to the IS by applying a laboratory -specific \nconversion factor (CF).18,149  \nRecommendations for Monitoring Response to TKI Therapy  \nqPCR (IS) is the preferred method to monitor response to TKI therapy.  \nqPCR assays with a sensitivity of ≥4.5 -log reduction from the standardized \nbaseline are recommended to measure BCR::ABL1  transcripts ( CML -G). \nIn patients with prolonged myelosuppression who may not be in complete \nhematologic response (CHR) due to persistent cytopenias or an \nunexplained drop in blood counts during therapy, bone marrow \ncytogenetics is indicated to confirm response to TKI therapy and exclude \nother pathology, such as MDS or the presence of chromosomal \nabnormalities other than Ph. Given the risk for transient myelosuppression \nthat can occur during early disease responses, TKI therapy should not be \nheld while bone marrow evaluation is pending.  \nMonitoring with qPCR (IS) every 3 months is recommended for all patients after initiating TKI therapy, including those who meet response milestones \nat 3, 6, and 12 months (≤10% BCR::ABL1 IS  at 3 and 6 months, ≤1% \nBCR::ABL1 IS at 12 months, and ≤0.1% BCR::ABL1  IS at >12 months). \nAfter CCyR (≤1% BCR::ABL1 IS) has been achieved, molecular \nmonitoring is recommended every 3 months for 2 years and every 3 to 6 months thereafter.  \nFrequent molecular monitoring with qPCR (IS) can help to identify non-adherence to TKI therapy early in the treatment course.\n150 Since \nadherence to TKI therapy is associated with better clinical outcomes, \nfrequent molecular monitoring is essential if there are concerns about the \npatient's adherence to TKI therapy. In patients with deeper molecular \nresponses (MMR and better) and adherence to TKI therapy, the frequency \nof molecular monitoring can be reduced, though the optimal frequency is unknown. Molecular monitoring of response to TKI therapy more \nfrequently than every 3 months is not presently recommended.  \nPrognostic Significance of Cytogenetic and Molecular Response  \nEarly molecular response (EMR; ≤10% BCR::ABL1  IS at 3 and 6 \nmonths) after first -line TKI therapy has emerged as an effective \nprognosticator of favorable long -term PFS and OS  (Table 5).102,122,151,152 \nSome reports  suggest that EMR at 3 months has a superior prognostic \nvalue and supports early intervention strategies based on the \nBCR::ABL1  transcript level at 3 months.153,154 However, other studies \nyielded partially conflicting results regarding the predictive value of \nBCR::ABL1  transcripts at 3 months.155 From a practical perspective, it is \nimportant to consider these data points within the clinical context. For instance, if BCR::ABL1  transcript level is minimally above the 10% cutoff \n(eg, 11% –15% at 3 months), it is reasonable to reassess at 6 months \nbefore considering major changes to the treatment strategy.  \nSome studies have suggested that the rate of decline in BCR::ABL1  \ntranscripts correlates with longer -term response.\n156- 158 Among patients \nwith >10% BCR::ABL1  IS after 3 months of treatment with imatinib, those \nwith a faster decline in BCR::ABL1  (BCR::ABL1 halving time <76 days) \nhad a superior outcome compared to those with a slower decline (4- year \nPFS rate was 92% vs. 63%, respectively).156 In the German CML IV \nstudy, lack of a half -log reduction of BCR::ABL1  transcripts at 3 months \nwas associated with a higher risk of disease progression on imatinib \ntherapy.157 The results of the D -First study also showed that in patients \ntreated with dasatinib, BCR::ABL1  halving time of ≤14 days was a \nsignificant predictor of MMR by 12 months and DMR (MR4.0; ≤0.01% \nBCR::ABL1  IS) by 18 months.158 \nAchievement of  CCyR or ≤1% BCR::ABL1  IS within 12 months after first -\nline TKI therapy is an established prognostic indicator of long- term \nsurvival.159,160 In the IRIS study, the estimated 6 -year PFS rate was 97% PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-14 for patients achieving a CCyR at 6 months compared to 80% for patients \nwith no cytogenetic response at 6 months.159 In an analysis of patients \nwith newly diagnosed CP -CML treated with imatinib or 2G TKIs, the 3 -\nyear EFS and OS rates were 98% and 99% for patients who achieved \nCCyR at 12 months compared to 67% and 94% in patients who did not \nachieve a CCyR.160  \nMMR (≤0.1% BCR::ABL1 IS) as a predictor of PFS and OS has also \nbeen evaluated in several studies.144,161- 167 In all of these studies, the \nanalyses were done for different outcomes measures at multiple time points, but did not  adjust for multiple comparisons, thereby reducing the \nvalidity of the conclusions. The general conclusion from these studies is that the achievement of MMR is associated with durable long -term \ncytogenetic remission and lower rate of disease progression, but MMR is \nnot a significant predictor of superior OS in patients with a stable CCyR. \nImportantly, with longer follow -up, CCyR becomes an ev er-stronger \nindicator of MMR, reducing the added prognostic value of MMR. \nAlthough the CML IV study showed that MR4.5 ( ≤0.0032% BCR::ABL1 \nIS) at 4 years was associated with a significantly higher OS (independent \nof therapy) than MR2.0 ( ≤1% BCR::ABL1 IS, which corresponds to \nCCyR), this study demonstrated no significant differences in OS  in \npatients who achieved MMR ( ≤0.1% BCR::ABL1 IS) and those who \nachieved MR2.0 (≤1% BCR::ABL1 IS).\n166  \nThe absence of MMR in the presence of a CCyR is therefore not \nconsidered as an inadequate response to treatment. While some \ninvestigators have reported that dose escalation of imatinib might benefit \npatients in CCyR with no MMR,168 there are no randomized studies to \nshow that a change of therapy would improve survival, PFS, or EFS in this \ngroup of patients.169 However, t he achievement of MMR (≤0.1% \nBCR::ABL1 IS) at 12 months is associated with a very low probability of \nsubsequent loss of response  and a high likelihood of achieving a \nsubsequent DMR (MR4.0; ≤0.01% BCR::ABL1  IS), which may facilitate discontinuation of TKI therapy.46,167 In view of the ongoing evolution of \ntreatment goals (OS vs. treatment -free remission [TFR]), expert Panels \nhave emphasized the importance of joint decision- making between \npatient and provider, particularly in ambiguous situations.170  \nResponse Milestones After First -Line TKI Therapy  \nThe most important goals of TKI therapy are to prevent disease \nprogression to AP -CML or BP -CML and to achieve either MR2.0 ( ≤1% \nBCR::ABL1 IS, which corresponds to CCyR) or MMR ( ≤0.1% BCR::ABL1 \nIS) within 12 months after first -line TKI therapy . The guidelines emphasize \nthat achievement of response milestones must be interpreted within the clinical context, before making drastic changes to the treatment strategy, \nespecially in ambiguous situations.  \nThe Panel has included ≤10% BCR::ABL1  IS at 3 and 6 months after \ninitiation of first -line TKI therapy as a response milestone since the \nachievement of EMR after first -line TKI therapy is an effective \nprognosticator of favorable long- term PFS ( CML -3). Achievement of \n>0.1% to 1% BCR::ABL1  IS (≤1% BCR::ABL1  IS, which correlates with \nCCyR) is considered the optimal response milestone at 12 months if the \ngoal of therapy in an individual patient  is long -term survival, whereas the \nachievement of MMR (≤0.1% BCR::ABL1 IS) at 12 months should be \nconsidered as the optimal response milestone if the treatment goal in an \nindividual patient is TFR. Patients who achieve these response milestones \nare considered to have TKI -sensitive disease, and continuation of the \nsame dose of TKI and assessment of BCR::ABL1  transcripts with qPCR \n(IS) every 3 months is recommended for this group of patients.  \nInability to achieve ≤10% BCR::ABL1  IS at 3 months or ≤1% BCR::ABL1  \nIS at 12 months is associated with a higher risk for disease progression. \nClinical judgment should be used in patients with a >10% BCR::ABL1 IS at \n3 months and >1% BCR::ABL1  IS at 12 months , considering problems PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

BCR::ABL1  mutational analysis should be considered .  \nAchievement of ≤10% BCR::ABL1  IS (which correlates with MCyR) \nwithin 2 years is associated with favorable long-term OS , even if deeper \nmolecular response  is not achieved .171 These data suggest that patients \nwith >1% to 10% BCR::ABL1  at 12 months have favorable outcomes . \nPatients with  a >50% reduction in BCR::ABL1  levels compared to \nbaseline or if BCR::ABL1  is minimally above the 10% cutoff at 12 months \ncan continue the same dose of TKI for another 3 months. Bone marrow \ncytogenetics should be considered to assess for CCyR at 12 months  in \ncases where the BCR::ABL1  transcript level is between 1% and 10% . The \nsame dose of TKI can be continued if CCyR is achieved. Switching to \nalternate 2G TKI or asciminib or 3G TKI should be considered if CCyR is \nnot achieved or in the absence of continuing decline in BCR::ABL1 \ntranscript levels.  BCR::ABL1  mutational analysis should be considered . \nIn patients with >0.1% to 1% BCR::ABL1  IS at 12 months, shared \ndecision- making is recommended depending on the goal of therapy in \nindividual patients (longer -term survival vs. TFR). As discussed before, \nalthough not associated with increased OS, MMR at 12 months is \nassociated with a lower rate of disease progression and a higher likelihood \nof achieving DMR, which is a prerequisite for TFR.46,167 Switching from \nimatinib to a 2G TKI or asciminib may  increase the probability of achieving MMR (≤0.1% BCR::ABL1 IS) at 12 months. However,  the side effect \nprofile of alternative TKIs may differ.  Referral to specialized CML centers \nand/or enrollment in a clinical trial should be considered.  \nPatients with >10% BCR::ABL1  IS at 6 and 12 months are considered to \nhave TKI -resistant disease. Evaluation for allogeneic HCT (discussion with \na transplant specialist, which might include HLA testing) is recommended. \nBone marrow cytogenetic analysis to assess ACAs should be considered. \nAlternative treatment options should be considered as described below.  \nSecond -Line Therapy  \nDose escalation of imatinib up to 800 mg daily has been shown to \novercome some cases of primary resistance and is particularly effective \nfor cytogenetic relapse in patients who had achieved cytogenetic response \nwith imatinib 400 mg daily, although the duration of responses has \ntypically been short.172- 175 However, it is unlikely to benefit patients who do \nnot achieve hematologic response or those who never had a cytogenetic \nresponse with imatinib 400 mg daily.  \nIn patients with >10% BCR::ABL1  IS at 3 months after imatinib 400 mg, \nswitching to nilotinib or dasatinib has been shown to result in higher rates of MMR at 12 months than dose escalation of imatinib.\n176- 178 Although \ndose escalation of imatinib has been shown to be beneficial for patients in \nCCyR without MMR, no randomized studies have shown that a change of \ntherapy would improve PFS or EFS in this group of patients.168,169  \nDasatinib  and nilotinib  retain activity against many of the imatinib- resistant \nBCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutants except T315I  and are effective \ntreatment options for CP-CML that is resistant to imatinib and also for \npatients who are intolerant to imatinib.179,180 Bosutinib also has \ndemonstrated activity in CP -CML that is resistant to multiple TKIs \n(imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib).181-183 Ponatinib and asciminib are active PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

The incidence of cardiovascular \nadverse events was highest among patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors .\n184,188- 190 In the PACE trial, serious arterial and \nvascular adverse events (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and \nperipheral vascular) and venous thromboembolic events occurred in 31% \nand 6% of patients, respectively.184 Cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and \nperipheral vascular adverse events were reported in 16%, 13%, and 14% \nof patients, respectively.  \nSee Special Considerations for the Use of TKI Therapy  in the algorithm \nfor the supportive care interventions and treatment recommendations for \nthe management of arterial and cardiovascular adverse events \nassociated with ponatinib.  \nIn the OPTIC trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of response -\nadjusted dosing regimen, patients were randomized to ponatinib starting doses of 45 mg, 30 mg, and 15 mg, with dose reduction to 15 mg with \nachievement of ≤1% BCR::ABL1  (IS) in the 45 mg and 30 mg cohorts.\n185 \nPonatinib was effective at all 3 dose levels (45 mg, 30 mg, and 15 mg) and the maximum benefit was observed with 45 mg. After a median follow -up \nof 32 months, BCR::ABL1  (IS) ≤1% at 12 months was achieved in 44% of \npatients in the 45 mg cohort compared to 29% and 23% in the 30 mg and \n15 mg cohorts, respectively. After response- based dose reduction to 15 mg, responses were maintained in 73% and 79% of patients in the 45 mg and 30 mg cohorts, respectively. The rate of any arterial and vascular \nadverse events reported in the OPTIC trial (10% in the 45 mg cohort; 5% \nand 3% in the 30 mg and 15 mg cohorts, respectively) was lower than that reported for ponatinib 45 mg in the PACE trial. Based on the results of the \nOPTIC trial, the FDA has approved a response -adjusted dosing regimen \nfor ponatinib [starting dose of 45 mg once daily with a reduction to 15 mg upon achievement of BCR::ABL1  (IS) ≤1%] for patients with CP -CML  with \nresistance or intolerance to at least two prior kinase inhibitors.  \nAsciminib is approved for CP -CML with T315I mutation and/or previously \ntreated CP-CML. In the phase III randomized study (ASCEMBL), asciminib \n40 mg twice daily  achieved higher molecular response rates (MMR, \nMR4.0, and MR4.5) than bosutinib 500 mg once daily  in patients with CP -\nCML previously treated with ≥2 prior TKIs.186 Gastrointestinal toxicities \n(diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) and biochemical abnormalities (increased ALT and AST levels) were notably higher with bosutinib. \nArterial and vascular adverse events were reported in 3% and 1% of patients treated with asciminib and bosutinib, respectively. The incidence \nof adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were  also lower \nwith asciminib  (8% vs. 28%) .\n186  Patients with detectable bosutinib-\nresistant BCR::ABL1  mutations (T315I or V299L) were ineligible to \nparticipate in the ASCEMBL trial. The results of the phase I dose escalation study confirmed the efficacy of asciminib in patients with \npreviously treated CP -CML with a T315I mutation.\n187 The recommended \ninitial dose of asciminib is 80 mg once daily or 40 mg twice daily in patients without a T315I mutation and 200 mg twice daily in patients with a \nT315I mutation.

As discussed earlier, myeloid \nmutational analysis using NGS to identify BCR::ABL1 –independent \nmutations may also be useful for patients with CP -CML who do not \nachieve optimal response milestones due to the presence of cytopenias \nand for those with TKI -resistant disease.  \nDrug Interactions  \nAll TKIs are metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  \nand concomitant use of drugs/food/fruits/fruit juices/supplements \nmetabolized by CYP enzymes alter the therapeutic effect of TKIs .191- 193  \nDrugs that are CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 inducers may decrease the \ntherapeutic plasma concentration of TKIs, whereas CYP3A4 inhibitors and \ndrugs that are metabolized by the CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 enzyme might \nresult in increased plasma levels of TKIs. In addition, imatinib is also a \nweak inhibitor of the CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes and nilotinib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and UGT1A1, \npotentially increasing the plasma concentrations of drugs eliminated by \nthese enzymes. Asciminib is also a CYP2C 9 inhibitor and concomitant use \nof asciminib increases the plasma concentration of other drugs that are CYP2C9 substrates.  Fruits/fruit juices  that inhibit the activity of CYP3A4 enzyme (eg , \ngrapefruit, star fruit , black mulberry , black raspberry, wild grape, \npomegranate) should be avoided since they increase the therapeutic plasma concentration of TKIs.\n191 If coadministration  of medications and \nsupplements  that are metabolized by CYP enzymes cannot be avoided, \ndose modification should be considered,  and appropriate alternatives \nshould be explored to minimize toxicity . Alternative acid -reducing \nstrategies such as the use of H2R As or spacing out PPI use from TKI \nadministration may be preferable if coadministration of TKIs with PPIs \ncannot be avoided.  A pH -independent formulation of dasatinib that can be \nadministered concomitantly  with PPIs or H2RAs has been approved by the \nFDA as  an alternative treatment option for adult patients with CML.  \nSee Drug Interactions of TKIs  in the algorithm (CML -D) for specific \ninteractions of TKIs with the most commonly used medications , \nsupplements , and fruits/fruit juices . \nAdherence to Therapy  \nTreatment interruptions and non- adherence to therapy may lead to \nundesirable clinical outcomes.194- 196 In the ADAGIO study, non- adherence \nto imatinib was associated with poorer response. Patients with suboptimal \nresponse missed significantly more imatinib doses (23%) than did those \nwith optimal response (7%).194 Adherence to imatinib therapy has been \nidentified as the only independent predictor for achieving complete \nmolecular response (CMR) on standard- dose imatinib.195 The 6- year \nprobability of achieving CMR was significantly higher for patients with a \n>90% adherence rate (44% compared to 0% for patients with ≤90% \nadherence rate; P = .002).195 Poor adherence to imatinib therapy has also \nbeen identified as the most important factor contributing to cytogenetic relapse and inadequate response to imatinib.\n196 Patients with adherence of \n≤85% had a higher probability of losing CCyR at 2 years than those with \nadherence of >85% (27% and 2%, respectively).

In a \nsignificant proportion of patients with TKI -induced toxicities, responses \nhave been observed with doses well below their determined maximum tolerated doses.\n199 Short interruptions or dose reductions, when medically \nnecessary, may not have a negative impact on disease control or other \noutcomes. Adequate and appropriate management of side effects and \nscheduling appropriate follow -up visits to review side effects may be \nhelpful to improve patient adherence to therapy.200  \nSwitching to an alternate TKI because of intolerance is appropriate for \npatients with disease responding to TKI therapy and it might be beneficial \nfor selected patients with acute grade ≥3 nonhematologic toxicities or in \nthose with chronic, low -grade nonhematologic toxicities  that are not \nmanageable with adequate supportive care interventions .201,202 Asciminib \nand p onatinib are appropriate treatment options for CP -CML with \nintolerance to prior 2G TKIs .  \nAdverse events of second -line and subsequent TKI therapy in patients \nwith CP -CML are summarized in Table 8 . \nResistance to TKI Therapy  \nAberrant expressions of drug transporters203- 205 and plasma protein \nbinding of TKI206- 208 could contribute to primary resistance by altering the \nintracellular and plasma concentration of TKI.  \nPretreatment levels of organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) have been \nreported as the most powerful predictor of response to imatinib.209 On the \nother hand, cellular uptake of dasatinib or nilotinib seems to be \nindependent of OCT1 expression, suggesting that patients with low OCT1 expression might have better outcomes with dasatinib or nilotinib \nthan with imatinib .210- 213  \nMonitoring imatinib plasma levels may be useful in determining patient \nadherence to therapy. However, there are no data to support that change \nof therapy based on plasma imatinib levels will affect treatment \noutcomes, and assays that measure plasma levels of imatinib are not \nwidely available.  \nBCR::ABL1 Kinase Domain Mutation Analysis  \nPoint mutations in the BCR::ABL1  kinase domain are a frequent \nmechanism of secondary resistance to TKI therapy.214- 219 The efficacy of a \nTKI against BCR::ABL1  kinase domain mutations  varies based on the IC 50 \nvalues (concentration of TKI required for 50% inhibition),  with select \nmutations conferring a lesser degree of resistance to a given TKI  and \nother mutations confer ring a stronger degree of resistance to the same \nTKI.220  \nT315I confers complete resistance to imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and \nbosutinib.221,222 T315A, F317L/I/V/C, and V299L  mutants are resistant to \ndasatinib and the E255K/V, F359V/C,  and Y253H mutants are resistant to \nnilotinib.223- 226 The G250E and V299L mutants are resistant to bosutinib.227 \nE255K/V, F359C/V, Y253H, and T315I mutants are most commonly \nassociated with disease progression and relapse.226,228 There are limited \ndata available regarding the impact of new myristoyl -pocket mutations \ndetected during asciminib treatment on the efficacy of asciminib,  and \npatients with detectable bosutinib- resistant BCR::ABL1  mutations (T315I \nor V299L) were ineligible to participate in the ASCEMBL trial.186 A337T, \nP465S, F359V/I/C , and M244V are considered as contraindicated \nmutations to asciminib.229,230 \nDasatinib and bosutinib have demonstrated activity in patients with \nBCR::ABL1  mutants resistant to nilotinib (Y253H, E255K/V, and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

This study, however, was not powered to determine the efficacy of \n2G TKI against BCR- ABL135INS since very few patients with this mutation \nreceived either dasatinib or nilotinib.   \nBCR::ABL1  compound mutations ( variants containing ≥2 mutations within \nthe same BCR::ABL1  allele that presumably arise sequentially) confer \ndifferent levels of resistance to TKI therapy, and compound mutants \ninvolving T315I confer the highest level of resistance to all TKIs, including \nponatinib.220,234,235 In another study that used NGS to detect low- level and \nBCR::ABL1  compound mutations in 267 patients with heavily pretreated \nCP-CML from the PACE trial, no compound mutation was identified that \nconsistently conferred resistance to ponatinib, suggesting that such \ncompound mutations are uncommon following treatment with bosutinib, \ndasatinib, or nilotinib for CP- CML.236  \nBCR::ABL1  kinase domain mutational analysis is helpful in the selection of \nsubsequent TKI therapy for patients with inadequate initial response to first-line or second -line TKI therapy.237 The guidelines recommend \nBCR::ABL1  kinase domain mutational analysis for patients who do not \nachieve response milestones, for those with any sign of loss of response \n(hematologic or cytogenetic relapse), and if there is a 1 -log increase in \nBCR::ABL1 level with loss of MMR. BCR::ABL1  kinase domain mutational \nanalysis provides additional guidance for selecting subsequent TKI \ntherapy only in patients with identifiable mutations.  Treatment \nrecommendations based on BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutation status \nare outlined on CML -5.  \nSwitching to an alternate TKI (based on the BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutation status) is recommended for patients with disease that is resistant \nto primary treatment with imatinib. Patients with disease that is resistant to \nprimary treatment with asciminib, bosutinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib could be switched to an alternate TKI (based on the BCR::ABL1 kinase domain \nmutation status). However, there is no clear evidence to support tha t \nswitching to an alternate TKI would improve long -term clinical outcome for  \nthis group of patients.\n238 Ponatinib is a treatment option for patients with a \nT315I mutation in any phase (preferred for AP -CML or BP -CML) and \nasciminib is a treatment option for patients with CP -CML having a T315I \nmutation.  \nSubsequent therapy with an alternate TKI is expected to be effective only \nin patients with identifiable BCR::ABL1  mutations that confer resistance \nto TKI therapy. In patients with no identifiable mutations, the selection of subsequent TKI therapy should be based on the patient’s age, ability to \ntolerate therapy, presence of comorbid conditions, and toxicity profile of \nthe TKI . Ponatinib is preferred for patients with no identifiable \nBCR::ABL1  mutations. Evaluation of allogeneic HCT or enrollment in a \nclinic al trial should be considered for this group of patients .

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-20 Rising BCR::ABL1 Transcripts  \nRising BCR::ABL1 transcripts are associated with an increased likelihood \nof detecting BCR::ABL1  kinase domain mutations and cytogenetic \nrelapse.239- 243 In patients who had achieved very low levels of BCR::ABL1  \ntranscripts, emergence of BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutations was more \nfrequent in those who had a >2- fold increase in BCR::ABL1  transcripts \ncompared to those with stable or decreasing BCR::ABL1 transcripts.239 A \nserial rise has been reported to be more reliable than a single ≥2- fold \nincrease in BCR::ABL1  transcripts.240,241 Among patients in CCyR with a \n≥0.5-log increase in BCR::ABL1  transcripts on at least two occasions, the \nhighest risk of disease progression was associated with loss of MMR and \n>1-log increase in BCR::ABL1  transcripts.241 \nRising transcript levels should prompt an investigation of treatment \nadherence and reassessment of coadministered medications. The precise \nincrease in BCR::ABL1 transcripts that warrants a mutation analysis \ndepends on the performance characteristics of the qPCR assay.243 Some \nlaboratories have advocated a 2- to 3-fold range,164,242,243 while others \nhave taken a more conservative approach ( 5- to 10- fold).241 Obviously, \nsome common sense must prevail, since the amount of change in \nabsolute terms depends on the level of molecular response. For example, \na finding of any BCR::ABL1  after achieving a DMR (MR4.5; ≤0.0032% \nBCR::ABL1  IS) is an infinite increase in BCR::ABL1  transcripts. However, \na change in BCR::ABL1  transcripts from a barely detectable level to \nMR4.5 is clearly different from a 5 -fold increase in BCR::ABL1  transcripts \nafter achieving MMR.   \nCurrently there are no specific guidelines for changing therapy only \nbased on rising BCR::ABL1 levels as detected by qPCR, and it should be \ndone only in the context of a clinical trial.  Discontinuation of TKI Therapy  \nThe feasibility of discontinuation of TKI therapy  (dasatinib, imatinib, or \nnilotinib) with close monitoring in carefully selected patients who have \nachieved and maintained DMR (≥MR4.0; ≤0.01% BCR::ABL1  IS) for ≥2 \nyears has been evaluated in several clinical studies.244- 258 Longer -term \nfollow- up data from the TKI discontinuation trials are summarized in \nTable 9.  \nThe results of the RE -STIM study demonstrated the safety of a second \nTKI discontinuation after a first unsuccessful attempt.259 The rate of \nmolecular relapse after the first TKI discontinuation attempt was the only \nfactor significantly associated with outcome. The TFR rate 24 months \nafter the second TKI discontinuation was higher for patients who \nremained in DMR within the first 3  months after the first TKI \ndiscontinuation (72% vs. 32% for other patients).   \nApproximately 40% to 60% of patients who discontinue TKI therapy after \nachieving DMR experience recurrence within 12 months of treatment \ncessation, in some cases as early as 1 month after discontinuation of TKI \ntherapy. Disease characteristics at diagnosis, blast cell and platelet count \nin peripheral blood, a higher Sokal risk score, female gender, lower \nnatural killer  (NK) cell counts, suboptimal response or resistance to \nimatinib, duration of TKI therapy , and DMR prior to TKI discontinuation  \nhave been identified as independent factors predictive of risk of \nrecurrence after TKI discontinuation.244,249,253,258 The duration of TKI \ntherapy prior to discontinuation was significantly associated with the \nmaintenance of MMR  between 6 and 36 months after TKI discontinuation  \nin the EURO -SKI study .258 The EURO -SKI study  also reported that  the \npresence of transcript type e13a2 together with e14a2 was associated \nwith a higher probability of maintaining MMR over 36 months compared \nto the presence of e13a2 alone.258  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-21 Lack of MR4.0 at 36 months after discontinuation of TKI therapy was \nhighly predictive of subsequent loss of MMR  in the AFTER -SKI study .260 \nA rapid initial decline in BCR::ABL1  transcripts after initiation of first -line \nTKI therapy has also been shown to be an independent predictor of TFR \neligibility and sustained TFR.261  \nResumption of TKI therapy immediately after recurrence results in the achievement of DMR in almost all patients.  In the STIM study, molecular \nrelapse (trigger to resume TKI therapy) was defined as positivity for BCR::ABL1  transcripts by qPCR confirmed by a 1 -log increase in \nBCR::ABL1  transcripts between two successive assessments or loss of \nMMR at one point.\n244,245 The results of the A -STIM study showed that loss \nof MMR (≤0.1% BCR::ABL1  IS) could be used as a practical criterion for \nrestarting TKI therapy. The estimated probability of MMR loss was 35% at \n12 months and 36% at 24 months after discontinuation of imatinib.247  \nTKI withdrawal syndrome (aggravation or new development of \nmusculoskeletal pain and/or pruritus after discontinuation of TKI therapy) \nhas been reported during the  TFR period  in some TKI discontinuation \nstudies.249,253,255,256 The occurrence of imatinib withdrawal syndrome was \nassociated with a lower rate of molecular relapse in the KID study .249 \nTFR after discontinuation of ponatinib in patients achieving DMR (MR4.5 \nfor at least 2 years) has been reported  in a small cohort of patients.262 \nThe feasibility of TFR following discontinuation of TKIs other than \ndasatinib, imatinib, or nilotinib has not yet been evaluated in prospective \nclinical studies. In the EURO -SKI study that evaluated TFR after \ndiscontinuation of any first -line TKI therapy (imatinib, dasatinib, or \nnilotinib) in eligible patients, the type of first -line TKI therapy did not \nsignificantly affect molecular relapse -free survival.258 Therefore, it is \nreasonable to assume that the likelihood of TFR following discontinuation \nwould be similar irrespective of TKI in patients who have achieved and \nmaintained DMR (MR4.0; ≤0.01% BCR::ABL1  IS) for ≥2 years.  Clinical studies that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of discontinuation of TKI have used strict eligibility criteria and have \nmandated more frequent molecular monitoring than typically \nrecommended for patients on TKI therapy. Access to a reliable qPCR (IS) \nwith a sensitivity of detection of at least MR4.5 ( BCR::ABL1  ≤0.0032% IS) \nand the availability of test results within 2 weeks is one of the key requirements to monitor patients after discontinuation of TKI therapy and \nascertain their safety.  \nBased on available evidence from clinical studies that have evaluated the feasibility of TFR, the Panel members feel that discontinuation of TKI \ntherapy (with close monitoring) is feasible in carefully selected, consenting \npatients (in early CP -CML) who have achieved and maintained a DMR \n(≥MR4.0) for ≥2 years. The Panel acknowledges that more frequent \nmolecular monitoring is essential following discontinuation of TKI therapy \nfor the early identification of loss of MMR. Frequency of molecular \nmonitoring has varied substantially among different studies, and the \noptimal frequency of molecular monitoring in patients with a loss of  MMR \nafter discontinuation of TKI therapy has not been established.  \nThe criteria for the selection of patients suitable for discontinuation of TKI therapy and recommendations for molecular monitoring in TFR phase are \noutlined on CML -H. The Panel emphasizes that discontinuation of TKI \ntherapy outside of a clinical trial should be considered only if ALL  the \ncriteria included on the list are met.   \nLimited available data (mainly from case reports) suggest that stable and \nwell-controlled chronic CML  (≥MR2.0)  is not an absolute contraindication \nto solid organ transplant.263-265 The Panel acknowledges that the \nmanagement of TKI along with antirejection therapy (in patients who \nundergo transplant) will require close coordination between the patient’s \noncologist and the transplant team.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-22 Dose Modifications of TKI Therapy  \nLimited available evidence (mostly from non -randomized studies and \nretrospective analysis) suggests that initiation of TKIs ( ie, bosutinib, \ndasatinib, nilotinib) at lower doses and/or de -escalation for all TKIs (with \nclose monitoring) in patients who achieve optimal responses are \nappropriate strategies for the prevention and management of treatment-\nrelated adverse events and to avoid long- term toxicities. However, \nexcept for ponatinib (OPTIC trial), the minimum effective dose or optimal de-escalation of TKI  has not yet been established in prospective phase \nIII randomized clinical trials.   Initiation of TKIs at Lower Dose  Low-dose \nTKIs for first- line or dose modifications for intolerance or resistance have \nbeen evaluated mostly in non- randomized studies and retrospective \nanalyses.  \nData from selected studies are outlined in Table 10 and Table 11 .  \nBosutinib  \nThe recommended starting dose of bosutinib is 400 mg daily for patients \nwith newly diagnosed CP- CML (which is better tolerated than the 500 -mg \ndaily dose that was used in the initial randomized phase III trial) and 500 mg once daily for intolerant or resistant CP- CML.  \nIn patients with newly diagnosed CP -CML, recommendations from an \nexpert Panel suggest initiating bosutinib at 200 to 300 mg once daily (with \ndose escalation as clinically indicated) in most patients , and initiation at \n400 mg daily is recommended only for patients with high- risk disease.\n266  \nTreatment with lower dose bosutinib (≤400) has also been shown to \nreduce the incidences of drug- related adverse events without \ncompromising efficacy in patients with CP -CML –resistant imatinib, \ndasatinib, and/or nilotinib.267,268                                                                                                           Dasatinib  \nThe recommended starting dose of dasatinib is 100 mg once daily for patients with CP -CML.  \nLong- term follow- up of a single- arm study (81 evaluable patients) \nsuggest s that dasatinib 50 mg once daily may have similar efficacy in \npatients with low - or intermediate- risk CP -CML.\n269,270 Dasatinib 20 mg \nonce daily has also been shown to be an appropriate starting dose for \npatients ≥65 years with newly diagnosed CP -CML.271,272 Intermittent \ndosing (on/off treatment with a drug holiday) or dose reduction to 50 mg once daily has also been shown to be effective as second- line and \nsubsequent therapy in patients with CP -CML resistant/intolerant to \nimatinib.\n273- 276  \nDasatinib at 50 mg (20 mg with careful monitoring in selected patients) should be considered for patients with clinically significant intolerance to \ndasatinib 100 mg once daily to avoid serious adverse events (eg, pleural effusion, myelosuppression), neces sitating the discontinuation of \ndasatinib.  \nImatinib  \nThe recommended starting dose of imatinib is 400 mg once daily for patients with CP -CML.  \nIn a phase II study that evaluated imatinib 400 mg in 481 patients with \nnewly diagnosed CML, dose reduction was required in 46% of patients \ndue to intolerance , and excessive dose reductions to < 300 mg was \nassociated with inferior response rates and survival outcomes.\n277  \nNilotinib  \nThe recommended starting dose of nilotinib is 300 mg twice daily for \npatients with newly diagnosed CP- CML and 400 mg twice daily for \npatients with resistant or intolerant CP -CML.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-23 In a retrospective analysis of 70 patients with newly diagnosed CP -CML, \nearly dose reduction of nilotinib to < 600 mg/day resulted in a lower rate of \nadverse events and better therapeutic efficacy.278 One-year MMR and \noverall MR4.5 rates were 90% and 60%, respectively , for the 10 patients \ntreated with 600 mg/day of nilotinib throughout the study, with no disease \nprogression to advanced phase. \nThe ENESTswift study showed that switching to nilotinib 300 mg twice \ndaily (which is lower than the recommended dose of 400 mg daily in the \nsecond- line setting) was effective and well- tolerated in most patients with \nCP-CML with intolerance to imatinib or dasatinib in the first -line setting.279 \nNilotinib tablets with improved bioavailability (without compromise in efficacy) that allows for administration at lower doses without mealtime \nrestrictions has been approved by the FDA. Refer to package insert for \nfull prescribing information: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov . \nPonatinib  \nThe recommended initial dose of ponatinib is 45 mg once daily.  \nIn the OPTIC trial, the optimal benefit was observed with 45 mg once daily \nfor all patients including those with the T315I mutation. Ponatinib at lower \ndose levels (30 mg once daily and 15 mg once daily) resulted in clinical \nbenefit in patients without theT315I mutation ( Table 6). These data \nsupport initiation of ponatinib at 45 mg once daily for patients with the T315I mutation followed by dose reduction to 15 mg once daily upon \nachievement of BCR::ABL1  (IS) ≤1%.\n185  \nThe results of a retrospective analysis showed that ponatinib 15 mg daily \nwas associated with a lower incidence of drug- related adverse events with \nno impact on efficacy.280 De-escalation or Intermittent Dosing of TKI  \nTKI de- escalation has been shown to be feasible in patients, primarily \nthose without prior TKI resistance, who had received TKI therapy for ≥2 \nyears with durable MMR or DMR for ≥12 months.281-288  \nData from selected clinical trials that have evaluated this approach are \nsummarized in Table 12 .   \nThe phase II INTERIM study first established that intermittent dosing of \nimatinib is feasible in patients ≥65 years in stable MMR or MR4, after ≥2 \nyears of treatment.281 The results  of the phase III OPTkIMA study \ndemonstrated that this approach is also feasible for patients treated with \ndasatinib or nilotinib.289 OPTkIMA is an ongoing study that is evaluating \nthe potential de- escalation of all TKIs after achieving a stable DMR.   \nThe DESTINY trial showed the feasibility of de -escalating TKIs (imatinib, \ndasatinib, or nilotinib) to half the standard dose for 12 months (imatinib \n200 mg once daily; dasatinib 50 mg once daily, or nilotinib 200 mg twice \ndaily) in patients achieving MMR or MR4 followed by discontinuation for \n24 months  (with frequent monitoring).284,285 \nThe NILO -RED study (published only as an abstract) demonstrated the \nfeasibility of maintenance therapy with reduced -dose nilotinib (once \ndaily) in patients achieving MMR on standard -dose nilotinib (twice daily).  \nManagement of Advanced Phase CML  \nImatinib has induced favorable hematologic and cytogenetic response \nrates in patients with AP -CML or BP -CML.290- 294 Dasatinib,295- 297 \nnilotinib,298,299 bosutinib,300 and ponatinib184 have demonstrated activity in \nimatinib -resistant or imatinib- intolerant AP- CML and/or BP -CML.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-24 The efficacy of imatinib in combination with decitabine or cytarabine -\nbased chemotherapy in AP -CML and myeloid BP -CML has been \ndemonstrated in several small studies.301- 304 Hyper -CVAD in combination \nwith imatinib or dasatinib is also effective for patients with lymphoid BP -\nCML, particularly when followed by allogeneic HCT.305,306 Treatment with \nTKI in combination with intensive chemotherapy resulted in better \noutcomes ( higher response rates, lower risk of relapse , and improved \nOS and EFS rates ) compared to treatment with TKI alone  in patients with \nmyeloid BP -CML.307  \nLong- term follow -up data from clinical trials of TKI therapy for disease \nprogression to AP -CML and BP -CML are summarized in Table 13  and \nTable 1 4, respectively.  \nTreatment Considerations  \nParticipation in clinical trials and evaluation for allogeneic HCT is \nrecommended for all patients with AP -CML and BP -CML. Disease \nprogression to AP -CML or BP -CML while on TKI therapy has a worse \nprognosis than de novo AP-CML or BP -CML. Patients with disease \nprogression from CP -CML to AP -CML while on a TKI therapy have a high \nrate of progression to BP -CML, with predictably poor survival. These \npatients should be considered for a clinical trial and/or allogeneic HCT.  \nDe novo AP- CML can often be initially managed like CP -CML with single -\nagent TKI followed by evaluation for allogeneic HCT.308,309 Treatment with \na course of alternate 2G or 3G TKI (not received before) can be beneficial \nas a “bridge” to allogeneic HCT in patients with disease progression to AP -\nCML.  In patients with disease progression to AP -CML or BP -CML, the \nselection of TKI therapy is based on prior therapy and/or BCR::ABL1 \nkinase domain mutational analysis. Imatinib is not recommended for \npatients with disease progression on prior TKI therapy. However, imatinib \nmay be an appropriate option for patients with disease progression to AP -CML on TKI therapy with a contraindication to 2G or 3G TKI.310 Asciminib \nhas also demonstrated activity in a small series of patients with AP -CML  \nand is included as an option for patients with AP -CML .311 Asciminib is \ncontraindicated for CML with BCR::ABL1 / b2a3 or BCR::ABL1 /b3a3 \nisoforms .106,107 \nA significant proportion of patients with advanced phase CML treated \nwith TKI therapy achieve a MCyR but not a concomitant CHR because of \npersistent cytopenias, which in turn is associated with an inferior \noutcome.312 There is a lack of evidence for the definition of optimal \nresponse milestones on TKI therapy. Evaluation for allogeneic HCT should be considered if response milestones (recommended for CP -CML) are not \nachieved at 3, 6, and 12 months.  \nInduction therapy followed by consolidation with allogeneic HCT is the \npreferred treatment approach for de novo  BP-CML and disease \nprogression to BP -CML .\n307,313 TKI in combination with induction \nchemotherapy (ALL type chemotherapy for lymphoid BP -CML and AML \ntype chemotherapy for myeloid BP -CML) is the recommended treatment \noption.

Dasatinib has been reported to cross the \nblood brain barrier and may represent the best TKI option for patients with \nCNS disease.318 TKI therapy has not been optimized for patients with CNS \ninvolvement.  \nAllogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant  \nAllogeneic HCT is a potentially curative treatment for patients with CML. \nSeveral studies have confirmed that prior TKI therapy does not \ncompromise the outcome following allogeneic HCT or increase transplant -\nrelated toxicity.319- 325 Ongoing advances in alternative donor sources (such \nas unrelated donors and cord blood), more accurate HLA testing for a \nstringent selection of unrelated matched donors, and the use of reduced -\nintensity conditioning regimens have improved outcomes following \nallogeneic HCT.326- 332  \nAllogeneic HCT is an appropriate treatment option for patients with CP -\nCML that is resistant and/or intolerant to all available TKIs, patients with disease progression to AP -CML during TKI therapy or patients with BP -\nCML who achieve morphologic remission.\n333- 336   \nAge and sex of the donor and recipient, pretransplant disease phase, HLA \nmatching, and time from diagnosis to transplant have been identified as \npretransplant risk factors.337 A low HCT comorbidity index is a prognostic \nindicator of lower non- relapse mortality and improved survival.338 The \ndisease phase at the time of transplant remains an important  prognostic \nfactor, and the survival outcomes following transplant are clearly better for \npatients in second chronic CP -CML compared to patients with AP -CML or \nBP-CML.339- 344 Therefore, the potential use of allogeneic HCT must be tied \nto faithful monitoring of disease, since the major potential pitfall in delaying \ntransplantation is “missing” the chronic phase interval.   Monitoring Response After Allogeneic HCT  (CML -6)  \nBCR::ABL1  transcripts may persist for many years in patients after \nallogeneic HCT.  The prognostic significance of BCR::ABL1  positivity is \ninfluenced by the time of testing after allogeneic HCT.  A positive qPCR \nassay for BCR::ABL1  at ≥18 months after allogeneic HCT is associated \nwith a lower risk of relapse than a positive qPCR assay for BCR::ABL1  at \n6 to 12 months after allogeneic HCT.345- 352 Early detection of BCR::ABL1  \ntranscripts after allogeneic HCT may be useful to identify patients who may need  alternative therapies before overt relapse occurs.   \nManagement of Post- transplant Relapse (CML -6) \nDonor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is effective in inducing durable molecular \nremissions in the majority of patients with relapsed CML following \nallogeneic HCT, al though it is more effective in patients with chronic phase \nrelapse than advanced phase relapse.353- 359 However, DLI is associated \nwith complications such as graft -versus -host disease (GVHD), \nsusceptibility to infections, and immunosuppression.353 Improvements in \nthe methods of detecting BCR::ABL1  transcripts to predict relapse, the \ndevelopment of reduced -intensity conditioning regimens, modified delivery \nof lymphocytes with the depletion of CD8+ cells, and the use of escalating \ncell dosage regimens have reduced the incidence of GVHD associated \nwith DLI.360- 364  \nImatinib induces durable cytogenetic and molecular responses in the \nmajority of patients relapsing with chronic and advanced phase CML \nfollowing allogeneic HCT, and the response rates are higher in patients \nwith chronic phase relapse than advanced phase relapse.365- 372 Very \nlimited data are available on the use of dasatinib and nilotinib in patients with post -transplant relapse.\n373- 376 There are also data suggesting that the \nuse of DLI in combination with imatinib may be more effective at inducing rapid molecular remissions than either modality alone.\n377 Retrospective  \nstudies have shown that TKIs are superior to DLI alone or in combination PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

Post-transplant TKI therapy is also effective in prevent ing \nrelapse following allogeneic HCT in patients at high- risk for disease \nrelapse.380- 382 Given the high risk for hematologic relapse in patients with \nprior accelerated or blast phase, post -transplant TKI therapy should be \nconsidered for at least 1 year in this cohort of patients who are in \nremission following allogeneic HCT.   \nTKI with or without DLI can be considered for patients who are not in \nremission or in cytogenetic relapse or those with an increasing level of \nmolecular relapse. The selection of TKI depends on prior TKI  therapy , the \nside effect profile of the TKI under consideration, the presence of comorbidities, and BCR::ABL1  mutation status. Pre- existing mutations in \nthe BCR::ABL1  kinase domain, frequently associated with resistance to \nTKIs, are detectable in the majority of patients who relapse after \nallogeneic HCT.\n383 BCR::ABL1  mutational analysis is therefore essential \nprior to the selection of TKI for the treatment of post -transplant relapse.  \nIn patients with CML that has not responded to previous  imatinib, there are \nno data to support the use of post -transplant imatinib. Dasatinib, nilotinib, \nbosutinib,  ponatinib,  or asciminib  may be more appropriate options. \nHowever, there are no data to support the use of post -transplant bosutinib,   \nponatinib or asciminib . CNS relapse of CML following allogeneic HCT has \nbeen described in few case reports.384,385 Participation in a clinical trial is \nhighly desirable. Dasatinib may also be an effective treatment for \nextramedullary relapse following allogeneic HCT.318,386,387  Emerging Treatment Options \nNovel BCR::ABL1  inhibitors are being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials \nin all three phases of CML. Results from selected published phase II/III \nstudies  are outlined in Table 15 .  \nThe use of pegylated interferons in combination with 2G TKIs  is also \nbeing explored as a potential strategy to improve TFR in ongoing clinical \ntrials.388- 390 Immunotherapy approaches such as the use of BCR::ABL1  \nimmune peptides, immune checkpoint blockade, leukemia -associated \nantigens, and dendritic cell vaccines are also being evaluated to improve \nmolecular response.391   \nManagement of CML During Pregnancy and \nBreastfeeding \nThe median age of disease onset is 65 years, but CML occurs in all age \ngroups. The EUTOS population -based registry has reported that \napproximately 37% of patients at the time of diagnosis are of reproductive age.\n392 Clinical care teams should be prepared to address \nissues relating to fertility and pregnancy as well as counsel these patients about the potential risks and benefits of treatment \ndiscontinuation and possible resumption of TKI therapy should CML \nrecur duri ng pregnancy.  \nTKI Therapy and Conception  (CML -E) \nTKI therapy appears to affect some male hormones at least transiently \nbut does not appear to have a deleterious effect on male fertility. \nFurthermore, the miscarriage or fetal abnormality rate is not elevated in female partners of males on TKI therapy.\n393- 397  \nTKI therapy during pregnancy has been associated with both a higher rate of miscarriage and fetal abnormalities.\n398- 403 In one report on the \noutcome of pregnancies in 180 patients exposed to imatinib during PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

In another report on the outcomes of pregnancy and conception during treatment with \ndasatinib, among 46 patients treated with dasatinib, 15 patients (33%) \ndelivered a normal infant.\n399 Elective or spontaneous abortions were \nreported in 18 (39%) and 8 patients (17%), respectively, and 5 patients \n(11%) had an abnormal pregnancy. Fetal abnormalities were reported in \n7 cases. Among 33 patients who conceived with males who had received \ntreatment with dasatinib, 30 (91%) delivered infants who were normal at \nbirth. In a report of 16 pregnancy cases among patients assigned female at birth treated with bosutinib , there were six live births, four abortions, \nand six unknown outcomes.\n404  \nAlthough there is paucity of data regarding the outcome of pregnancy in \npatients receiving bosutinib, ponatinib or asciminib at the time of \nconception, all TKIs also must be considered unsafe for use during \npregnancy. Conception while on active TKI therapy is strongly \ndiscouraged due to the risk of fetal abnormalities. Close monitoring, and \nprompt consider ation of holding TKI therapy (if pregnancy occurs while \non TKI therapy) should be considered.  \nDepending on other factors such as age, a natural pregnancy may occur \nmonths after stopping TKI therapy.405,406 A prolonged washout period \nprior to pregnancy should be considered, although there are no data \nregarding how long a patient should be off TKI therapy before trying to \nbecome pregnant. There are no published guidelines regarding the \noptimal depth of molecular response that is considered “safe” to stop TKI \ntherapy before attempting pregnancy.407,408  \nDiscontinuation of TKI therapy because of pregnancy in patients \nassigned female at birth who were not in DMR (≤0.01% BCR::ABL1  IS) \nhas only been reported in a small series of patients.405,406,409,410 In one series, among 10 patients who stopped imatinib because of pregnancy \nafter a median of 8 months of therapy, five of the nine patients who had \nachieved a CHR lost the response after stopping therapy, and six had an \nincrease in Ph -positive metaphases.405 At 18 months after resuming \ntherapy, all nine patients had achieved a CHR but only three females \nachieved a CCyR and none had achieved an MMR. In another series \nthat reported the outcomes of seven patients who were not in DMR at \nthe time imatinib was stop ped because of pregnancy, three were in an \nMMR.406 All seven patients had disease relapse. The three who had an \nMMR at the time imatinib was stopped could regain the same response \nonce the drug was restarted, whereas the remaining four patients did \nnot.  \nPlanning a Pregnancy  \nIn patients assigned male at birth, the general recommendation is that \nTKI therapy need not be discontinued if a pregnancy is planned. \nHowever, experience is limited. Sperm banking can also be performed prior to starting TKI therapy, but there are no data regarding quality of \nsperm in males with untreated CML.   \nIn patients assigned female at birth, due to the risk of miscarriage and fetal abnormalities during pregnancy, TKI therapy should be stopped \nprior to natural conception and patients should remain off therapy during \npregnancy.\n398- 400  \nFertility preservation should be discussed with all patients of childbearing \nage prior to the initiation of TKI therapy. Referral to an in vitro fertilization \n(IVF) center is recommended in coordination with the patient’s \nobstetrician. TKI should be stopped prior to attempting oocyte retrieval, \nbut the optimal timing of discontinuation is unknown. There are no data \nto recommend how long a patient should be off therapy before oocyte \nretrieval, although usually at least 1 month off therapy is recommended.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-28 In addition to the high incidence of disease recurrence off TKI therapy, \npatients should also be made aware of the significant obstacles related \nto IVF (eg, lack of access to centers that perform the procedure, high \ncosts associated with drugs, surgical pr ocedures and embryo/oocyte \nstorage that may not be covered by insurance, variable access to surrogate programs, the need to take family medical leave from work to \nattend IVF appointments).  \nPrior to attempting pregnancy, patients and their partners should be \ncounseled that no guidelines exist regarding how best to monitor CML \nduring pregnancy, nor how best to manage progressive disease should it \noccur during pregnancy. Referral to a CML speci alty center and \nconsultation with a high -risk obstetrician is recommended.   \nTreatment and Monitoring During Pregnancy  (CML -E) \nMost of the literature regarding treatment during pregnancy consists of \ncase reports. TKI therapy, particularly during the first trimester, should be \navoided because of teratogenic risk. If TKI therapy is considered during \npregnancy, the potential benefit for the mother and the potential risk to \nthe fetus of continuing TKI therapy versus the risk of treatment interruption leading to the loss of optimal disease response must be \ncarefully evaluated on an individual basis.  \nLeukapheresis can be used for a rising white blood cell (WBC) count \nand/or platelet count, although there are no data that recommend at what \nlevel leukapheresis and/or platelet pheresis should be initiated.\n411- 414 \nLow-dose aspirin or low -molecular -weight heparin can be considered for \npatients with thrombocytosis.415,416  \nThe Panel also recommends against the use of hydroxyurea during \npregnancy, especially in the first trimester.417- 419 Most of the data using \ninterferons during pregnancy have been reported in patients with essential \nthrombocythemia; if treatment is needed during pregnancy, it is preferable to initiate treatment with interferon alfa -2a.408,420- 422 \nPeginterferon alfa -2a and ropeginterferon alfa -2b are available for \nclinical use in the United States.  If introduced earlier, the use of \npeginterferon alfa -2a can preserve molecular remission after \ndiscontinuation of TKI.423,424 There are very limited data for the use of \nropeginterferon alfa -2b in patients with CML during pregnancy.   \nMonthly monitoring of CBC with differential and frequent monitoring with \nqPCR (every 1 –3 months) would be helpful to guide the timing for \ninitiation of TKI therapy, although specific thresholds for treatment \nreinitiation have not been defined.  \nBreastfeeding  (CML -E) \nTKI therapy can be restarted after delivery. However, patients on TKI \ntherapy should be advised not to breastfeed, as TKIs pass into human \nbreast milk.425- 428 Breastfeeding without TKI therapy may be safe with \nmolecular monitoring, preferably in those patients with CML who have durable DMR. It may be acceptable to avoid TKIs for the short period of \nthe first 2 to 5 days after labor to give the child colostrum.\n428,429  \nClose molecular monitoring is recommended for females who extend the \ntreatment -free period for breastfeeding. If the loss of MMR after \ntreatment cessation is confirmed, breastfeeding needs to be terminated and TKI should be restarted.\n428  \nSpecific Considerations for Children with CML \nCML accounts for <3% of all pediatric leukemias. In general, children are \ndiagnosed at a median age of 11 to 12 years, with approximately 10% \npresenting in advanced phase;  favorable outcome has been reported in \npediatric patients presenting with de novo advanced phase CML treated \nwith TKI therapy .430  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  1.2026  \nChronic Myeloid Leukemia   \n \nMS-29 Due to its rarity, there are no evidence -based recommendations for the \nmanagement of CML in the pediatric population. Many pediatric \noncologists follow treatment guidelines that are designed for adult \npatients. However, clinical presentations and host factors are different \nbetween children and adults, and several factors should be considered \nwhen treating pediatric patients with CML.431  \nSelection of TKI  \nBosutinib, dasatinib , imatinib , and nilotinib  (capsules)  are approved for \ntreatment of CML in children.432- 434 Bosutinib is approved based on the \nresults of the BCHILD trial (published only as an abstract) . Higher dose \nimatinib (340 mg/m²) has also been shown to be effective and well \ntolerated in children.435- 437 There are very little data on the safety and \nefficacy of ponatinib  and asciminib  in children.438  \nThe validity of prognostic scores (eg, Sokal, Euro) for risk assessment or \nto make treatment decisions has not been established in the pediatric \npopulation.439 The ELTS score has demonstrated better differentiation of \nPFS than Sokal and Euro scores in children treated with imatinib.440  \nMonitoring for Long -Term Side Effects  \nChildren have a much longer life expectancy than adults , and TKI therapy \nmay be needed for many decades; therefore, there are potential long- term \nside effects (such as delayed growth, changes in bone metabolism, thyroid \nabnormalities, and effects on puberty and fertility) that may not be seen in \nadults.441  \nA number of studies have reported impaired longitudinal growth in children \nwith CML treated with TKI therapy, and the effect is more significant when \ntreatment was initiated during prepubertal age.442- 448 Growth should be \nmonitored closely, and a bone age x -ray should be obtained if longitudinal \ngrowth is delayed. A dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan should be obtained if bone mineral density is decreased on plain \nradiograph or if there is unprovoked fracture. Further evaluation and \nreferral to an endocrinologist is also warranted.  \nThe feasibility of discontinuation of imatinib in children in sustained DMR for ≥2 years has been demonstrated in small studies.\n449- 451 Further studies \nin a larger cohort of patients are needed to identify the criteria for discontinuation of TKI therapy in children. Therefore, discontinuation of \nTKI therapy in children is not recommended outside the context of a \nclinical trial.  \nImmunizations \nThere are little data regarding the long- term impact of TKIs on the immune \nfunction of patients with CML receiving TKI therapy. Available evidence suggests that TKI therapy could potentially hinder routine immunization \nwith some vaccines in adults and children with CML.\n452- 454 A study that \nevaluated the safety and efficacy of H1N1 influenza vaccine in patients \nwith hematologic malignancies  showed a higher seroconversion rate in \nadult patients with CML compared to patients with B -cell malignancies or \nrecipients  of HCT .452 The findings from another study that evaluated the \nimpact of TKI therapy on B -cell responses to vaccination in patients with \nCML suggest that TKI therapy with dasatinib, imatinib, or nilotinib is \nassociated with impaired B- cell response to polysaccharide pneumococcal \n(PPS) vaccine due to the off -target inhibition of kinases involved in B -cell \nsignaling pathway.453    \nIn general, the use of inactivated killed vaccines for children on TKI \ntherapy is safe, although it is unknown whether responses are comparable \nto those seen in healthy children. Administration of live vaccines during \nTKI therapy is not recommended in general, although preliminary findings \nfrom a few case reports have shown that MMR and varicella vaccine could \nbe safely given to some children with immune deficiency.454,455 Live PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:35:08 PM.
