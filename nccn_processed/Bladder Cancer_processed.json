Thiotepa does not appear to be effective.3\n• Immediate postoperative intravesical chemotherapy reduces the 5-year recurrence rate by approximately 35% and has a number needed to \ntreat to prevent a recurrence of 7. However, it does not reduce the risk of progression or the risk of cancer mortality.3 \n• It is not effective in patients with an elevated EORTC recurrence risk score (≥5). This includes patients with ≥8 tumors and those with \n≥1 recurrence per year.\n• Most efficacious in patients with low-grade, low-volume Ta urothelial cancer.\n• Contraindications include: bladder perforation, known drug allergy.\nInduction (Adjuvant) Intravesical Chemotherapy or BCG\n• Treatment option for NMIBC.\n• The most commonly used agents are BCG, mitomycin, and gemcitabine.\n• Initiated 3–4 weeks after TURBT with or without maintenance.\n• Weekly instillations during induction are given for approximately 6 weeks.\n• Maximum of 2 consecutive cycle inductions without complete response.\n• Withhold if traumatic catheterization, bacteriuria, persistent gross hematuria, persistent severe local symptoms, or systemic symptoms.\nMaintenance Intravesical BCG\n• Although there is no standard regimen for maintenance BCG, many NCCN Member Institutions follow the SWOG regimen consisting of a \n6-week induction course of BCG followed by maintenance with 3 weekly instillations at months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36.4\n• Ideally maintenance should be given for 1 year for intermediate-risk and 3 years for high-risk NMIBC.\n• BCG would be withheld if traumatic catheterization, bacteriuria, persistent gross hematuria, persistent severe local symptoms, or systemic \nsymptoms.\n• Dose reduction is encouraged if there are substantial local symptoms during maintenance therapy.\n• Data suggest the benefit of maintenance BCG therapy through a decreased rate of recurrence for NMIBC.4\nContinued\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

Topical chemotherapeutic agents are \ndelivered by instillation. Administration can be percutaneous or through a retrograde approach using a catheter. There is no standard \nregimen and patients should be referred to an institution with experience in this treatment or a clinical trial.\n• Topical immunotherapy and chemotherapy management\n\u0017BCG, mitomycin\n\u0017Route of administration might include percutaneous antegrade (preferred) or retrograde ureteral catheters.\n\u0017Induction and maintenance therapy regimens, similar to intravesical therapy, can be used.\nPostsurgical Intraprostatic BCG for Urothelial Carcinoma of the Prostate\n• Treatment for patients with ductal + acini, or prostatic urethra involvement. See Urothelial Carcinoma of the Prostate (UCP-1).\n• Induction (adjuvant) therapy should be initiated 3–4 weeks after TURP.\n• Induction BCG should be followed with maintenance BCG.\n• Data indicate a reduction in recurrence in the prostate in patients with superficial disease.5-11\nPostsurgical Intraurethral Therapy for Primary Carcinoma of the Urethra\n• Consider as primary treatment for select patients with CIS, Ta, or T1 disease. See Primary Carcinoma of the Urethra (PCU-2) .\n• Induction (adjuvant) therapy should be initiated 3–4 weeks after TUR.\n• The most commonly used agents are BCG, mitomycin, and gemcitabine.\n• Role of maintenance in this context is uncertain.\n• Efficacy of this treatment in primary carcinoma of the urethra has not been established.\nIntrapelvic and Intravesical Therapy for Upper Tract Tumors\n• Primary Therapy\n\u0017Complete or near complete endoscopic resection or ablation is recommended prior to mitomycin ureteral gel application, which is most \nsuitably indicated for a residual, low-grade, low-volume (5–15 mm), solitary tumor in the upper urinary tract for a patient who is not a \ncandidate for or not seeking nephroureterectomy as a definitive treatment. Mitomycin for pyelocaliceal application may be administered via \nureteral catheter or a nephrostomy tube.\n• Postsurgical Therapy\n\u0017Consider intrapelvic therapy for patients with non-metastatic, low-grade tumors of the renal pelvis. See Upper GU Tract Tumors: Renal \nPelvis (UTT-1).\n ◊Intrapelvic induction (adjuvant) therapy should be initiated 3–4 weeks after endoscopic resection.\n ◊The most commonly used agents for intrapelvic therapy are BCG, mitomycin C, and gemcitabine.\n ◊Role of maintenance following intrapelvic therapy in this context is uncertain.\n ◊Efficacy of intrapelvic therapy in upper urinary tract cancer has not been established.12-14\n\u0017Perioperative intravesical chemotherapy should be strongly considered following nephroureterectomy with cuff of bladder resection as \nrandomized trials have shown a decrease in intravesical recurrence.15-18\nReferencesPRINCIPLES OF INSTILLATION THERAPYPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

Better dose adherence may be achieved with fewer delays in dosing using the 21-day schedule.12\n• Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is preferred for patients with UTUC, particularly for higher stage and/or grade tumors or concerning radiographic findings, as renal function will \ndecline after nephroureterectomy and may preclude adjuvant therapy.\n\u0017Multicenter data support the use of neoadjuvant, split-dose cisplatin-based chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) for patients with high-grade UTUC.13 Staging for \nUTUC is less precise than for bladder cancers and understaging is common, necessitating discussion on the risk of under- versus over-treatment. \n\u0017Adjuvant therapy should be considered if neoadjuvant therapy was not given for UTUC.14\n• Carboplatin should not be substituted for cisplatin in the perioperative bladder cancer setting.\n\u0017For patients with borderline renal function or minimal dysfunction, a split-dose administration of cisplatin may be considered (such as 35 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 or days 1 \nand 8) (category 2B). While safer, the relative efficacy of the cisplatin-containing combination administered with such modifications remains undefined.\n• For patients with borderline renal function, estimate GFR to assess eligibility for cisplatin. Consider timed urine collection, which may more accurately determine eligibility \nfor cisplatin.\n• Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV nivolumab.

For patients with recurrent Ta–T1 disease usually following \nBCG therapy but without extensive CIS who are not candidates for cystectomy, concurrent chemoradiotherapy may be considered as a potentially curative \nalternative to radical cystectomy, which is the standard treatment by NCCN Guidelines.\n• Treat the whole bladder with or without pelvic nodal RT 39.6–50.4 Gy using conventional or accelerated hyperfractionation. Elective treatment to the lymph \nnodes is optional and should take into account patient comorbidities and the risks of toxicity to adjacent critical structures. Then boost either the whole \nor partial bladder between 60–66 Gy. For node-positive disease, consider boosting grossly involved nodes to the highest achievable dose that does not \nviolate dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters based on the clinical scenario. Reasonable alternatives to conventional fractionation include taking the \nwhole bladder to 55 Gy in 20 fractions, or using simultaneous integrated boosts to sites of gross disease.\n• When irradiating the bladder only or bladder tumor boost, consider daily image guidance.\n• Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is recommended for added tumor cytotoxicity , and can be given without significant increased toxicity over RT alone. \nConcurrent 5-FU and mitomycin C or low-dose gemcitabine can be used instead of cisplatin-containing regimens in patients with low or moderate renal \nfunction. Such therapy is optimally given by dedicated multidisciplinary teams.\n• Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (preferred) or RT alone should be considered as potentially curative therapy for patients who are medically inoperable. \nConcurrent chemoradiotherapy or RT alone should be considered for local palliation in patients with metastatic disease.\n• When giving palliative radiation for metastatic bladder cancer or for recurrent pelvic tumor, combining radiation with radiosensitizing chemotherapy should \nbe considered. See BL-G 5 of 7  for agents. Chemotherapy should not be used concurrently with high-dose (>3 Gy per fraction) palliative radiation.\n• Treatment field should include whole bladder and all sites of gross disease plus or minus uninvolved regional lymph nodes. Regional lymph nodes include \nthe hypogastric, obturator, internal and external iliac, perivesical, sacral, and presacral nodes. For involved nodal disease, the common iliac nodes are a \nsite of secondary involvement.\n• For patients with pT3/pT4 pN0–2 urothelial (pure urothelial or primary urothelial mixed with other subtypes) bladder cancer following radical cystectomy \nwith ileal conduit, consider postoperative adjuvant pelvic RT (category 2B). T reatment field should encompass areas at risk for harboring residual \nmicroscopic disease based on pathologic findings at resection and may include cystectomy bed and pelvic lymph nodes with doses in the range of 45 to \n50.4 Gy. Involved resection margins and areas of extranodal extension could be boosted to 54–60 Gy if feasible based on normal tissue constraints.\n• Conduct tumor status assessment after completion of full-dose primary chemoradiotherapy. See Table 7 on BL-E 5 of 6.\n• In highly selected T4b tumor cases, may consider intraoperative RT.\n• Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is generally most suitable for patients with solitary tumors, negative nodes, no extensive or multifocal CIS, no moderate/\nsevere tumor-related hydronephrosis, and good pre-treatment bladder function.\n• For palliative RT, consider a dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 21 Gy in 3 fractions.\n• A meta-analysis of individual patient data from two randomized phase III studies (BC2001 and BCON) found that a hypofractionated schedule of 55 Gy in \n20 fractions over 4 weeks is noninferior to the standard fractionation schedule of 64 Gy in 32 fractions over 6.5 weeks for both invasive local control and \ntoxicity and that the hypofractionated schedule is superior regarding invasive local control.\nContinued\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion\nPRINCIPLES OF ALTERNATIVE RISK CLASSIFIERS AND BIOMARKERS \n• A physician’s expertise and patient's preferences are critical when considering the diagnosis of bladder cancer, frequency of surveillance, \nand treatment intensification or deintensification decisions. The NCCN Guidelines provide an evidence-based expert consensus that applies \nto most patients, but cannot capture all the nuances of any individual patient case. The NCCN Bladder Cancer Panel acknowledges that \nrisk classifiers may provide additional prognostic information for estimating the risk of various outcomes after diagnosis or treatment.  \nThese risk classifiers include, but are not limited to, staging systems derived from routinely available clinical information and nomograms, \ncommercially available molecular tests, radiologic evaluations, and emerging artificial intelligence models. These risk classifiers should be \nrestricted to use in cases where there is concern that delivering guideline-directed practices or therapy may lead to over- or under-treatment \nor unacceptable toxicity.  \nPrognostic Biomarkers\n• Since prognostic biomarkers are agnostic to the treatments received, evidence supporting their use may be derived from retrospective \nstudies, prospective registries, or prospective clinical trials. The NCCN Bladder Cancer Panel has elected not to list all the available and \nemerging prognostic risk classifiers, regardless of the evidence level. The Panel encourages physicians and patients to carefully weigh \nthe quality and size of the studies that led to their development and validation when using them as clinical tools to aid in determining the \nfrequency of surveillance monitoring, treatment intensification, or deintensification decisions. T o be clinically useful, the test should inform \nthe patient of the absolute risk of the event of interest (eg, metastasis or progression). Prognostic biomarkers may be used in considering \ntreatment intensification or deintensification decisions.\nPredictive Biomarkers\n• Predictive biomarkers inform decisions on whether specific interventions may be beneficial, futile, or harmful, regardless of the absolute \nrisk. To be classified as a predictive biomarker, a risk classifier must prove that a change in management alters the risk of an outcome of \ninterest. To do so, the risk classifier must be tested in data derived from prospectively randomized trials, where the randomization question \nwas the management change, and the pre-specified endpoints of the trial were the outcome of interest.  \nBL-I\n1 OF 3PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion\nDisease Contexts\n• Germline Testing\n\u0017The Panel recommends inquiring about the family and personal history of cancer and known germline variants at the time of initial \ndiagnosis. The criteria for germline testing should be reviewed at the time of the initial diagnosis and, if relevant, at recurrence.\n• Non–Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)\n\u0017Biomarkers have a limited role in the initial evaluation and management of NMIBC. Any suspected patient with bladder cancer should \nundergo cystoscopy, TURBT, and EUA for diagnosis/disease risk stratification, which will drive subsequent treatment options offered to \npatients.\n\u0017Office cystoscopy at recommended intervals is a critical diagnostic and surveillance tool for NMIBC. Omission or delay of cystoscopy is \nacceptable only if a predictive biomarker has been tested and found to be non-inferior in a prospective randomized clinical trial.\n\u0017Currently, there is no routine role for obtaining urine cytology or other urinary biomarkers in low-risk NMIBC.a\n\u0017The ability of biomarkers to replace urine voided cytology, most notably in the surveillance of NMIBC (in the intermediate or greater risk \nstratification groups), remains uncertain, and randomized clinical trials are required to conclusively address such questions.\n\u0017The use of certain biomarkers can be considered in the evaluation and workup of gross hematuria, but this is outside the scope of this \nguideline.\n\u0017Biomarkers have the greatest clinical value in the further evaluation of patients with subjective findings at the time of office cystoscopy \n(eg, focal or diffuse redness raising concern most notably in a patient with previous intravesical treatment that could explain such findings) \nor in the context of abnormal voided cytology (most notably when the upper tract diagnostic imaging evaluation is negative). However , we \nleave this to the discretion and clinical judgment of board-certified practicing urologists to determine if and when such biomarkers may be \nclinically used in their practice.\n• Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC)/Resectable:\n\u0017The Panel does not recommend routine somatic tumor testing unless it enables a patient to be considered for an available clinical trial.\n\u0017The Panel recognizes that some ultrasensitive circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays may have prognostic value after cystectomy. \nHowever, to date, the Panel has concluded that there are insufficient data for ctDNA results to determine the course of surveillance or \ntherapy after complete surgical resection.PRINCIPLES OF ALTERNATIVE RISK CLASSIFIERS AND BIOMARKERS \nBL-I\n2 OF 3a See AUA Risk Stratification for Non–Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer definitions on BL-2.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

Somatic tumor testing assays should cover FGFR3 alterations. A larger panel may be preferred to \nidentify rare mutations that may have approved therapies or allow for clinical trial eligibility.\n\u0017The Panel recommends evaluation of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and/or mismatch repair (MMR) status.\n\u0017The Panel recommends immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing for HER2.\n• Advanced Disease\n\u0017 Studies have demonstrated that ultrasensitive ctDNA assays may track the response to therapy and progression. However, there are \ninsufficient data that changes in therapy based on ctDNA significantly improve outcomes. Additionally, there are no data to date that ctDNA \nclearance should be used to make decisions to alter or discontinue therapy.\nBL-I\n3 OF 3b Molecular/genomic testing in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved laboratory, including FGFR RGQ reverse transcriptase polymerase \nchain reaction (RT-PCR) for FGFR3 genetic alterations and IHC for HER2 overexpression.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nMS-2 \nOverview  \nAn estimated 83,190  new cases of urinary bladder cancer ( 63,070  \nmales and 20,120  females ) will be diagnosed in the United States in \n2024  with approximately 16,840 deaths ( 12,290 males  and 4550  \nfemales ) occurring during this same period.1 Bladder cancer, the sixth \nmost common cancer in the United States, is rarely diagnosed in \nindividuals <40 years. Given that the median age at diagnosis is 73 \nyears,2 and the associated risk factors, comorbid medical conditions  are \na frequent consideration in comprehensive care of patients with bladder \ncancer . \nRisk factors for developing bladder cancer include male sex, white race, \nsmoking, personal or family history of bladder cancer , pelvic radiation,  \nenvironmental/occupational exposures, exposure to certain \nmedications , chronic infection or irritation of the urinary tract, and \ncertain medical conditions including obesity and diabetes.3-6 While \ndiabetes mellitus appears to be associated with an elevated risk of \ndeveloping bladder cancer,4 treatment with metformin may be \nassociated with improved prognosis  in patients with bladder cancer and \ndiabetes .7 Certain genetic syndromes, most notably Lynch syndrome, \nmay also predispose an individual to urothelial carcinoma.8 \nThe clinical spectrum of bladder cancer can be divided into three \ncategories that differ in prognosis, management, and therapeutic aims. \nThe first category consists of non– muscle -invasive bladder cancer  \n(NMIBC), for which treatment is directed at reducing recurrences and \npreventing progression to a more advanced stage, while minimizing \nadverse events (AEs) related to treatment . The second group \nencompasses muscle invasive , non -metastatic  disease. Unlike NMIBC, \nmuscle  invasive disease poses a much greater risk for progression and \nrequires more aggressive therapy , often a multidisciplinary approach \nincluding a combination of systemic therapy, surgery, and/or radiation. The critical concern for the third group, consisting of metastatic lesions, \nis how to prolong survival  and m aintain quality of life. Numerous agents \nwith different mechanisms of action have antitumor effects on this \ndisease. The goal is to use these agents to increase survival and quality \nof life . \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the D evelopment and Update of the NCCN  \nClinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) are \navailable at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines® for Bladder \nCancer , an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to \nobtain key literature using the following search terms : bladder  cancer \nOR urothelial carcinoma of the ureter OR urothelial carcinoma of the prostate OR primary carcinoma of the urethra.  The PubMed database \nwas chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for medical \nliterature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.\n9  \nThe search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, \nPhase IV ; Guideline; Meta- Analysis; Randomized Controlled Trial s; \nSystematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key PubMed articles as well as  articles from additional sources deemed as \nrelevant to these Guidelines  as discussed by the panel during the \nGuidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion \nsection. Recommendations for which high -level evidence is  lacking are \nbased on the panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nMS-3 \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.10 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to \nuse language that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -\nclassist, anti -misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -\nbiased; and inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, \ninstead focusing on organ- specific recommendations. This language is \nboth more accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the \nneeds of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identit ies. \nNCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from \norganizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies \ndo not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these \nterms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate \ngender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is \npresumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN \nencourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies \nand organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their \nfuture analyses.  \nClinical Presentation and Workup \nThe most common presenting symptom in patients with bladder cancer \nis microscopic or gross hematuria, although urinary frequency due to \nirritation or reduced bladder capacity can also develop. Less commonly , \nthe presenting symptom is  a urinary tract infection . Upper tract \nobstruction or pain may occur in patients with a more advanced lesion. \nPatients present ing with these symptoms should be evaluated with  \noffice cystoscopy to determine if  a lesion is present. Enhanced \ncystoscopy may be used if available. If a lesion  is documented, the \npatient should be scheduled for a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of disease within the bladder.  Urine cytology may also be obtained around \nthe time of cystoscopy.  Because smoking is a major risk factor for \nbladder cancer,\n11 screening for sm oking and initiation of treatment  for \nsmoking cessation, if appropriate, is recommended during the initial \nevaluation (see NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation).   \nEvidence has suggested that bladder cancer has a substantial hereditary component, including a high prevalence of Lynch syndrome \nin patients with urothelial carcinoma.\n8,12 Therefore, it is recommended to \ntake a thorough family history for all patients with bladder cancer  and \nconsider germline testing and referral to a genetic counselor for those \nwho are at higher  risk of Lynch syndrome based on younger age at \npresentation and/or a personal or family history of Lynch syndrome-\nrelated cancers  (see NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High -Risk \nAssessment: Colorectal  for information on the criteria and strategies for \nevaluation of Lynch syndrome ). \nA CT scan  or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis is recommended before \nthe TURBT, as long as it is logistically feasible,  to allow for better \nanatomical characterization of the lesion and possible delineation of the \nsuspected depth of invasion.  Additional workup for all patients should \ninclude consideration of urine cytology , if not already tested,  and \nevaluation of the upper tracts with a CT or MR urography; a renal \nultrasound or CT without contrast with retrograde ureteropyelography;  a \nureteroscopy; or a combination of techniques . CT urography is \ngenerally the preferred approach to upper tract imaging in patients who \ncan safely receive intravenous contrast agents.  \nTURBT with a bimanual examination under anesthesia (EUA) is \nperformed to resect visible tumor and to sample muscle within the area \nof the tumor to assess invasion. In a case where the tumor is clearly not \ninvasive (eg, multiple small papillary tumors), EUA would not be PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

The goal of TURBT is to correctly identify the clinical stage \nand grade of disease while completely resecting all visible tumor. \nTherefore, an adequate sample that includes bladder muscle (ie, \nmuscularis propria) preferentially should be obtained in the resection \nspecimen, most notably in high- grade disease. A small fragment of \ntumor with few muscle fibers is inadequate for assessing the depth of \ninvasion and guiding treatment recommendations. When a large \npapillary lesion is noted, more than one session may be needed to \ncompletely resect the tumor. With  carcinoma in situ ( CIS), biopsy of \nsites adjacent to the tumor and multiple random biopsies may be \nperformed  to assess for a field change. Single -dose intravesical \ngemcitabine or mitomycin (both category 1 , although gemcitabine is \npreferred due to better tolerability  and lower cost ) within 24 hours of \nTURBT is recommended  if non-muscle  invasive  disease is suspected \n(see Intravesical Therapy) . Existing data support this approach largely \nfor low -volume, low -grade disease.13-15 \nMapping or  random biopsies of normal -appearing urothelium rarely yield \npositive results  and lack sensitivity for CIS , especially for low -risk \ntumors.16-19 In addition, these biopsies often cause additional damage to \nthe bladder without benefit to the patient. Therefore, mapping biopsies \nof normal -appearing urothelium are not recommended for most patients.  \nPositive urinary cytology may indicate urothelial tumor anywhere in the urinary tract.  In the presence of a positive cytology and a normal \ncystoscopy, the  upper tracts and the prostate (prostatic urethra)  must \nbe evaluated  and ureteroscopy may be considered.  \nClinical investigation of the specimen obtained by TURBT or biopsy is \nan important step in the diagnosis and subsequent management of \nbladder cancer. The modifier “c” before the stage refers to clinical \nstaging based on bimanual EUA , endoscopic surgery (biopsy or TURBT) , and imaging studies. A modifier “p” would refer to pathologic \nstaging based on cystectomy and lymph node dissection.  \nPathology and Staging \nThe most commonly used staging system is the tumor, node, \nmetastasis ( TNM ) staging system  by the AJCC20 (see Staging in the \nalgorithm).  The NCCN Guidelines® for Bladder Cancer divide treatment \nrecommendations for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder according to \nnon-muscle  invasive disease (Ta, T1, and CIS ) and muscle invasive \ndisease (≥T2 disease). Management of bladder cancer is based on the \nfindings of the biopsy and TURBT specimens , with attention to \nhistology, grade, and depth of invasion. These factors are used to estimate the probability of recurrence and progression to a more \nadvanced stage.  Patient bladder function, comorbidities, and life \nexpectancy are also important considerations.  \nApproximately  75% of newly detected cases are non -muscle  invasive \ndisease—e xophytic papillary tumors confined largely to the mucosa \n(Ta) (70% –75%) or , less often , to the lamina propria (T1) ( 20%–25%)  or \nflat high- grade lesions (CIS, 5% –10%) .\n21 These tumors tend to be \nfriable and have a high propensity for bleeding. Their natural history is \ncharacterized by a tendency to recur in the bladder , and these \nrecurrences can either be at the same stage as the initial tumor or at a \nmore advanced stage.  While not fully endorsed by the AJCC staging  \nsystem, there are data to support that pT1 sub- staging may have \nprognostic value, with microscopic or focal invasion into the lamina \npropria showing better outcomes than more extensive pT1 disease.22-24 \nIf feasible, pT1 sub -staging may be useful for prognostication, although \nit is currently not widely utilized  and relies on specialized pathology \nreview , which may not be available at all centers.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nMS-5 \nPapillary tumors confined to the mucosa or submucosa are generally \nmanaged endoscopically with  complete resection. Progression to a \nmore advanced stage may result in local symptoms or, less commonly, symptoms related to metastatic disease.  An estimated 31 % to 78 % of \npatients with a tumor confined to the mucosa or submucosa will \nexperience a recurrence or new occurrence of urothelial carcinoma \nwithin 5 years.\n25 These probabilities of recurrence  vary as a function of \nthe initial stage and grade, size, and multiplicity . Refining these \nestimates for individual patient s is an area of active research.  \nMuscle  invasive disease (T2) is defined by malignant extension into the \ndetrusor muscle while perivesical tissue involvement defines T3 \ndisease. Extravesical invasion into the surrounding organs (ie, the \nprostatic stroma, seminal vesicles, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, \nabdominal wall) delineates T4 disease.  The depth of invasion is the \nmost important determinant of prognosis and treatment  for localized \nbladder cancer . \nThe 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual includes changes to \nthe staging of urinary bladder carcinoma, including the subdivision of \nstages III and IV disease (stage III into stage IIIA and stage IIIB; stage \nIV into stage IVA and stage IVB).20 Notably, the new staging system \ngroups T1– T4a, N1 within stage IIIA and T1– T4a, N2– 3 within stage \nIIIB; N1 –3 was previously grouped within stage IV, regardless of T \nstage.20,26 The NCCN Guidelines for Bladder Cancer were updated to \nreflect appropriate treatment options based on this new staging system (see Treatment of Stage II and IIIA Tumors , Treatment of Stage IIIB \nTumors , and Treatment of Stage IVA Tumors ). \nEnhanced Cystoscopy  \nWhite light cystoscopy (WLC)  is the current standard in the evaluation \nand staging of bladder cancer. While WLC has a high sensitivity for detecting papillary lesions, the technique is limited in its ability to \ndiscern non -papillary and flat lesions from inflammatory lesions, thus \nreducing the accuracy of tumor staging. Additionally, small or multifocal \nlesions are more difficult to detect wi th WLC. Several techniques \nproposed to enhance imaging are available and include blue light cystoscopy (BLC) and narr ow-band imaging (NBI). Both methods report \nimproved staging when used in conjunction with WLC and expertise; however, data are still limited for both methods and WLC remains the \nmainstay of bladder cancer staging.  \nBlue Light Cystoscopy  \nBLC is a technique that identifies malignant cells through the absorption \nof the photosensitizing drug into the urothelial cytoplasm where it enters  \nthe heme  biosynthesis pathway.  In normal cells, the photosensitizer is \nexcreted; however, enzymatic abnormalities in malignant cells result in \nthe formation of photoactive porphyrins that remain in the cell and \nfluoresce with a red emission in the presence of blue light. Earlier \nstudies used the photosensitizer 5 -aminolevulinic acid (5- ALA), \nalthough more recen t studies use only the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration ( FDA)-approved photosensitizer hexyl -aminolevulinate \n(HAL).  \nSeveral prospective clinical studies have evaluated BLC in conjunction \nwith WLC and found higher detection rates of non- muscle  invasive \nlesions with BLC.27-32 Particularly CIS, which is often missed by WLC, \nwas detected at a higher rate. A meta -analysis of BLC TURBT in \nNMIBC included 12 randomized controlled trials with a total of 2258 \npatients.33 A lower recurrence rate was observed ( overall response \n[OR], 0.5; P  < .00001) with a delayed time to first recurrence by 7.39 \nweeks ( P < .0001). Recurrence -free survival  (RFS)  was improved at 1 \nyear ( hazard ratio [ HR], 0.69; P < .00001) and at 2 years (HR, 0.65; PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

However, no significant reduction in the rate of progression \nto muscle invasive bladder cancer was seen (OR, 0.85; P  = .39).  \nIn a meta -analysis from Burger et al,34 1345 patients with Ta, T1,  or CIS \ndisease showed improved detection of bladder tumors and a reduction \nin recurrence.34 Compared to WLC, BLC detected more Ta tumors \n(14.7%; P < .001; OR, 4.898; 95% CI, 1.937– 12.390) and CIS lesions \n(40.8%; P < .001; OR, 12.372; 95% CI, 6.343– 0.924). Importantly, \n24.9% of patients had at least one additional Ta/T1 tumor detected \n(P < .001) , and improved detection was seen in both primary (20.7%; \nP < .001) and recurrent disease (27.7%; P  < .001). Another review of \nthe literature included 26 studies with 5 -ALA, 15 studies with HAL, and \ntwo studies that used both methodologies. The results from this review \nalso support greater detection and reduced recurrence but no reduction \nin disease progression.35 \nAlthough most studies have found no significant reduction in disease \nprogression, a recent  analysis reported a trend towards a lower rate \nwith the use of BLC compared to WLC (12.2% vs. 17.6%, respectively; \nP = .085) with a longer time to progression ( P = .05).36 Although BLC \nhas demonstrated  improved detection and reduced recurrence,  the \nvalue of this technique in reducing disease progression remains less \nestablished. Therefo re, BLC may have the greatest advantage in \ndetecting difficult -to-visualize tumors (eg, CIS tumors) that may be \nmissed by WLC but has more limited applicability  in disease monitoring. \nOther impediments to BLC include the need for appropriate expertise \nand equipment to use this new technology.  High false positives are also \nattributed to this method and may be increased in patients who have \nhad a recent TURBT or bacillus Calmette- Guérin (BCG) instillation, or \nwho have inflammation.35 The limitations of BLC require judicious \napplication of this additional diagnostic tool.  Narrow -Band Imaging  \nNBI uses two narrow bands of light at 415 nanometers and 540 \nnanometers that are absorbed by hemoglobin. The shorter wavelength \nprovides analysis of the mucosa and the longer wavelength allows for \nevaluation of the deeper submucosal blood vessels. Studies suggest \nthat there is an increase in bladder tumor detection compared wi th \nWLC, although the rate of false positives is higher.37-41  \nA systematic review and meta -analysis including seven prospective \nstudies and 1040 patients with non -muscle  invasive disease evaluated \nthe accuracy of NBI compared to WLC. In total, 1476 tumors were detected by biopsy in 611 patients. The additional detection rate for NBI \nwas higher on the patient level (17%; 95% CI, 10% –25%) and tumor \nlevel (24%; 95% CI, 17% –31%). In total, 107 patients were further \nidentified as having non- muscle  invasive disease by NBI compared to \nthe 16 patients by WLC. Similarly, 276 additional tumors were reported in five studies using NBI versus 13 additional tumors by WLC. Although \nindividual studies demonstrated an increase in the rate of false positives, the meta- analysis reported no statistical significance. \nHowever, it was acknowledged that data are limited due to the relatively \nnew application of this technique and interpretation is impeded by the \ndegree of heterogeneity among the studies. Finally, the meta- analysis \nwas unable to determine if there was a long- term advantage of NB I, as \nmeasured by a reduction in recurrence or progression.  \nA randomized prospective trial followed patients for 1 year after NBI - or \nWLC -guided transurethral resection (TUR) to evaluate recurrence. NBI \nhad a reduced 1 -year recurrence rate (32.9%; 25 of 76 patients) \ncompared to WLC (32.9% vs. 51.4%, respectively; O R, 0.62).\n42 \nHowever, the small number of patients in this study is limiting.

This study found that while \nrecurrence rates were similar between the two groups in the study \npopulation overall, NBI -guided TUR significantly reduced the likelihood \nof disease recurrence at 1 year in patients  with low- risk disease  (5.6% \nfor NBI vs. 27.3% for WLC; P  = .002).43 These results are supported by \nthe systemic reviews and meta- analyses that have also shown reduced \nrecurrence rates following NBI -guided TUR compared to WLC -guided \nTUR.44,45 \nA benefit of NBI is that it does not require a contrast agent and can \ntherefore be used as part of office cystoscopy. Higher detection rates of \nflat lesions and a reduction in tumor recurrence have been reported.43-46  \nHistology \nMore than 90% of urothelial tumors originate in the urinary bladder, 8% originate in the renal pelvis, and the remaining 2% originate in the ureter \nand urethra. Urothelial carcinomas are classified as low or high grade \nas defined by the extent of cytologic  and architectural atypia .  \nNon-muscle  invasive urothelial tumors may have flat and/or  papillary \nhistology. Flat urothelial lesions may be classified as urothelial CIS, a \ntype of high- grade noninvasive urothelial carcinoma. The term urothelial \ndysplasia may be used in rare circumstances where the morphologic \nfeatures fall short for a diagnosis of CIS.  Papillary lesions may be \nbenign (ie, urothelial papilloma, inverted papilloma) or malignant. The latter group includes papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant \npotential  (PUNLMP)  and papillary urothelial carcinoma (low and high \ngrade).  In some cases, a Ta or T1 NMIBC  will have an associated \nurothelial CIS component.  \nUrothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma  is the most common histologic \nsubtype of bladder cancer  in the United States  and Europe and may \ndevelop anywhere urothelium  is present , from the renal pelvis to the ureter, bladder, and proximal two thirds of the urethra.  The fifth edition \nof the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of the \nUrinary System and Male Genital Organs, published in November 2022,  \nprovided new information into the grading of invasive urothelial \ncarcinomas, as well as noninvasive urothelial neoplasms, and the \ndefinition of precursor lesions.\n47  \nSubtype (v ariant ) histology is common with higher grades . The fifth \nedition of the WHO Classification included the adoption of a modified \nterminology where the designation of “subtype” was adopted to replace \n“variant” histology when referring to distinct morphologic categories \nwithin a given tumor type .48,49 The reasoning behind this change is that \nthe term “variant” has increasingly been used to describe genomic, \nrather than morphologic alterations, and therefore the WHO \nClassification system reserves “variant” for this purpose to avoid \nconfusion. The presence of histologic subtypes  of urothelial carcinoma \nshould be documented as data suggest that the subtype may help define the natural history and inherent  risk of progression, reflect \ndifferent genetic etiology, and subsequently determine whether a more \naggressive treatment approach should be considered (see Bladder \nCancer: Non- Urothelial and Urothelial w ith Subtype  Histology in the \nalgorithm).\n50-52 In some cases with a mixed histology, systemic \ntreatment may only target cells of urothelial origin and the non- urothelial  \ncomponent can remain.  \nSquamous cell neoplasms of the urothelial tract constitute 3% of the urinary tumors diagnosed in the United States. In regions where \nSchistosoma is endemic, this subtype is more prevalent and may \naccount for up to 75% of bladder cancer cases. The distal third of the \nurethra is dominated by squamous epithelium. The diagnosis of \nsquamous cell tumors requires the presence of keratinization in the \npathologic specimen.\n53 Squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder is PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

The three \nvariants within this subtype are pure squamous cell carcinoma, \nverrucous carcinoma, and squamous cell papilloma.  \nOther histologic subtypes  derived from cells of urothelial origin include \nglandular neoplasms, epithelial tumors of the upper urinary tract, and \ntumors arising in a bladder diverticulum. Glandular neoplasms include \nadenocarcinoma and villous adenoma. Urachal tumors are non-\nurothel ial tumors, most commonly adenocarcinomas , which arise from \nthe urachal ligament and secondarily involve the midline/dome of the bladder.\n54 Tumors arising within the genitourinary tract but that are not \nof urothelial origin (eg, tumors of Müllerian type, melanocytic tumors, \nmesenchymal tumors) are beyond the scope of these guidelines.   \nNon- Muscle Invasive Urothelial Bladder Cancer \nNon-muscle  invasive tumors were  previously referred to as superficial , \nwhich is an imprecise term that  should be avoided.  Treatment for  \nnon-muscle  invasive disease often includes intravesical therapy or , for \nthose with particularly high- risk disease , cystectomy.  \nIntravesical Therapy  \nIntravesical therapy is implemented to reduce recurrence or delay progression of bladder cancer to a higher grade or stage.  \nImmediate Intravesical Therapy Post TURBT  \nAn immediate intravesical instillation of chemotherapy may be given \nwithin 24 hours of TURBT to prevent tumor cell implantation and early \nrecurrence. Immediate intravesical chemotherapy has been shown to \ndecrease recurrence in select subgroups of patients.  A systematic \nreview and meta -analysis of 13 randomized trials demonstrated a \ndecreased risk of recurrence by 35% (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.58– 0.74; P < .001) and a decreased 5 -year recurrence rate from 58.8% to 44.8%  \nwhen comparing immediate intravesical chemotherapy following TURBT \nto TURBT alone, although the instillation did not prolong the time to \nprogression or time to death from bladder cancer .15 This study also \nfound that the instillation did not reduce recurrences in patients who had \na prior recurrence rate of greater than one recurrence per year or with a \nEuropean Organi zation for Research and Treatment of Cancer \n(EORTC)  recurrence score greater than or equal to 5.  \nPhase III trials have reported a reduced risk of recurrence for patients \nwith suspected non -muscle  invasive disease who are treated with \nimmediate postoperative gemcitabine or mitomycin.  A randomized, \ndouble- blind, phase III trial of 406 patients with suspected low -grade \nNMIBC based on cystoscopic appearance showed that immediate post -\nTURBT instillation of gemcitabine reduced the rate of recurrence \ncompared to saline instillation (placebo).13 In the intention to treat  (ITT)  \nanalysis, 35% of patients treated with gemcitabine and 47% of those \nwho received placebo had disease recurrence within 4 years (HR, 0.66; \n95% CI, 0.48– 0.90; P < .001).13 Intravesical therapy for a previous \nNMIBC was allowed in the study if received at least 6 months prior to \nenrollment. Another phase III, prospective, multicenter, randomized \nstudy of 2844 patients with NMIBC  showed that an immediate \ninstillation of mitomycin C after TURBT reduces recurrence regardless \nof the number of adjuvant instillations. Recurrence risk was 27% for \nimmediate instillation versus 36% for delayed instillation ( P < .001) for \nall patients in the study, with the benefit of immediate instillation present across risk groups.\n14 Previous intravesical chemotherapy was permitted \nin study participants as long as it was received at least 3 years prior to participation. For both studies, the rate of AEs did not significantly differ \nbetween the treatment and control groups, indicating that immediate intravesical instillation of gemcitabine or mitomycin was well \ntolerated.\n13,14 Gemcitabine is preferred over mitomycin based on toxicity  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

In addition, in systematic reviews and meta-\nanalyses, gemcitabine has shown superior efficacy compared to \nmitomycin, in that it demonstrated reduced rates of recurrence and \nprogression.57,58  \nInduction BCG has been shown to decrease the risk of  bladder cancer \nrecurrence following TURBT.

A \nprospective, randomized phase II trial compared the quality of life in patients receiving either BCG (n  = 59) or intravesical gemcitabine \n(n = 61) and found no significant difference.68 There were more frequent \nlocal and systemic side effects in the BCG arm; however, they were \nmild to moderate and the treatment was well  tolerated in both groups. \nThe benefit of BCG with or without isoniazid compared to epirubicin alone in a long- term study of 957 patients with intermediate - or high -risk \nTa or T1 disease was measured by a reduced recurrence, greater time to distant metastas es, and greater overall  survival (OS)  and \ndisease- specific survival  (DSS) ; progression was similar.\n69 Long- term \ndata comparing BCG to epirubicin in combination with interferon69,70 in \npatients with T1 disease showed a better reduction in recurrence with BCG; however, no differences in progression or AEs were seen.\n70 \nPatients in both studies received 2 to 3 years of maintenance therapy.  \nMaintenance Therapy \nMaintenance intravesical therapy may be considered following induction with chemotherapy or BCG. The role of maintenance chemotherapy is \ncontroversial. When given, maintenance chemotherapy is generally \nmonthly. The role of maintenance BCG in those patients  with \nintermediate-  to high- risk NMIBC  is more established, although the \nexact regimens have varied across studies. Some of the previous \ncontroversy over the effectiveness of BCG maintenance reflects the \nwide array of schedules and conflicting reports of efficacy.  Quarterly \nand monthly installations as well as 3-  and 6 -week schedules  have \nbeen evaluated . To date, the strongest data support the 3-week BCG \nregimen used in the SWOG trial that demonstrated reduced disease \nprogression and metastasis.\n71 The 3- week timing of BCG has shown \nimproved outcomes compared with epirubicin70 or isoniazid.69 Most \npatients receive maintenance BCG for 1 to 3 years. In an evaluation of \nrandomized controlled trials and meta -analyses, limited evidence was \nfound for 1 year of BCG maintenance.72 A study of 1355 patients with a \nmedian follow -up of 7.1 years found no benefit in 3 years of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

These data \nsuggest that 1 year may be suitable for patients at intermediate risk  \nwhile 3 years of maintenance is preferred for high -risk disease . It should \nalso be noted that duration of treatment may be  limited by toxicity and \npatient refusal to continue.  \nFor patients showing no residual disease at the follow -up cystoscopy, \nwhether 1 or 2 courses of induction therapy were administered, \nmaintenance therapy with BCG is preferred. This recommendation is \nbased on findings that an induction course of intravesical therapy \nfollowed by a maintenance regimen produced better outcomes than \nintravesical chemotherapy.56,60,61,71,74,75  \nBCG Toxicity  \nThere are concerns regarding potential ly severe local and systemic side \neffects and the inconsistent  availability of BCG. BCG induces a \nsystemic,  nonspecific , immunostimulatory response leading to  secretion \nof proinflammatory cytokines. This causes patients to experience flu- like \nsymptoms that may last 48 to 72 hours.76 Installation of BCG into the \nbladder can mimic a urinary tract infection and may produce intense \nlocal discomfort. The side effects of treatment have translated to \ndiscontinuation of BCG therapy. D ysuria has been reported in 60% of \npatients in clinical trials.76 However, the side effects are treatable in \nalmost all cases77 and no increase in toxicity has been reported with \ncumulative doses. Symptom management with single- dose, short -term \nquinolones and/or anticholinergics have been reported to reduce \nAEs.78,79  \nA reduced  (one-third) dose  of BCG was evaluated for the possible \nreduction of side effects. I n a phase III study, 1316 patients with intermediate-  or high- risk Ta, T1 papillary carcinoma of the bladder \nwere randomized to receive reduced - or full -dose BCG with either 1 or 3 \nyears of maintenance.80 Among all four  groups, the percentage of \npatients with greater than or equal to one side effect was similar \n(P = .41). Although the one -third dose of BCG was effective,  side \neffects were not reduced. Conversely, other publications suggest that the one -third dose may reduce side effects.\n81-83 Full-dose BCG is \nrecommended by the panel until more data are available to evaluate the \nlow-dose BCG regimen.  However, dose reduction may be used if there \nare substantial local symptoms during maintenance.  \nA reduction in the frequency of BCG instillations with the goal of \nreducing treatment -related AEs was tested in the phase III NIMBUS \ntrial.84 In this trial, 345 patients with NMIBC were randomized to receive \nstandard -dose BCG for 6 weeks of induction, followed by 3 weeks of \nmaintenance at 3, 6, and 12 months (15 total instillations) or standard -\ndose BCG for 3 weeks of induction, followed by 2 weeks of maintenance at 3, 6, and 12 months (9 total instillations). After 12 \nmonths of follow -up the ITT population showed a higher number of \nrecurrences in the reduced frequency treatment group (46/170) \ncompared to the standard treatment group (21/175) and a safety \nanalysis HR of 0.40, with the upper part of the one- sided 95% CI of \n0.68, meeting the predefined criteria for immediately stopping the trial due to inferiority of the reduced frequency arm.   \nBCG Shortage  \nAn ongoing shortage of BCG has existed in the United States, necessitating development of strategies to prioritize use of intravesical \nBCG and identify alternative treatment approaches for some patients \nwith NMIBC .\n85 Several organizations, including the American Urological \nAssociation (AUA), American Association of Clinical Urologists (AACU), Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (BCAN), Society of Urologic PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nMS-11 \nOncology (SUO), the Large Urology Group Practice Association \n(LUGPA) , and the Urology Care Foundation (UCF) , issued a notice  \noutlining strategies to maximize care for patients with NMIBC  in the \ncontext of this shortage.86 NCCN Panel M embers recommend several \nstrategies to help alleviate problems associated with this shortage.  \nIn the event of a BCG shortage, priority for treatment should be to \nprovide patients with high- risk NMIBC (cT1 high grade or CIS)  with \ninduction BCG . For patients who do not receive BCG, intravesical \nchemotherapy may be used as an alternative. The intravesical \nchemotherapies most commonly used for this purpose are \ngemcitabine55,87 and mitomycin.88 Two separate meta- analyses of \nrandomized trials reported that there were no differences in risk of \nrecurrence between BCG and mitomycin,56,89 although BCG may show \nmore favorable outcomes from maintenance regimens.56 Other options \ninclude epirubicin,69,90 valrubicin,91 docetaxel,92 sequential \ngemcitabine/docetaxel ,93 or gemcitabine/mitomycin.94 Another \nalternative to intravesical BCG for patients with NMIBC  at high risk of \nrecurrence and, particularly, at high risk of progression, is initial radical \ncystectomy.95 \nAnother option during a shortage is splitting the dose of BCG so that \nmultiple patients may be treated using a single vial. While several \nrandomized trials have reported that one -third-dose BCG showed \nsimilar outcomes when compared to full -dose BCG,82,96,97 a phase 3 trial \nof 1355 patients with intermediate - or high -risk NMIBC  reported that \npatients receiving the full dose of BCG show a longer disease -free \ninterval, compared with those receiving the one-third dose.73 In this \nstudy, the 5 -year disease- free rate was 58.5% for the one -third dose \ncompared to 61.7% for the full dose; therefore , the null hypothesis of \ninferiority for duration of the disease- free interval of one -third-dose BCG \ncould not be rejected (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.98– 1.35; P = .045), although there were no differences in progression or survival rates.73 Based on \nthese data, the panel recommends that one- half or one -third dose may \nbe considered for BCG induction during a  shortage and should be used \nfor BCG maintenance, if supply allows. Maintenance BCG should be prioritized for patients with high- risk NMIBC  (cT1 high grade and/or CIS) \nin the early maintenance period (eg, 3 and 6 months  post-induction) , \nalthough in cases of shortage, BCG induction therapy should be \nprioritized over maintenance BCG . \nTreatments for BCG -Unresponsive or BCG -Intolerant NMIBC  \nNadofaragene Firadenovec- vncg  \nNadofaragene firadenovec is a non- replicating adenoviral vector -based \ngene therapy that is indicated for the treatment of patients with high-\nrisk, BCG -unresponsive NMIBC  with CIS, with or without papillary \ntumors . A phase III , open- label, multicenter study evaluated \nnadofaragene firadenovec in 157 patients with BCG -unresponsive \nNMIBC.98 Of the 103 patients on the study with CIS, with or without a \nhigh- grade Ta or T1 tumor, 25 remained free of high- grade recurrence \nat 12 months (24.3% 12- month complete response rate; 95% CI, 16.4-\n33.7).  Urinary  urgency was the most common grade ≥ 3 treatment -\nrelated AE (1% of patients).  A longer -term follow- up from this same \ncohort of patients was reported on in a 2021 AUA Conference abstract \nwith a mean follow -up of 23.5 months.99 Twenty -four months after the \nfirst dose, 19.4% of patients remained free of high -grade recurrence, \nwith a median duration of high- grade RFS of 12.2 months. Of the 55 \npatients who achieved a complete response , 20 (36.4%) remained free \nof high- grade recurrence at 24 months. By 24 months, cystectomy -free \nsurvival was 64.6% and OS was 94.4%. The most common drug- related \nAEs were instillation site discharge (24.3%), fatigue (23.4%), bladder \nspasm (17.8%), and urinary  urgency (16.8%), with most AEs being \ngrades 1–2.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nMS-12 \nA second cohort of the same phase III trial detailed above included 48 \npatients with BCG -unresponsive NMIBC, high- grade Ta/T1 tumors only. \nA 2021 AUA Conference abstract reported on 2 -year follow -up results \nfrom this cohort.100 Of the 48 patients in this cohort, 72.9%, 43.8%, and \n33.3% were high -grade recurrence -free at 3, 12, and 24 months, \nrespectively. Of those who were free of high- grade recurrence at 3 \nmonths, 45.7% were high- grade recurrence -free at 24 months, with a \nmedian duration of high- grade RFS of 19.8 months. As estimated at 24 \nmonths, c ystectomy- free survival was 69.8 % and OS was 93.2% . \nNogapendekin alfa inbakicept- pmln  (N-803) \nN-803 is an immune cell -activating interleukin- 15 superagonist  that was \nstudied in combination with BCG for patients with BCG -unresponsive, \nhigh- risk NMIBC in the phase II/III QUILT -3.032 study.101 QUILT -3.032 \nincluded three cohorts of patients: those with bladder CIS, with or \nwithout Ta/T1 papillary disease, who were treated with N -803 plus BCG \n(cohort A); those with high- grade papillary Ta/T1 only disease who were \ntreated with N -803 plus BCG (cohort B); and those with bladder CIS, \nwith or without Ta/T1 papillary disease, who were treated with N -803 \nalone (cohort C). In cohort A, complete response was reported in 71% \nof 82 patients, with a median duration of complete response of 26.6 \nmonths. For the  72 patients in cohort B, DFS was 55.4% at 12 months, \nwith a median DFS of 19.3 months. For cohort C, only 2 of 10 patients \nshowed complete response after 3 months and cohort C was ultimately \ndiscontinued approximately 6 months into the study due to futili ty. Most \ntreatment -related AEs for N -803 plus BCG were grade 1 -2 (86%), 2% of \npatients treated with the combination reported at least one grade 3 \nimmune- related treatment -emergent AE. A study on patient -reported \noutcomes in the QUILT -3.032 study concluded that the combination of \nN-803 and BCG had a favorable risk to benefit ratio and quality of life \nfollowing treatment.102 Pembrolizumab for NMIBC  \nPembrolizumab is a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor \nthat has been evaluated as systemic therapy for BCG -unresponsive \nNMIBC with CIS in the single -arm, phase II KEYNOTE -057 study \n(pembrolizumab is also indicated for treatment of metastatic urothelial \ncarcinoma ; see section on Metastatic (Stage IVB) Urothelial Bladder \nCancer , below). In the KEYNOTE -057 study, 101 patients with high -risk \nCIS, with or without papillary tumor, who received previous BCG \ntherapy and were either unable or unwilling to undergo cystectomy were \ntreated with pembrolizumab.103 Ninety -six patients were eligible for \ninclusion in the efficacy analysis. The 12-month complete response rate \nwas 19% (18 of 96 total patients on the study),  and the median duration \nof response (DOR) from time of onset  was 16.2 months (95% CI, 6.7–\n36.2). Grade ≥3 treatment -related AEs were reported in 13%  of \npatients , with arthralgia and hyponatremia being the most common.  \nSerious treatment -related AEs occurred in 8% of patients.  \nCohort B of the KEYNOTE -057 study included 132 patients with high-\nrisk, BCG -unresponsive NMIBC with high- grade Ta or any -grade T1 \npapillary tumors (without CIS). A 2023 ASCO Genitourinary Cancers \nSymposium abstract reported efficacy data after a median follow -up of \n45.4 months.104 Median high- risk disease -free survival ( DFS) was 7.7 \nmonths and progression- free survival ( PFS)  to worsening of grade, \nstage, or death was 44.5 months. Thirty -one patients (23.5%) \nunderwent radical cystectomy after discontinuation of pembrolizumab.

Retrospective \nreviews have shown that the AUA/SUO risk classification accurately \nstratifies patients with NMIBC by the likelihood of recurrence and \nprogression.106  \nAfter the initial TURBT shows NMIBC, a repeat TURBT is recommended for visually incomplete or high- volume tumors and for \nhigh- grade NMIBC , which is found to be T1 on the initial TURBT.\n107 This \nis supported by a trial that prospectively randomized 142 patients with \npT1 tumors to a second TURBT within 2 to 6 weeks of the initial TURBT \nor no repeat TURBT.108 All patients received adjuvant intravesical \ntherapy. Although OS was similar, the 3 -year recurrence -free survival \nwas significantly higher in the repeat TURBT arm versus the control arm \n(69% vs. 37%, respectively), especially among patients with high- grade \ntumors.  Similarly, a randomized 10 -year extension trial of 210 patients \nwith pT1 NMIBC found that patients who underwent repeat TURBT had \na significantly higher 5- , 7-, and 10 -year RFS and PFS and, in addition, \nthe 10 -year OS rate was significantly higher in patients with repeat \nTURBT (59.1% vs. 40.8%; P = .004).109 Repeat TURBT was found to be \nan independent determinant of prolonged OS on multivariate analysis.  \nRepeat TURBT may also be considered for select patients with high -\ngrade Ta on initial TURBT , particularly if the tumor is large and/or there \nwas no muscle present in the initial TURBT specimen. Restaging \nTURBT  detected residual disease in 27% of Ta patients when muscle \nwas present in the original TURBT .110 In the absence of muscularis \npropria in the initial TURBT specimen, 49% of patients  with non-muscle  \ninvasive  disease will be understaged  versus 14% if muscle i s \npresent.111  \nIf muscle  invasive disease is found during repeat TURBT, then \nadditional staging for muscle invasive disease and appropriate \ntreatment depending on stage should be followed.  Treatment of Low -Risk NMIBC  \nBy the AUA/SUO risk stratification, low- risk NMIBC includes  PUNLMP  \nand low -grade urothelial carcinoma that is a solitary Ta and less than or \nequal to 3 cm.105 For these tumors, risk of recurrence or progression is \nlow following TURBT  and no further treatment is necessary ,112 although \na single instillation of intravesical chemotherapy immediately post -\nTURBT can be helpful in reducing the risk of recurrence .15 An \nappropriate surveillance schedule is recommended for early detection of disease recurrence.  \nTreatment of Intermediate -Risk NMIBC  \nIntermediate -risk NMIBC includes low- grade urothelial carcinoma that \nhas any of the following characteristics: T1, size greater than 3 cm , \nmultifocal, or recurrence within 1 year. In addition, high- grade urothelial \ncarcinoma that is solitary, Ta, and less than or equal to 3 cm is also \nconsidered intermediate risk.105 Although a complete TURBT alone can \neradicate intermediate- risk NMIBC, there is  a relatively high risk for \nrecurrence. Therefore, after TURBT and immediate intravesical \nchemotherapy , the panel recommends  a 6-week induction course of \nintravesical therapy. Options for intravesical therapy for intermediate-\nrisk NMIBC include BCG or  chemotherapy. The availability of BCG \nshould be considered in decision- making as it may be prioritized for \ntreatment of higher risk disease. A systematic review and meta -analysis \nhas reported that intravesical treatment with BCG does not appear \nsuperior to chemotherapy for reduction of disease recurrence in patients \nwith intermediate -risk NMIBC.113 If maintenance BCG is given following \nthe induction course, data support limiting maintenance BCG to one year for intermediate -risk disease since no additional benefit is derived \nfrom the full 3 years.\n73 While an induction course of intravesical therapy \nis preferred, surveillance is also an option  for intermediate -risk disease.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nMS-14 \nThe value of an induction course of  intravesical therapy depends on the \npatient ’s prognosis  and likelihood of disease recurrence.  Factors to \nconsider include the size,  number, T category, and grade of the \ntumor(s), as well as concomitant CIS and prior recurrence.25 \nMeta -analyses have confirmed the efficacy of adjuvant  (induction)  \nintravesical chemotherapy in reducing the risk of recurrence.114,115 In the \nliterature, there are four  meta -analyses confirming that BCG after \nTURBT is superior to TURBT alone, or TURBT and chemotherapy in \npreventing recurrences of Ta and T1 tumors.60-63 Close follow- up of all \npatients is needed, although the risk for progression to a more \nadvanced stage is low  (see Surveillance in the discussion and \nalgorithm) . \nTreatment of High -Risk NMIBC  \nHigh-risk NMIBC has  a relatively high risk for recurrence and \nprogression towards more invasiveness. According to the AUA/SUO \nrisk stratification, high -risk NMIBC includes high -grade urothelial \ncarcinoma that has any of the following characteristics: CIS, T1, size greater than 3 cm, or multifocal. In addition, a subgroup of very -high-risk \nfeatures includes BCG unresponsiveness, variant histologies, \nlymphovascular invasion, and prostatic urethral invasion.\n105 Based on \nthe histologic differentiation, m ost cT1 lesions are high grade and \nconsidered to be potentially dangerous with a higher risk for recurrence \nand progression. These tumors may occur as solitary lesions or as \nmultifocal tumors with or without an associated CIS  component.  The \npresence of CIS  is associated with an increased risk of invasive \ndisease, including increased cancer progression rates and worse \ncancer -specific outcomes.20 If untreated, 50% of CIS progresses to \nmuscle  invasive disease within 5 years and, even with treatment, 30 % \nto 40% progresses within 10 years.116  Treatment options for high -risk NMIBC depend on whether the tumor \nhas previously been shown to be unresponsive or intolerant to BCG. For BCG -naïve NMIBC, the options are cystectomy or BCG. When very \nhigh- risk features are present, cystectomy is preferred  because of the \nhigh risk for progression to a more advanced stage,\n117,118 while BCG is \npreferred when these are not present. BCG is also a category 1 \nrecommendation for BCG -naïve, high- risk NMIBC without very -high- risk \nfeatures.  A prospective study including 50  patients with high- risk, BCG -\nnaïve NMIBC randomized patients to either radical cystectomy or \ninduction, then maintenance,  BCG.119 During follow- up, two (10%) of 23 \npatients in the BCG arm developed metastatic bladder cancer, while all \nparticipants in the cystectomy arm remained disease- free.  \nFor some patients, BCG is not an option due to side effects or a tumor that is BCG -resistant. For these patients, cystectomy is preferred \nalthough other intravesical chemotherapy , N-803, pembrolizumab, or \nnadofaragene firadenovec  are other options (see Treatments for BCG -\nUnresponsive or BCG -Intolerant Disease for patient and disease \ncharacteristics for which these treatment options would be appropriate).  \nNon-cystectomy candidates with recurrent or persistent high -grade cTa \nor cT1 disease may also consider concurrent chemoradiotherapy as an \noption (category 2A for cT1, category 2B for cTa). Valrubicin is \napproved for CIS that is refractory to BCG, although panelists disagree \non its value.\n91  \nSurveillance  \nFor intermediate and high- risk NMIBC , follow- up is recommended with a \nurinary cytology and cystoscopy at 3 - to 6-month intervals for the first 2 \nyears, and at longer intervals as appropriate  thereafter. Imaging of the \nupper tract should be considered every 1 to 2 years for high- risk tumors \n(see Follow -up in the algorithm).

Considering this,  evaluati on of urinary urothelial \ntumor markers may be considered during surveillance of high- risk \nNMIBC. However, it remains unclear whether these tests offer \nadditional useful information for detection and management of \nnon-muscle  invasive bladder tumors. Therefore, the panel considers \nthis to be a category 2B recommendation.   \nFor patients  with low- risk NMIBC , if the initial follow- up surveillance \ncystoscopy is negative within 4 months of TURBT, the next cystoscopy is recommended 6 to 9 months later and then yearly for up to 5 years. \nFollow- up cystoscopy after 5 years should only be performed based on \nclinical indicat ion. Beyond baseline imaging, upper  tract imaging is not \nindicated without symptoms for patients with low -risk NMIBC .\n \nPosttreatment of Recurrent or Persistent Disease  \nTreatment of Patients with  Positive Cystoscopy \nPatients  under surveillance after initial TURBT, who show a \ndocumented recurrence by positive cystoscopy,  should undergo another  \nTURBT to reclassify the AUA/SUO risk group . Patients should be \ntreated and followed as indicated based on the risk of their recurrent \ndisease.  \nTreatment of Patients with Positive Cytology  \nIn patients without  a documented recurrence but with initial positive \ncytology and negative cystoscopy and imaging, it may be appropriate to \nrepeat the cytology test within 3 months. If subsequent cytology tests \nare positive, selected mapping biopsies including transurethral resection \nof the prostate (TURP) may be considered. In addition, the upper tract \nmust be evaluated and ureteroscopy may be considered for detecting \ntumors of the upper tract . If available, enhanced cystoscopy should be \nconsidered (see Enhanced Cystoscopy , above). With persistent positive cytology and no demonstrable clinical disease in the urinary tract, \nevaluation of the contiguous organs (eg, vagina, cervix, uterus, or \nanorectum) via referral to an appropriate specialist may be warranted. \nSeveral case reports have described the detection of urothelial \ncarcinoma spread to the vagina, cervix, or vulva.121-123 It has also been  \nreported that as many as 14% of patients  with a positive urine cytology \nand no visible disease in the bladder  had tumors in contiguous organs \nas the source of the positive cytology finding.124 If the bladder, prostate, \nand upper tract continue to show negative results on further evaluation, \nadditional follow -up is indicated after 3 months, then at longer intervals. \nIf BCG was given previously, maintenance BCG may be considered.   \nIf transurethral biopsy of the prostate is positive, treatment of the \nprostate should be initiated as described below (see Urothelial \nCarcinomas of the Prostate). If upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) \nis identified, then the treatment described below should be followed \n(see Upper  Tract Urothelial Carcinoma ). \nIf the selected mapping biopsy of the bladder is positive, then the AUA \nrisk group should be reclassified and the tumor managed according to NCCN Recommendations for Treatment of NMIBC , above.  \nIn a phase II multicenter study of NMIBC that recurred following two \ncourses of BCG, intravesical gemcitabine demonstrated activity that \nwas relegated to high- risk NMIBC .\n125 In the 47 patients with evaluable \nresponse, 47% had DFS at 3 months. The 1 -year RFS was 28% with all \ncases except for two attributed to the high- risk group. The 2- year RFS \nwas 21%. Intravesical gemcitabine had some activity in the high- risk \ngroup, and may  be an option if a candidate is not eligible for a \ncystectomy; however, the study results indicate that cystectomy is \npreferred when possible. Similarly, for patients with recurrence of \nhigh- grade cT1 disease after TURBT and induction BCG, cystectomy is \nthe recommended  option  with the best data for cure.126 Surveillance PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

Laboratory studies , such as \na complete blood count  (CBC)  and chemistry profile,  including alkaline \nphosphat ase, must  be performed . Since cisplatin -based chemotherapy \nis a preferred approach both for neoadjuvant therapy prior to \ncystectomy and as part of trimodal therapy for bladder preservation, an \nestimate d glomerular filtration rate (GFR ) should be obtained to assess \npatient eligibility for cispl atin. For patients with borderline GFR results, a \ntimed or measured urine collection may be considered to more \naccurately determine cisplatin eligibility.130  \nPatient s should also be assessed for regional or distant metastases. \nThis evaluation should include chest imaging (CT [preferred] , x-ray, or \nfluorodeoxyglucose [FDG ]-PET/CT [category 2B])  and evaluation for \nsuspected bone metastasis  in patients with symptoms or clinical \nsuspicion of bone metastasis (eg, elevated alkaline phosphat ase, focal \nbone pain) . Chest imaging with CT is preferred over chest x -ray based \non studies showing better sensitivity of CT for detection of metastatic \ndisease.131,132 Bone imaging may include a bone scan, MRI, or FDG -\nPET/CT (category 2B). Imaging studies help assess the extent of tumor \nspread to lymph nodes or distant organs.133,134 An abdominal/pelvic CT \nor MRI is used to assess the local and regional extent of disease.135,136 Unfortunately, CT scans, ultrasound, and  MRI cannot accurately predict \nthe true depth of invasion.   \nThe overwhelming majority of muscle invasive tumors are high- grade \nurothelial carcinomas. Further treatment following initial TURBT is often \nrequired for muscle invasive tumors, although select patients may be \ntreated with TURBT alone.137,138 Different treatment modalities are \ndiscussed below. These include radical cystectomy, partial cystectomy, \nneoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, bladder -preserving approaches, and \nsystemic therapy for advanced disease.  \nCystectomy  \nRadical Cystectomy  \nRadical surgical treatment of bladder cancer involves a cystoprostatectomy or a cystectomy and commonly a hysterectomy for \nthose with a uterus , followed by the formation of a urinary diversion , \nalthough in appropriately selected patients, approaches that preserve \nthe uterus, vagina, fallopian tubes, and/or ovaries may be used .\n139,140 \nThis surgery can be performed in an open or robotic manner.141-144 \nProstatectomy includes removal of the prostate, seminal vesicles, \nproximal vas deferens, and proximal urethra. Hysterectomy should \ninclude removal of the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, urethra, and part \nof the vagina. Forms of urinary diversion include an ileal conduit or \ndirecting urine to an internal urinary reservoir (such as a continent \npouch), with drainage to the abdominal wall or the urethra (orthotopic \nneobladder). Relative contraindications to urethral drainage include CIS  \nin the prostatic duct s or positive urethral margin. Orthotopic diversion or \na neobladder provides the closest bladder function to that  of a native \nbladder albeit with an increased risk for  nighttime incontinence as well \nas urinary retention requiring intermittent self -catheterization.

MS-17 NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nUnfortunately, the accuracy of the staging cystoscopy , EUA,  and \nTURBT  is modest, even when combined with cross -sectional imaging \nand when understaging is frequently encountered. A retrospective study \nof 778 patients with bladder cancer found that 42% of patients were \nupstaged following cystectomy.145 A pelvic lymph node dissection \n(PLND) is considered an integral part of the surgical management of bladder cancer. A more extensive PLND, which may include the \ncommon iliac or even lower para -aortic or para- caval nodes, yields \nmore nodes to be examined, i ncreases yield of positive nodes, and may \nbe associated with better survival and a lower pelvic recurrence rate.\n146-\n150 Conversely, a 2019 prospective, randomized trial concluded that an \nextended LND did not show a significant advantage over limited LND for \nRFS, cancer -specific survival, or OS.151 However, differing definitions of \n“extended” v ersus “limited” LND between studies and specifics on how \nthe study was powered complicate these results . Therefore, additional \ninformation will be needed to determine whether extended LND leads to \nimproved outcomes.  Results from the SWOG -1011 trial, which is fully \naccrued but not yet reported, may help to further answer  this \nquestion.152 Patient factors that may preclude a PLND include severe \nscarring secondary to previous treatments or surgery, advanced age, or severe comorbidities.  \nPartial  Cystectomy \nIn fewer than  5% of cases , an initial invasive tumor develops  in an area \nof the bladder where an adequate margin of soft tissue and an \nadequate amount  of noninvolved urothelium can be removed along with \nthe tumor without compromising continence or significantly reducing bladder capacity. Partial cystectomy is most frequently recommended \nfor lesions that develop on the dome of the bladder and have no \nassociated CIS in other areas of the urothelium. Relative \ncontraindications to this procedure are lesions that occur in the trigone \nor bladder neck. The requirement for a ureteral reimplantation, however, is not an absolute contraindication. Outcomes  data on partial \ncystectomy are varied and, in general, partial cystectomy is not \nconsidered the standard surgical treatment of muscle invasive bladder \ncancer. Ideal candidates are patients with cancer in a diverticulum or \nwith significant medical comorbidities.  \nSimilar to radical cystectomy, partial cystectomy begins with a \nlaparotomy (intraperitoneal) and resection of the pelvic lymph nodes. \nAlternatively, partial cystectomy may be safely done laparoscopically. If \nthe intraoperative findings preclude a partial c ystectomy, a radical \ncystectomy is performed. The decision to recommend adjuvant radiation \nor systemic therapy is based on the pathologic stage (ie, positive nodes \nor perivesical tissue involvement) or presence of a positive margin, \nsimilar to that for pat ients who undergo a radical cystectomy.  \nNeoadjuvant Chemotherapy  \nOne of the most noteworthy  issues in the treatment of bladder cancer is \nthe optimal use of perioperative chemotherapy for muscle invasive \ndisease. Data support the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before \ncystectomy for stage II and IIIA lesions .\n153-158 In a SWOG randomized \ntrial of 307 patients with muscle invasive disease,  radical cystectomy \nalone versus 3 (28-day) cycles of neoadjuvant methotrexate, \nvinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) followed by radical \ncystectomy were compared. N eoadjuvant chemotherapy increased \nmedian survival (77 vs. 46 months ; P = .06) and lowered the rate of \nresidual disease (15% vs. 38 %; P < .001) with no apparent increase in \ntreatment -related morbidity or mortality.153 In a meta- analysis of 11 trials \ninvolving 3005 patients, cisplatin -based multiagent neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy was associated with improved 5- year OS and DFS (5% \nand 9% absolute improvement, respectively).157 The randomized, phase \nIII JCOG0209 study comparing neoadjuvant MVAC to no neoadjuvant chemotherapy also found no difference in health -related quality of life PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

MS-18 NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nafter cystectomy, further supporting the use of neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy in all patients who are eligible to receive it.159 A review of \nthe National Cancer Database (NCDB) supports initiation of \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy as soon as possible, but not more than 8 \nweeks after diagnosis to prevent upstaging after radical cystectomy.160  \nSince the neoadjuvant trial with MVAC, the use of dose- dense MVAC \n(ddMVAC) with growth factor support in the metastatic setting has been \nshown to have good comparable tolerance with an increased complete \nresponse rate compared to standard (28 -day) dosing of MVAC (11% vs. \n25%; 2-sided P = .006).161 Based on these findings, ddMVAC has also \nbeen investigated in the neoadjuvant setting. In a multicenter \nprospective phase II trial, patients with cT2 to cT4a tumor staging and \nN0 or N1 muscle  invasive bladder cancer (n  = 44) were given 3 cycles \nof ddMVAC with pegfilgrastim followed by radical cystectomy and lymph \nnode dissection.162 ddMVAC was anticipated to have a safer profile, a \nshorter time to sur gery, and a similar pathologic complete response  rate \ncompared to historical control data for neoadjuvant MVAC \nchemotherapy  given in previous studies . Patients receiving ddMVAC \nhad no grade 3 or 4 renal toxicities and no toxicity -related deaths. \nGrade 1 or 2 treatment -related toxicities were seen in 82% of patients. \nThe median time to cystectomy was 9.7 weeks  from the start of \nchemotherapy .162 A separate single- arm phase II study also  reported \npathologic downstaging in 49% of patients receiving neoadjuvant \nddMVAC  with a similar safety profile .163 An additional neoadjuvant \nclinical trial of ddMVAC with bevacizumab reported 5- year survival \noutcomes of 63% and 64% (OS and DSS , respectively; median \nfollow- up, 49 months), with pT0N0 and less than or equal to pT1N0 \ndownstaging rates of 38% and 53%, respectively.164 Bevacizumab had \nno definitive impact on overall outcomes.  Gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) has also been evaluated for \nneoadjuvant therapy of muscle invasive bladder cancer, albeit mainly in \nsmaller  phase II or retrospective studies. Overall, these studies showed \nthat GC is effective and well -tolerated when used as neoadjuvant \ntherapy for muscle invasive bladder cancer ,165-169 although some of the \nstudies report lower pathologic response compared to MVAC168 and \nlack of a demonstrated OS benefit due to short follow -up or small study \nsize.166,167 More recently, the phase II COXEN trial has evaluated \nddMVAC and GC as neoadjuvant therapy for muscle invasive bladder \ncancer with the aim of validating scoring from a coexpression \nextrapolation algorithm -generated gene expression model.170,171 In the \nITT population of 227 patients, pT0 rates for ddMVAC and GC were 28% and 30% ( P = .75) and downstaging was 47% and 40% ( P = .27), \nrespectively.\n170 No significant difference between ddMVAC and GC was \nreported for OS or event -free survival.171 Dose -dense GC has been \nevaluated as neoadjuvant therapy in a prospective, phase II trial \nincluding 46 evaluable patients.172 The primary endpoint of this trial was \nmet as 57% of patients had their disease downstaged to NMIBC (less than pT2, N0). Pathologic response also correlated with improved RFS \nand OS. Thirty -nine percent of patients experienced dose modifications \ndue to tr eatment toxicity, but no patients were unable to undergo \ncystectomy due to treatment -related AEs. The most frequent treatment -\nrelated AE was anemia (12% grade 3).    \nThe randomized phase III GETUG/AFU V05 VESPER trial compared \nthe efficacy of ddMVAC to GC in the perioperative setting for 500 \npatients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.\n173,174 Of the 437 patients \nwho received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, organ- confined response \n(less than ypT3,  N0) was observed more frequently with ddMVAC than \nGC (77% vs. 63%; P = .001).173 PFS at 3 years was also significantly \nhigher among those who received neoadjuvant ddMVAC compared to \nneoadjuvant GC (66% vs. 56%; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51– 0.96; P = PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

An analysis comparing secondary endpoints of the VESPER trial \nalso reported a higher complete pathologic response rate for \nneoadjuvant ddMVAC compared to GC (42% vs. 36%).174 Reported \ntoxicity was similar between the therapies, with 52% of patients \nexperiencing grade 3 or higher AEs with ddMVAC compared to 55% \nwith GC. Grade 3 or higher AEs that were more frequently observed \nwith ddMVAC included gastrointestinal disorders ( P = .003) and \nasthenia ( P = .001). A systematic review and meta- analysis similarly \nshowed a significantly higher rate of pathologic complete response and \nOS for neoadjuvant therapy with ddMVAC compared to GC.175 \nIn an international, multicenter, randomized trial (BA06 30894) that \ninvestigated the effectiveness of neoadjuvant cisplatin, methotrexate, \nand vinblastine (CMV) in 976 patients, neoadjuvant CMV resulted in a \n16% reduction in mortality risk (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72– 0.99; P = .037)  \nat a median follow -up of 8 years.158 However, based on NCCN Panel \nconsensus that this regimen is not used in their practices, CMV is no \nlonger recommended as an option for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends  neoadjuvant chemotherapy  followed by \nradical cystectomy  for patients with stage II or IIIA bladder cancer . \nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy  followed by radical cystectomy  is a \ncategory 1 recommendation based on high- level data supporting its \nuse. For highly select patients with stage II disease who receive a \npartial cystectomy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a category 2A \nrecommendation. Patients with hearing loss or neuropathy, poor \nperformance status, or renal insufficiency may not be eligible for cisplatin -based chemotherapy. If cisplatin -based chemotherapy cannot \nbe given, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not recommended. Carboplatin has not demonstrated a survival benefit and  should not be substituted \nfor cisplatin in the perioperative setting.  Cystectomy alone is an \nappropriate option for these patients. Based on results of the VESPER trial, ddMVAC is the preferred regimen for perioperative treatment of \nmuscle  invasive bladder cancer. For patients with borderline renal \nfunction or minimal dysfunction, a split -dose administration of cisplatin \nmay be considered (category 2B) . Although split -dose is a safer \nalternative, the relative efficacy remains undefined.   \nAdjuvant  Systemic Therapy  \nData are less clear  regarding the role of adjuvant systemic therapy in \ninvasive bladder cancer. Studies have shown that adjuvant \nchemotherapy may delay recurrences and improve OS\n176-178; however,  \nno randomized comparisons of adequate sample size have definitively \nshown a survival benefit , in large part due to poor accrual .179 Clinical \ntrials of adjuvant chemotherapy with c yclophosphamide, doxorubicin, \nand cisplatin (CAP) ; MVAC ; and methotrexate, vinblastine, epirubicin, \nand cisplatin (MVEC)  regimens have each suggested a survival \nadvantage.180-182 However, methodologic issues question the \napplicability of these studies to all patients with urothelial tumors. In the \nMVEC trial, patients who experienced relapse in the control arm did not \nreceive chemotherapy, which is not typical of more contemporary \ntreatment approaches . Many of these trials were not randomized, \nraising the question of selection bi as in the analysis of outcomes.  \nA meta -analysis of 6 trials found a 25% mortality reduction with adjuvant \nchemotherapy, but the authors pointed out several limitations of the data and concluded that evidence is insufficient for treatment \ndecisions.\n183 Interestingly, the follow -up analysis included 3 more \nstudies for a total of 9 trials (N  = 945 patients).178 A 23% risk reduction \nfor death was observed in the updated analysis (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, \n0.59– 0.99; P = .049) and improved DFS  was achieved (HR, 0.66; 95% \nCI, 0.45 –0.91; P = .014). Patients with node -positive disease had an \neven greater DFS benefit.178 An observational study evaluated 5653 \npatients of which 23% received adjuvant chemotherapy PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

Based on these results, ddMVAC is \npreferred over GC for adjuvant chemotherapy.  \nCheckpoint inhibitors have also been investigated in the adjuvant \nsetting, with the phase 3 CheckMate 274 trial of adjuvant nivolumab \nreporting positive results for its primary endpoints  across the entire \nstudy population, although the authors note the possibility of a larger effect size for bladder compared to UTUC (see Adjuvant Treatment  and \nFollow -up under UTUC, below , for more discussion on these data) .\n185 In \nthe ITT population  of 709 patients with muscle  invasive urothelial \ncarcinoma treated with radical surgery  on CheckMate 274, DFS was \n20.8 months with nivolumab compared to 10.8 months with placebo \n(HR, 0.70; 98.22% CI, 0.55– 0.90; P < .001). For patients with a \nprogrammed death -ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression level of 1% or more, \nDFS was 74.5% with nivolumab and 55.7% with placebo (HR, 0.55; \n98.72% CI, 0.35– 0.85; P < .001). Importantly, adjuvant nivolumab was \ntested both in patients who had received neoadjuvant therapy as well as those who did not; 43.4% of the trial participants had received previous cisplatin- based neoadjuvant therapy. Treatment -related AEs of \ngrade 3 or higher occurred in 17.9% of those treated with nivolumab and 7.2% of those treated with placebo.  Further follow -up is ongoing to \nassess OS outcomes.  While atezolizumab has also been tested in the \nadjuvant setting for patients with high- risk muscle  invasive urothelial \ncarcinoma in the phase 3 IMvigor010 study, this study did not  meet its \nprimary endpoint of improved DFS with adjuvant atezolizumab \ncompared to observation.\n186 Median DFS was 19.4 months with \natezolizumab compared to 16.6 months with observation (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.74– 1.08; P = .24).  \nThe NCCN Guidelines suggest that adjuvant systemic therapy should \nbe discussed with  patients with high- risk pathology after cystectomy. If \ncisplatin -based neoadjuvant therapy was not given and the tumor is \nfound to be pT3, pT4, or pN+ following resection, adjuvant cisplatin-\nbased chemotherapy is the preferred approach, although adjuvant \nnivolumab may also be considered. If cisplatin- based neoadjuvant \ntherapy was given and the tumor is ypT2– ypT4a or ypN+, nivolumab \nmay be considered, although consideration of this  approach should \nbalance its effect at delaying progression of disease with the risk of side \neffects . A minimum of 3 cycles of a cisplatin -based combination, such \nas ddMVAC  (preferred)  or GC, may be used in patients undergoing \nperioperative chemotherapy. Chemotherapy r egimen and dosing \nrecommendations are mainly based on studies in advanced \ndisease.\n153,165,187,188 Carboplatin has not demonstrated a survival benefit \nand should not be substituted for cisplatin in the perioperative setting.  It \nshould be noted that patients with tumors that are pT2 or less  and have \nno nodal involvement or lymphovascular invasion after cystectomy  are \nconsidered to have lower risk and are not recommended to receive \nadjuvant therapy.

MS-21 NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nAdjuvant Radiation  \nPatients with locally advanced disease ( pT3– 4) have high rates of pelvic \nrecurrence and poor OS after radical cystectomy, PLND, and \nperioperative chemotherapy (pelvic failure 20% –45% and survival 10 %–\n50% at 5 years, depending on risk factors).189-192 There is an interest in \nusing adjuvant radiation to improve these outcomes , but data are limited \nand further prospective studies are needed to confirm its benefits.  One \nolder randomized study of 236 patients with pT3a to pT4a bladder \ncancer demonstrated improvement in 5- year DFS and local control \ncompared to surgery alone.193 A more recent randomized phase II trial \ncompar ed adjuvant sequential chemotherapy and radiation v ersus \nadjuvant chemotherapy alone in 120 patients with locally advanced \ndisease with one or more risk factors  (≥pT3b, grade 3,  or node-\npositive) , in a study population with a high proportion of squamous cell \ncarcinoma. This study  demonstrated a significant improvement in local \ncontrol for chemoradiation (3 -year local control of 96% vs. 69% ; P < \n.01) and marginal improvements in DFS and OS. Late- grade ≥3 \ngastroi ntestinal toxicity on the chemoradiation arm was low  (7% of \npatients) .194 A 2019 systematic review evaluating the oncologic efficacy \nof adjuvant radiation for bladder cancer or UTUC concluded that there \nwas no clear benefit of adjuvant radiation following radical surgery (eg, \ncystectomy), although the combination of adjuvant radiation with \nchemotherapy may be beneficial in locally advanced disease.195  \nWhile there are no conclusive data demonstrating improvements in OS, \nit is reasonable to consider adjuvant radiation in patients with pT3/pT4 \nurothelial bladder cancer with positive nodes or margins at the time of \nsurgery , although this approach has been evaluated in only a limited \nnumber of studies, reflected by the  category 2B  designation. Patients \nmeeting these characteristics with positive surgical margins and/or \nlymph nodes identified in the pelvic dissection have especially high \npelvic recurrence  rates (40% –45% by 5 years), and adjuvant radiation is reasonably well tolerated and improves local control . Radiation with a \ndose range of 45 to 50.4 Gy without concurrent chemotherapy may be \nused. In patients who have not had prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy, it \nmay be reasonable to sandwich adjuvant radiation between cycles of \nadjuvant chemotherapy.194 The safety and efficacy of concurrent \nsensitizing chemotherapy and radiation in the adjuvant setting needs to be further studied.  \nBladder Preservation   \nAll bladder -sparing approaches are based on the principle that not all \ncases require an immediate cystectomy , and the decision to remove the \nbladder can be deferred until the response to organ- sparing therapy is \nassessed.  In fact, a meta- analysis of 73 studies comprising 9110 \npatients reported  that only 19.2% of patients who initially receive \nbladder -preserving therapy for muscle  invasive bladder cancer \neventually require radical cystectomy due to recurrence or lack of \nresponse.\n196 Another multicenter retrospective analysis of 287 patients \nwith cN+ M0 bladder cancer showed no difference in OS (HR, 0.94; \n95% CI, 0.63– 1.41; P = .76) or PFS (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.50– 1.08; P = \n.12) between radical cystectomy versus organ preservation  with radical \ndose radiotherapy.197 Receiving radical cystectomy or bladder -sparing \ntrimodality therapy was , however,  associated with improved OS \ncompared to  palliative treatment  (P < .001) .  \nBladder -preserving approaches are reasonable alternatives to \ncystectomy for patients who are medically unfit for surgery and those  \nseek ing an alternative  to radical cystectomy .198,199 Combined modality \nchemoradiation therapy as an alternative to immediate cystectomy for muscle  invasive bladder cancer is  endorsed by multiple international \norganizations that have developed evidence- based consensus \nguidelines and recommendations , including the International \nConsultation on Urologic Diseases -European Association of Urology  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

Reports have suggested that up to 45% of bladders may be clinically understaged after TURBT.\n204,206,207 \nConversely, one series reported that all patients who achieved a \ncomplete response after radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin and \nfluorouracil ( 5-FU) were pT0 on immediate cystectomy.208 Although \nstudies report differing frequencies of residual disease after cytotoxic agents (either radiation or chemotherapy), there is consensus that the \nrate is lower for patients who present with T2 disease than with T3 \ndisease, which should be considered when proposing a bladder -sparing \napproach.   \nThe decision to use a bladder -preserving approach is partially based on \nthe location of the lesion, depth of invasion, size of the tumor, status of \nthe “uninvolved” urothelium, and status of the patient (eg, bladder \ncapacity, bladder function, comorbidities). Bladder preservation as an \nalternative to cystectomy is generally reserved for patients with smaller solitary tumors, negative nodes, no extensive or multifocal CIS, no \ntumor -related moderate or severe hydronephrosis, and good \npre-treatment bladder function. Patients who are medically fit for radical \ncystectomy but who have hydronephrosis are poor candidates for bladder -sparing procedures.\n209,210 Maximal TURBT with concurrent \nchemoradiotherapy should be given as primary treatment for these patients, with radiotherapy alone or TURBT alone reserved for select \npatients ( see TURBT Alone as Primary Treatment for Muscle Invasive \nBladder Cancer  below for more information). When possible, \nbladder -sparing options should be chosen in the context of clinical trials.   \nRadiotherapy with Concurrent Chemotherapy Following TURBT as \nPrimary Treatment for Muscle  Invasive Bladder Cancer  \nSeveral groups have investigated the combination of concurrent or \nsequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy after TURBT. First, an \nendoscopic resection that is as complete as possible is performed. \nIncomplete resection is an unfavorable prognostic factor fo r the ability to \npreserve the bladder.211-213 \nRadiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)  protocol 89- 03 compared \nconcurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy with or without 2  cycles of \ninduction MCV (methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine) \nchemotherapy.210 No difference in complete clinical response or  5-year \nOS was observed between the treatment arms.  Other studies also \nreported no significant survival benefit for neoadjuvant chemotherapy \nbefore bladder -preserving chemotherapy with radiation therapy \n(RT).212,214 \nIn the phase 3 RTOG 89- 03 trial in which 123 patients with clinical stage \nT2–T4a were treated with radiotherapy plus concurrent cisplatin, with or \nwithout induction MCV chemotherapy, 5- year OS was approximately \n49% in both arms.210 The subsequent RTOG 95- 06 trial treated 34 \npatients with twice -daily irradiation and concurrent cisplatin and 5 -FU PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

MS-23 NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nand reported a 3 -year OS of 83%.215 The RTOG 97- 06 trial treated 47 \npatients with twice -daily irradiation and concurrent cisplatin; patients \nalso received adjuvant chemotherapy with CMV.216 Three- year OS was \n61%. In the RTOG 99 -06 study, 80 patients received twice- daily \nirradiation plus cisplatin and paclitaxel, followed by adjuvant cisplatin \nand gemcitabine. Five -year OS was 56%.217 In RTOG 0233, 97 patients \nreceived twice- daily radiation with concurrent paclitaxel plus cisplatin or \n5-FU plus cisplatin. Five -year OS was 73%.218 RTOG 0712 investigated \n5-FU plus cisplatin with twice -daily radiation or gemcitabine with once-\ndaily radiation, with 33 patients eligible for analysis on each arm . Three -\nyear distant metastasis -free survival rates were 78% and 84%, \nrespectively.219 Taken together, the complete response rates ranged \nfrom 59% to 88%. \nUp to approximately  80% of long- term survivors maintain an intact \nbladder, while other patients ultimately require radical cystectomy.209-217 \nA combined analysis of survivors from four of these trials, with a median \nfollow- up of 5.4 years, showed that combined- modality therapy was \nassociated with low rates of late grade 3 toxicit ies (5.7% genitourinary \nand 1.9% gastrointestinal).220 No late grade 4 toxicities or \ntreatment -related deaths were recorded.  \nBased on the trials described above, as well as the phase 3 BC2001 \ntrial that demonstrated a  locoregional DFS benefit for those treated with \n5-FU and mitomyc in concurrently with radiotherapy compared to \nradiotherapy alone, with no significant increase in AEs,221 bladder \npreservation with concurrent chemoradiotherapy was given a category 1 \ndesignation for primary treatment of stage II or IIIA bladder cancer.  \nA meta -analysis of individual patient data from two randomized, phase \nIII studies (BC2001 and BCON) compared two radiotherapy \nfractionation schedules that are commonly used in treatment of locally \nadvanced bladder cancer, a standard schedule of 64 Gy in 32 fractions over 6.5 weeks and a hypo fractionated schedule of 55 Gy in 20 \nfractions over 4 weeks.222 This analysis found that the hypofractionated \nschedule is noninferior  to the standard fractionation schedule for both \ninvasive local control and toxicity and that the hypofractionated \nschedule is superior regarding invasive local control.      \nChemotherapy Following TURBT as Primary Treatment for Muscle  \nInvasive Bladder Cancer  \nChemotherapy alone is considered to be inadequate without additional \ntreatment to the bladder and it remains investigational . Studies showed \nthat the proportions of complete pathologic response in the bladder using neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone were only up to 38%.\n153 A \nhigher proportion of bladders can be rendered tumor -free and therefore \npreserved when chemotherapy is combined with concurrent \nradiotherapy.   \nRadiotherapy Following TURBT as Primary Treatment for Muscle  \nInvasive Bladder Cancer  \nRadiotherapy alone is inferior to radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy for patients with an invasive bladder tumor, and is not \nconsidered standard for patients who can tolerate combined \ntherapy.\n221,223 In a randomized trial of 360 patients, radiotherapy with \nconcurrent mitomycin C and 5- FU improved 2- year locoregional DFS \nfrom 54% (radiotherapy alone) to 67% ( P = .01), and 5- year OS from \n35% to 48% ( P = .16), without increasing grade 3 –4 acute or late \ntoxicit ies.221 Hence, radiotherapy alone is only indicated for those who \ncannot tolerate a cystectomy or chemotherapy because of medical comorbidities.  \nTURBT Alone as Primary Treatment for Muscle  Invasive Bladder Cancer  \nTURBT alone may be an option for patients with stage II  disease who \nare not candidates for cystectomy.

These cases should also have n o \nassociated in situ component, palpable mass, or associated \nhydronephrosis.224  \nIf primary treatment consists of  TURBT alone, patients should undergo \nan aggressive re -resection of the site within 4 weeks of the primary \nprocedure to ensure that no residual disease is present . If the repeat \nTURBT is negative for residual tumor, treatment  can be managed \nconservatively with repeat endoscopic evaluations and cytologies every \n3 months until a relapse is documented. T he stage of the lesion \ndocumented at relapse would determine further management decisions .  \nNCCN Recommendations for Treatment of Muscle  Invasive \nBladder Cancer  \nTreatment of Stage II and IIIA Tumors   \nThe critical issues in the care and prognosis of these patients  are \nwhether a palpable mass is appreciated at EUA  and if the tumor has \nextended through the bladder wall. Tumors that are organ -confined (T2 , \nstage II ) have a better prognosis than those that have extended through \nthe bladder wall in to the perivesical fat (T3) and beyond. T4a tumors \ninvolve the prostatic stroma, uterus, or vagina and are typically \nsurgically managed similar to T3 tumors.  \nPrimary surgical treatment for stage II and IIIA disease is a radical \ncystectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy \nis recommended (category 1). Partial cystectomy along with \nneoadjuvant cisplatin- based chemotherapy  can be considered for  stage \nII (cT2, N0) disease  with a single tumor in a suitable location and no \npresence of CIS . Partial cystectomy is not an option for patients with \nstage III  disease . If cisplatin -based neoadjuvant therapy was not given \nand the tumor is found to be pT3, pT4, or pN+ following resection, \nadjuvant cisplatin- based chemotherapy is the preferred approach, \nalthough adjuvant nivolumab may also be considered. If cisplatin- based neoadjuvant therapy was given and the tumor is ypT2– ypT4a or ypN+, \nnivolumab may be considered.  Adjuvant RT is another option for \npatients  with tumors that are pT3–4, with positive nodes or margins , at \nthe time of surgery  (category 2B) . \nBladder preservation with maximal TURBT followed by concurrent \nchemoradiotherapy is another category 1 primary treatment option for \nthese patients . Candidates for this bladder -sparing approach include \npatients with tumors that present  without moderate or severe \nhydronephrosis and tumors that allow a visibly complete or a maximally \ndebulking TURBT. Radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin- based \nchemotherapy or 5- FU plus mitomycin as a radiosensitizer is the most \ncommon and well -studied chemoradiation method us ed to treat muscle  \ninvasive bladder cancer.208-212,221,223,225 Therefore, based on clinical \npractice and strength of the data, t he following radiosensitizing \nregimens are preferred for organ- preserving chemoradiation : 5-FU plus \nmitomycin C, cisplatin alone, or low -dose gemcitabine. Cisplatin plus 5 -\nFU or cisplatin plus paclitaxel  may be considered as  alternative \nregimens.  Other radiosensitizing chemotherapy regimens that may be \nused with palliative intent, but would rarely be appropriate for curative -\nintent chemoradiotherapy for organ preservation,  are docetaxel \n(category 2B), paclitaxel (category 2B), 5- FU (category 2B), or \ncapecitabine (category 3) monotherapies.   \nThe overall tumor status should be reassessed 2 to 3 months after \ntreatment  completion. If no residual tumor is detected, surveillance is \nappropriate.  If residual disease is present, surgical consolidation of \nbladder -only residual disease or treatment as metastatic disease may \nbe appropriate. If residual disease is CIS , Ta, or T1, TURBT with or \nwithout intravesical therapy  may be considered.  \nIn patients with extensive comorbid disease or poor performance status \nwho are not candidates for cystectomy or definitive chemoradiotherapy , PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

MS-25 NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \ntreatment options include radiotherapy alone or TURBT.  The overall \ntumor status should be reassessed 2 to 3 months after treatment  \ncompletion. If no tumor is evident, the patient should be observed. If \ntumor is observed, systemic therapy , radiotherapy  (if no prior \nradiotherapy ), TURBT  with or without intravesical therapy , or best \nsupportive care may be given.  \nTreatment of Stage IIIB Tumors  \nPrimary treatment for stage IIIB (cT1 –T4a, N2– 3) disease can include \neither  downstaging systemic therapy or concurrent \nchemoradiotherapy .226,227 A population- based study of 659 patients \nwith cT1 –T4a, node- positive urothelial bladder cancer tested the \neffectiveness of induction chemotherapy for pathologic \ndownstaging.227 For cN1 disease, complete pathologic downstaging \nwas achieved in 39% of patients who received induction \nchemotherapy compared to 5% of patients who did not receive \ninduction chemotherapy. For cN2– 3, the rate of pathologic \ndownstaging was 27% v ersus 3% for these two groups. OS was also \nimproved in patients who received induction chemotherapy ( P < .001) , \nalthough the nature of the study limits interpretation of the OS results.227 \nAnother study used the NCDB  to analyze outcomes of 1783 patients \nwith clinically node -positive bladder cancer who were treated with \nchemotherapy alone (n = 1388) or chemoradiotherapy (n = 395).226 \nThis study found that patients treated with chemoradiotherapy had a higher median OS than those treated with chemotherapy (19.0 vs. \n13.8 months ; P < .001). The improvement in outcome with \nchemoradiotherapy persisted upon evaluation of propensity -matched \npopulations ( P < .001).\n226 Cystectomy as primary treatment or for \nsurgical palliation may be appropriate in very select situations, such as  \nin patients with limiting local symptoms and/or those with comorbidities \nthat prevent administration of chemotherapy.  Tumor status should be reassessed 2 to 3 months after treatment by \nimaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis using CT with contrast. If \nthere is no evidence of distant disease on imaging reassessment, further cystoscopic assessment of tumor response in the bladder may \nbe considered . \nSubsequent disease management depends on the response to \nprimary treatment.  Patients who received downstaging systemic \ntherapy and had a complete disease response may then be \nsubsequently treated with cystectomy or chemoradiotherapy or may \nbe observed until disease relapse, depending on patient -specific \nfeatures. Patients who received downstaging systemic therapy and showed a partial response may be treated with cystectomy or \nchemoradiotherapy (for persistent disease confined to the bladder) or \ntreated as  with metastatic disease with additional lines of systemic \ntherapy (for distant disease). Patients who had disease progression following primary downstaging systemic therapy may be treated as \nwith metastatic disease, with additional lines of systemic therapy.  \nPatients with complete disease response following concurrent \nchemoradiotherapy should be observed until disease relapse. Disease \nwith p artial responses to concurrent chemoradiotherapy may be \nsubsequently treated with surgical consolidation (for residual disease \nconfined to the bladder), with consideration of intravesical BCG (for \nCIS, Ta, or T1 residual disease), or as metastatic disease with \nsystemic therapy (for remaining disease outside the bladder). \nProgression following concurrent chemoradiotherapy may  be treated \nas metastatic disease with systemic therapy.  \nTreatment of Stage IVA Tumors  \nStage IVA includes patients with cT4b, any N, M0 or any T, any N, M1a disease.\n20 For patients with stage IVA disease, treatment options \ndiffer depending on the presence of distant metastasis (M0 vs .

MS-26 NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nPrimary treatment recommendation s for patients with M0 disease  \ninclude systemic therapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy  followed by \nevaluation with cystoscopy,  EUA, TURBT,  and imaging  of the \nabdomen and pelvis. If no evidence of tumor is present after primary \ntreatment , the patient may be treated with  consolidation systemic \ntherapy  or adjuvant treatment with chemoradiotherapy may be initiated \nif the patient did not receive prior radiotherapy. In general, stage IVA \ndisease is considered unresectable. However , in patients with disease \nthat responds to treatment, cystectomy may be an option if the tumor \nbecomes technically resectable.  If residual disease is noted  on \nevaluation after primary therapy , systemic therapy or cystectomy is \nrecommended. Systemic therapy may include targeted therapy , \nchemoradiotherapy (if no prior radiotherapy), or chemotherapy. Cystec tomy, if feasible, is an option.  \nPatients with M1a disease  should receive systemic therapy  as primary \ntreatment . Those select patients with metastatic disease treated with \ncurative intent  should be evaluated with cystoscopy, EUA, TURBT, \nand abdominal /pelvi c imaging. If a complete or partial response is \nnoted following primary treatment of metastatic disease,  consolidative \nlocal therapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy  or cystectomy  may \nbe considered in select cases . If the disease remains stable or \nprogresses  following primary therapy, th ese patients should follow \ntreatment for metastatic disease .  \nFollow -up \nResults from a meta- analysis of 13,185 patients who have undergone \ncystectomy reported a 0.75% to 6.4% prevalence of upper tract \nrecurrence.\n228 Surveillance by urine cytology or upper tract imaging \ndetected recurrences in 7% and 30% of cases, respectively.  Follow -up after a cystectomy should include urine cytology, liver \nfunction tests, creatinine,  and electrolytes.  Imaging of the c hest, upper \ntract abdomen,  and pelvis should be conducted at intervals based on \nthe risk of recurrence. Patients should be monitored annually for vitamin \nB12 deficiency if a continent urinary diversion was created. Consider \nurethral wash cytology  for patients with an ileal conduit or continent \ncatheterizable diversion,  particularly if CIS was found within the bladder  \nor prostatic urethra. For details of follow -up recommendations, see \nFollow -up in the algorithm.  \nFollow -up after a partial cystectomy is similar to that for a radical \ncystectomy, with the addition of monitoring for relapse in the bladder by  \nserial cytologic examinations and cystoscopies  (may include selected \nmapping biopsy) . \nFor patients who have a preserved bladder, there is a risk for \nrecurrence in the bladder or elsewhere in the urothelial tract and \ndistantly. Imaging studies  and laboratory testing  should be performed as \noutlined under post -cystectomy follow -up. Additionally, c ontinued \nmonitoring of the urothelium with cystoscopy and urinary cytologies  with \nor without mapping biopsy is a routine part of the management of all cases in which the bladder is preserved.  \nRecurrent or Persistent Disease \nA positive cytology with no evidence of disease in the bladder  following \nimaging and cystoscopy should be managed as described in the \nPosttreatment of Recurrent or Persistent Disease under Non-Muscle \nInvasive Urothelial Bladder Cancer , above.   \nFor patients with a preserved bladder,  local recurrence or persistent \ndisease should be evaluated as a new cancer. Recurrences  are treated \nbased on the extent of disease at relapse, with consideration of prior \ntreatment.

Invasive disease is \ngenerally managed with radical cystectomy, and a second attempt at \nbladder preservation is not advisable. Cystectomy  may not be possible \nin a patient who has undergone a full course of EBRT  and has bulky \nresidual disease. For these patients,  systemic therapy or palliative \nTURBT  and best supportive care  is advised.  \nSubsequent -line therapy for metastatic disease or local recurrence  \nfollowing cystectomy  generally would include systemic therapy . \nRadiotherapy alone can also be considered as a subsequent -line \ntherapy  for patients with metastatic disease or local recurrence following \ncystectomy, especially in selected cases with regional -only recurrence \nor with clinical symptoms.  \nMetastatic (Stage IVB) Urothelial Bladder Cancer \nApproximately 5% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of \ndiagnosis.2 Additionally, approximately half of all patients relapse after \ncystectomy depending on the pathologic stage of the tumor and nodal \nstatus. Local recurrences account for approximately 10% to 30% of \nrelapses, whereas distant metastases are more common.  \nEvaluation  of Metastatic Disease  \nIf metastasis is suspected, additional workup to evaluate the extent of \nthe disease is necessary. This includes a chest CT and a bone scan if \nenzyme levels are abnormal or the patient shows signs or symptoms of skeletal involvement. Central nervous system (CNS) imaging should be \nconsidered. An estimate d GFR should be obtained to assess patient \neligibility for cisplatin. For patients with borderline GFR results, a timed or measured urine collection may  be considered to more accurately \ndetermine cisplatin eli gibility.\n130 If the evidence of spread is limited to \nnodes  and biopsy is technically feasible, nodal biopsy should be considered and patients ’ disease should be managed as previously \noutlined for positive nodal disease (stage IIIA, stage IIIB, or stage IVA). \nMolecular testing should also be performed for patients with metastatic \ndisease (see Molecular/Genomic Testing , below).  \nPatients who present with disseminated metastatic disease are \ngenerally treated with systemic therapy . Metastasectomy and/or \npalliative radiotherapy may also be useful for select patients.229  \nMetastasectomy for Oligometastatic Disease  \nHighly select patients with oligometastatic disease who are without \nevidence of rapid progression may benefit from metastasectomy \nfollowing response to systemic therapy. While there are limited \nprospective data supporting the role of metastasectomy for treatment of \nurothelial bladder cancer, several retrospective studies have \ndemonstrated that metastasectomy can be a valid treatment option for \ncertain patients with metastatic bladder cancer, particularly those with \nfavorable response to systemic therapy, solitary metastatic lesions, and \nlung or lymph node sites of disease.  \nA phase II trial of 11 patients with bladder primary urothelial carcinoma \nmetastatic to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes who underwent complete \nbilateral retroperitoneal lymph node dissection reported 4- year DSS and \nRFS rates of 36% and 27%. Patients with viable tumor in no more than \ntwo lymph nodes and/or excellent response to presurgical systemic \nchemotherapy showed the best survival rates indicating that a low \nburden of disease or good response to presurgical chemotherapy may \nbe important in achieving benefit from metastastectomy.230 Another \nphase II trial of 70 patients who underwent complete surgical resection \nof bladder cancer metastases investigated survival, performance status, \nand quality of life following surgery.

The best outcomes were \nassociated with radiologic nodal complete response to preoperative \nchemotherapy and pN0 versus pN+, but were similar for cN1 –3 versus \ncM1.\n236 A systematic review and meta -analysis of available studies, \nincluding a total of 412 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, \nreported an improved OS for patients who underwent metastasectomy \ncompared to non- surgical treatment of metastatic lesions. Five -year \nsurvival in these studies ranged from 28% to 72%.237 Another \npopulation- based analysis of 497 patients ≥ 65 years who had at least \none metastasectomy for treatment of urothelial carcinoma found that \nwith careful patient selection, metastasectomy is safe and can be \nassociated with long- term survival in this patient population.238 \nConversely, a study that queried the NCDB database from 2004 to 2016 reported no difference in OS between propensity score- matched \npatients with urothelial carcinoma who had undergone metastasectomy \ncompared with those who had not (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83– 1.07; P = \n.38).\n239 This study found that 7% of metastatic urothelial carcinoma \npatients were treated with metastasectomy and, on average, patients \ntreated with metastasectomy were younger, had greater than cT3 \ndisease, had radical surgery on the primary tumor, and received \nsystemic therapy.  \nDue to the limited and somewhat conflicting evidence supporting metastasectomy for bladder cancer, and the often extensive and difficult nature of the surgery, it is important to carefully select appropriate \npatients for metastasectomy, including consideration of patient \nperformance status,  comorbidities , and overall clinical picture.   \nMolecular/ Genomic Testing  \nThe panel recommends that molecular/genomic testing be performed \nfor stages IVA and IVB bladder cancer  and may be considered for stage \nIIIB. This testing should  be performed only in laboratories that are \ncertified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA -88) as qualified to perform highly complex molecular \npathology testing.\n240 The NCCN Bladder Cancer Panel recommends \nthat molecular/genomic testing be conducted  early, ideally at diagnosis \nof advanced bladder cancer, to facilitate treatment decision- making and \nto prevent delays in administering later lines of therapy. In addition to \ndetermining eligibility for FDA -approved therapies, molecular/genomic \ntesting may  be used to screen for clinical trial eligibility.  \nBased on the FDA approval s for erdafitinib  and fam -trastuzumab \nderuxtecan , molecular  testing should include analysis for FGFR3  \ngenetic alterations  and HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry \n(IHC) . For certain patients who are ineligible to receive cisplatin, the \ncheckpoint inhibitor atezolizumab may be considered for first- line \ntherapy based on PD -L1 testing results (see Checkpoint Inhibitor \nMonotherapy as  First-line Treatment , below).  \nGenetic alterations are known to be common in bladder  cancer, with \ndata from the Cancer Genome Atlas rank ing bladder cancer as the third \nhighest mutated cancer .241,242 Supporting this, a study that looked at \ncomprehensive genomic profiling of 295 cases of advanced urothelial carcinoma found that 93% of cases had at least one clinically relevant \ngenetic alteration, with a mean of 2.6 clinically relevant genetic alterations per case.

An assessment of clinical application is currently \nunderway to better determine how “platinum -ineligible” may be \ndefined.244 Newer combinations  with better clinical utility , such as the \nimmune checkpoint inhibitors , antibody -drug conjugates,  and targeted \ntherapies, provide other treatment options  for these patients who are \nnot candidates for cisplatin- based chemotherapy.  \nFor patients with metastatic disease treated with chemotherapy, \ndisease status should be  re-evaluated after two  to three  cycles of \nchemotherapy, and treatment is continued for two  more cycles in \npatients whose disease responds or remains stable. C hemotherapy  \nmay be continued for a maximum of six cycles  in most cases , \ndepending on response and tolerance . If no response is noted after two \ncycles or if significant morbidities are encountered, a change in therapy is advised, considering the patient’s current performance status, extent \nof disease, and specific prior therapy.  \nSurgery or radiotherapy may be feasible  in highly select metastatic \ncases for patients who show a major partial response in a previously  \nunresectable primary tumor or who have a solitary site of residual \ndisease that is resectable after chemotherapy. If disease is completely \nresected, two additional cycles of chemotherapy can be considered, \ndepending on patient tolerance.  \nPlatinum -Based Chemotherapy Regimens (ddMVAC  or GC)  \nGC245,246 and ddMVAC161,187 are commonly used combination \nchemotherapy regimens  that have shown clinical benefit. A large, \ninternational, phase III study randomized 405 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease to GC or standard (28 -day) MVAC.\n188 \nAt a median follow -up of 19 months, OS and time to progression were \nsimilar in the two arms. Fewer toxic deaths were recorded among \npatients receiving GC compared to MVAC (1% vs. 3%), although this \ndid not reach statistical significance. A 5 -year update analysis confirmed \nthat GC was not superior  to MVAC in terms of survival  (OS, 13.0% vs. \n15.3%; PFS, 9.8% vs. 11.3%, respectively) .246 Another large, \nrandomized, phase III trial compared ddMVAC to standard (28- day) \nMVAC.161,187 At a median follow -up of 7.3 years, 24.6% of patients were \nalive in the ddMVAC cohort compared with 13.2% in the standard \nMVAC cohort. There was one toxic death in each arm, but less overall \ntoxicity was seen in the dose- dense group.  From these data, ddMVAC \nhad improved toxicity and efficacy as compared to standard MVAC; \ntherefore, standard (28 -day) MVAC is no longer used. Both GC and \nddMVAC with growth factor support are c ategory 1 recommendations  \nfor metastatic disease.  \nThe performance status of the patient is a major determinant in the \nselection of a regimen  and can often limit the use of cisplatin- containing PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

Regimens with lower toxicity profiles \nare recommended in patients with compromised liver or renal status or \nserious comorbid conditions. In patients who are not cisplatin- eligible , \ncarboplatin may  be substituted for cisplatin in the metastatic setting for \ncisplatin -ineligible patients such as those with a GFR less than 60 \nmL/min . A phase II/III study assessed two carboplatin- containing \nregimens in medically unfit patients (performance status 2).247 The \noverall response rate (ORR)  was 42% for gemcitabine plus carboplatin \nand 30% for methotrexate, carboplatin, and vinblastine. However, the \nresponse rates dropped to 26% and 20%, respectively, with increased \ntoxicity among patients who were both unfit and had renal impairment \n(GFR <60  mL/min).  \nAvelumab maintenance therapy is recommended following cisplatin-  or \ncarboplatin- based first -line therapy if there is no progression on first -line \nplatinum -containing chemotherapy (see Avelumab Maintenance \nTherapy , below).  \nPembrolizumab Plus Enfortumab Vedotin -ejfv \nA combination of the immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, with \nthe antibody -drug conjugate, enfortumab vedotin, was initially studied in \ncertain cohorts of the phase Ib/II EV103 study, which included cisplatin-\nineligible patients with previously unt reated, locally advanced or \nmetastatic urothelial cancer.248,249 Forty -five patients within cohort A \nreceived the combination of enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab.248 \nAfter a median of nine treatment cycles, the confirmed ORR was 73.3%, with a complete response rate of 15.6%. The most common treatment -\nrelated AEs were peripheral sensory neuropathy (55.6%), fatigue (51.1%), and alopecia (48.9%); 64.4% of patients had grade ≥3 \ntreatment -related AEs and one death was classified as treatment -\nrelated. Cohort K randomized patients who were ineligible to receive \ncisplatin to first -line enfortumab vedotin, alone or in combination with pembrolizumab.\n249 The primary endpoint of confirmed ORR was 64.5% \n(95% CI, 52.7% –75.1%) for the combination compared to 45.2% (95% \nCI, 33.5% –57.3%) for enfortumab vedotin monotherapy. The median \nDOR was not reached for the combination and was 13.2 months for the monotherapy.  \nSubsequently, enfortumab vedotin and pembrolizumab was investigated in the phase III EV -302 trial, which randomized 886 patients with \npreviously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma \nto either enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab or gemcitabine in \ncombination with either cisplatin or carboplatin.\n250 After a median follow -\nup of 17.2 months, median PFS was significantly longer with enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy \n(12.5 months vs . 6.3 months; HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.38– 0.54; P < .001). \nMedian OS was also significantly longer with enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab (31.5 months vs . 16.1 months; HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–\n0.58; < .001). Confirmed ORR was 67.7% and 44.4% for enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, respectively ( P < .001) , \nwith complete responses obs erved in 29.1% of patients in the \nenfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab group and 12.5% of those in \nthe chemotherapy group . Treatment -related AEs grade ≥ 3 occurred in \n55.9% of patients receiving enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab and 69.5% of those receiving chemotherapy.  \nBased on these results, the combination of pembrolizumab plus enfortumab vedotin is the preferred first -line systemic therapy option for \npatients with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, regardless of whether or not they are eligible for cisplatin. Based on high- level data \nfrom the EV -302 trial, this regimen has been given a category 1 \ndesignation by the panel.

After a median \nfollow- up of 33.6 months, nivolumab plus gemcitabine- cisplatin showed \nlonger median OS compared to gemcitabine- cisplatin alone (21.7 vs . \n18.9 months; HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63– 0.96; P = .02). The median PFS \nwas similar for the two arms (7.9 vs . 7.6 months; P  = .001), but the PFS \ncurves separated over time. At 12 months, the PFS was 34.2% with the \nnivolumab combination compared to 21.8% with chemotherapy alone. \nThe ORR was 57.6% with the nivolumab combination compared to \n43.1% with chemotherapy alone.

Grade 3 or hi gher treatment -related AEs occurred \nin 16% of patients treated with pembrolizumab at the time of data \ncutoff.252 Long- term outcomes of KEYNOTE -052 were similar to the initial analysis with an ORR of 28.6% and a median OS of 11.3 months.\n253 In May 2018, the FDA issued a safety alert for the use of \nfirst-line pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, which warned that early \nreviews of data from two clinical trials (KEYNOTE -361 and IMvigor130) \nshowed decreased survival for patients receiving pembrolizum ab or \natezolizumab as first -line monotherapy compared to those receiving \ncisplatin - or carboplatin- based therapy.254 Based on these data, the \npembrolizumab prescribing information was initially amended to restrict \nfirst-line use to patients who either 1) are not eligible for cisplatin-\ncontaining chemotherapy and whose tumors express PD -L1 as \nmeasured by a combined posit ive score (CPS) of at least 10; or 2) are \nnot eligible for any platinum -containing chemotherapy regardless of PD -\nL1 status.255 Subsequently, the first -line indication was further restricted \nto only patients who were not eligible for any platinum -containing \nchemotherapy, removing eligibility for first -line pembrolizumab from the \nPD-L1–high, platinum -eligible population.256 This amended indication \nwas granted a full (regular) approval by the FDA.  \nThe final approval for pembrolizumab as a first -line therapy for patients \nwho were not eligible for any platinum -containing chemotherapy was \nbased on results of the phase III KEYNOTE -361 trial, which randomized \n1010 patients with previously untreated advanced, unresectable, or metastatic urothelial carcinoma to treatment with pembrolizumab plus \nplatinum -based chemotherapy, pembrolizumab alone, or platinum -\nbased chemotherapy alone.\n257 After a median follow -up of 31.7 months, \nthe addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy did not significantly \nprolong median PFS or OS compared to chemotherapy alone (8.3 vs. \n7.1 months for PFS; P = .0033 and 17.0 vs. 14.3 months for OS; P  = \n.0407). Additionally, analyses for first -line pembrolizumab versus \nchemotherapy alone found that OS was similar both for the total \npopulation (14.3 vs. 15.6 months) as well as those with high PD -L1 \nexpression as measured by a CPS of at least 10 (16.1 vs . 15.2 months).

At the time of the analysis, median PFS in the ITT population was 8.2 months \nin group A and 6.3 months in group C. Median OS was 16.0 months for \ngroup A compared to 13.4 months for group C (HR, 0.83;  0.69– 1.00; one-sided P = .027). For the comparison of group B to group C, the \nmedian OS was 15.7 and 13.1 months, respectively.  \nIn November 2022 the manufacturer announced that they were \nvoluntarily withdrawing the first -line bladder cancer indications for \natezolizumab since atezolizumab plus chemotherapy did not meet the \nco-primary endpoint of OS compared with chemotherapy alone i n the \nIMvigor130 trial.261 Despite this withdrawal, the NCCN Panel has \nmaintained the inclusion of  atezolizumab as a first -line option in patients \nwho are not eligible for cisplatin- containing chemotherapy and whose \ntumors express PD -L1 or who are not eligible for any platinum -\ncontaining chemotherapy regardless of PD -L1 expression (both \nrecommendations are category 2B) . \nOther Non-Platinum Based Chemotherapy Regimens  \nTaxanes have been shown to be active as treatment options for \nurothelial bladder cancer .262-265 Based on these results, several groups \nare exploring two - and three -drug combinations using these agents, \nwith and without cisplatin.

The \nrandomized, phase III JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial showed that avelumab \nsignificantly prolonged OS in all 700 randomized patients compared to \nbest supportive care alone ( median OS , 21.4 vs. 14.3 months; HR, \n0.69; 95% CI, 0.56– 0.86; P = .001).272 The OS benefit was observed in \nall prespecified subgroups, including patients with PD -L1–positive \ntumors. Grade ≥3 AEs were reported in 47.4% of patients treated with \navelumab compared to 25.2% of those with best supportive care alone.  \nBased on these positive OS data in a phase III trial, the NCCN Panel \nhas assigned avelumab maintenance therapy a c ategory 1 \nrecommendation.  \nFor patients treated with gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nivolumab as first -\nline therapy, nivolumab may be used as maintenance therapy.  \nSecond -Line and Subsequent Therapy for Metastatic Disease  \nWith the recent changes to first -line treatment options for metastatic \ndisease, many providers are moving towards immune checkpoint \ninhibitor combinations such as enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab \nas a first -line treatment option. In this evolving paradigm, there is limited evidence to guide optimal selection of second - and subsequent -line \ntherapies following these new first -line regimens.   \nThe FDA has approved the PD -L1 inhibitor avelumab as well as the \nPD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab for the treatment of \nlocally advanced or metastatic urothelial cell carcinoma that has progressed during or after platinum -based chemotherapy or that has \nprogressed within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant \nplatinum -containing chemotherapy, regardless of PD -L1 expression \nlevels. Pembrolizumab has also been approved in combination with \nenfortumab vedotin for treatment of adult patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic urothelial carcinoma and as first -line monotherapy for \npatients who are ineligible to receive a platinum -containing regimen. \nAvelumab has also been approved as maintenance treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that \nhas not progressed with first -line platinum -containing chemotherapy . \nSee First-Line Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Disease, above , for \nmore discussion of these regimens.  \nPembrolizumab  Monotherapy  \nPembrolizumab is a PD -1 inhibitor that has been evaluated as \nsecond- line therapy for patients with bladder cancer who previously \nreceived platinum -based therapy and subsequently progressed or \nmetastasized.273 An open- label, randomized, phase III trial compared \npembrolizumab to chemotherapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine) in \n542 patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma that recurred or \nprogressed after platinum -based chemotherapy. Data from this trial \nshowed a longer median OS for patients treated with pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy (10.3 vs. 7.4 months; P = .002).

AEs led to death in 2.9% of patients treated with \nerdafitinib and 6.9% of those treated with pembrolizumab . \nBased on the phase III THOR trial results, where all patients had \npreviously received an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and 89.1% had \nalso received at least one line of chemotherapy (cisplatin in 50.8% and \ncarboplatin in 29.3%),283 erdafitinib was given a category 1 designation \nin the subsequent -line, post -platinum , post-checkpoint inhibitor setting. \nAlso, since around 11% of patients on the THOR trial had not previously \nreceived platinum -based chemotherapy, erdafitinib is recommended as  \na preferred regimen in the second- line, post -checkpoint inhibitor setting.  \nIn January 2024, the FDA amended the indication for erdafitinib that \nwas previously granted under accelerated approval to provide full \napproval for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial \ncarcinoma with susceptible FGFR3 genetic alterations, whose disease \nhas progressed on or after at least one prior line of systemic therapy.285 \nFurthermore, the FDA indication notes that erdafitinib is not \nrecommended for the treatment of patients who are eligible for and \nhave not received prior PD -1 or PD -L1 inhibitor therapy. In response to \nthe amended FDA indication, the NCCN Panel made the decision to \nmatch the biomarker requirements and specify susceptible FGFR3  \ngenetic alterations ; however , NCCN retains  the erdafitinib \nrecommendation for second- line therapy, post -platinum or other \nchemotherapy without a checkpoint inhibitor.  \nEnfortumab Vedotin -ejfv Monotherapy  \nEnfortumab vedotin is a Nectin- 4-directed antibody –drug conjugate that \nwas evaluated in a global, phase II, single- arm EV-201 study of 125 \npatients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had previously received both a platinum -containing chemotherapy regimen and a PD -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

Similar response \nrates were seen in subgroups of patients with liver metastases and in \nthose with no response to prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The \nmedian DOR  was 7.6 months. Grade ≥3 treatment -related AEs were \nreported in 54% of patients and treatment -related AEs led to dose \nreductions or discontinuation of therapy in 32% and 12% of patients, \nrespectively.286 Subsequently, an open -label, phase III trial of \nenfortumab vedotin (EV- 301) evaluated the therapy in 608 patients with \nadvanced urothelial carcinoma who had previously received both a \nplatinum -containing regimen as well as a checkpoint inhibitor.287 \nPatients were randomized 1:1 to either enfortumab vedotin or the investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel, or \nvinflunine). After a median follow -up of 11.1 months, OS was longer \nwith enfortumab vedotin than with chemotherapy (12.88 vs. 8.97 \nmonths; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56– 0.89; P = .001).

The incidence of grade 3 or greater AEs was \nsimilar in both groups, 51.4% with enfortumab vedotin compared to 49.8% with chemotherapy.  \nEnfortumab vedotin has also been evaluated as a second- line treatment  \noption. Cohort 2 of the phase II EV -201 study enrolled 91 patients who \nhad previously been treated with a PD- 1 or PD -L1 checkpoint inhibitor \ntherapy and were ineligible for a cisplatin -containing regimen.\n288 Of the \n89 patients who received treatment with enfortumab vedotin, the \nconfirmed ORR was 52% (95% CI, 41% –62%) with 20% of patients \nhaving a complete response. Fifty -five percent  of patients had grade 3 \nor higher AEs, with neutropenia, maculopapular rash, and fatigue being \nthe most common. Four deaths were considered to be related to \ntreatment, caused by  acute kidney injury , metabolic acidosis, multiple \norgan dysfunction, and pneumonitis.

In all patients  on the study,  the ORR was \n37.1%, median PFS was 6.9 months, and median OS was 13.4 months. For the 41 patients with bladder cancer, ORR was 39.0%, median PFS \nwas 7.0 months, and median OS was 12.8 months. For the 75 patients with HER2 IHC 3+ expression, the ORR was 61.3%, median PFS was \n11.9 months, and median OS was 21.1 months. For the patients with \nbladder cancer on this study, 65.9% had IHC 3+ HER2 overexpression. \nGrade ≥3 drug -related AEs were observed in 40.8% of all patients on \nthe study, including 10.5% with adjudicated drug- related interstitial lung \ndisease, of which 3 patients (1.1%) died.    \nNCCN Recommendations for Systemic Therapy of Metastatic \nDisease  \nBased on the available data, the NCCN Panel recommends that \npatients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are eligible for a \ncisplatin -containing regimen receive either  a cisplatin -based regimen or \npembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin as first -line \ntherapy , with pembrolizumab plus enfortumab vedotin being the \npreferred option. First -line cisplatin -based regimens include GC, \nddMVAC  with growth factor support , or gemcitabine- cisplatin plus nivolumab. All four of these regimens  are supported by category 1 data. \nA patient who is ineligible for cisplatin, but eligible for carboplatin, may  \nreceive gemcitabine in combination with carboplatin first -line, although \npembrolizumab plus enfortumab vedotin is the preferred option \nregardless of cisplatin- eligibility . If there is no progression on a first -line \nplatinum -containing chemotherapy, avelumab maintenance therapy is \npreferred (category 1) , unless nivolumab was included in the first -line \nregimen, in which case nivolumab maintenance therapy should be used.   \nFirst-line treatment options that may be useful under certain \ncircumstances for patients who are not eligible for cisplatin- containing \nchemotherapy  include pembrolizumab for patients who are not eligible \nfor any platinum -containing chemotherapy and  atezolizumab for \npatients whose tumors express PD -L1 or in patients who are not eligible \nfor any platinum -containing chemotherapy regardless of PD -L1 \nexpression (both atezolizumab recommendations are category 2B). \nHowever, for these patients, enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab \nshould be prioritized if it can be given.  Several chemotherapy regimens, \nincluding gemcitabine, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, or the combination of ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and gemcitabine may also be \nappropriate first -line treatment options for some patients.  \nClinical trial enrollment is recommended by the NCCN Panel for all patients when appropriate, but is strongly recommended for second -line \nand subsequent therapies since data for locally advanced or metastatic \ndisease treated with subsequent -line therapy ar e highly variable. The \navailable second- line options depend on what was given as first -line. If \na chemotherapy  regimen, without a checkpoint inhibitor,  was given first -\nline, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, avelumab, erdafitinib (if eligible on the \nbasis of FGFR3  genetic alteration) , or enfortumab vedotin are preferred \nsecond- line treatment options.

These pathologic entities include \nmixed histology, pure squamous , adenocarcinoma, small cell tumors , \nurachal carcinoma, or primary bladder sarcoma. Depending on the \npathologic findings, perioperative chemotherapy may or may not be \nrecommended. The regimens effective for urothelial carcinoma \nhistologies have limited efficacy for patients with non- urothelial  \ncarcinomas.  \nThese individuals are often treated based on the identified histology . In \ngeneral, patients with non- urothelial invasive disease are treated with \ncystectomy, although those with certain urachal tumors require \ncomplete urachal resection (en bloc resection of the urachal ligament \nwith the umbilicus) or may be appropriately treated with partial \ncystectomy. F or example, adenocarcinomas are managed surgically \nwith radical or partial cystectomy and with individualiz ed adjuvant \nchemotherapy and r adiotherapy for ma ximum benefit.  Pure squamous  \ncell tumors  are treated by  cystectomy, chemoradiotherapy , or agents \ncommonly used for squamous cell carcinoma of other sites such as \n5-FU or taxanes . However, overall experience with chemotherapy in \nnon-urothelial carcinom as is limited.   \nData are limited to support perioperative chemotherapy for \nnon-urothelial carcinomas; however, neoadjuvant chemotherapy may \nbenefit patients with small cell carcinoma of the bladder and is recommended by the panel for any patient with small -cell component histology with localized disease regardless of stage.\n307-311 In addition, a \nretrospective analysis has shown that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may have a modest benefit for other variant histologies.\n312 In patients with \nnon-urothelial carcinomas of any stage, no data support the use of \nadjuvant chemotherapy, although the risk for  relapse may be high.  \nSome of the general principles of management applicable to urothelial \ncarcinomas are appropriate with minor variations.  \nPatients with small cell carcinoma of the bladder are best treated with \ninitial systemic therapy (see NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung \nCancer ) followed by either RT  or cystectomy as consolidation, if there is \nno metastatic disease.313 In addition to the regimens recommended for \nsmall cell lung cancer, a regimen alternating ifosfamide plus doxorubicin with etoposide plus cisplatin has also been tested specifically for small \ncell bladder cancer and found to be effective both as neoadjuvant and \nmetastatic therapy.\n309 The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab \nhas also been tested in a phase II trial for advanced rare genitourinary malignancies, including the BUTCVH cohort of 19 patients with bladder \nor upper tract tumors of variant histology (3 patients with small cell \nbladder cancer).\n314 ORR for the BUTCVH cohort was 37%, with two \ncomplete responses. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is also an option for these patients.\n315 Primary bladder sarcomas are treated as per the \nNCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma.  \nUpper Tract  Urothelial Carcinoma \nUpper tract tumors, including those that originate in the renal pelvis or in the ureter, are relatively uncommon.\n316 The treatment recommendations \ndiscussed in this section are based on the most common histology of upper tract tumors, urothelial carcinoma.

MS-40 NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nRenal Pelvis  Tumors  \nTumors that develop in the renal pelvis may be identified during \nevaluation of hematuria or a renal mass. In the latter case, renal pelvic \ntumors must be distinguished from the more typical adenocarcinomas \nthat originate in the renal parenchyma. These  tumors may also be \ndetected during an assessment to pinpoint the source of a positive \ncytology in a negative cystoscopy with a retrograde ureteropyelography . \nWorkup  \nThe evaluation of a patient with a suspected renal pelvic tumor should \ninclude cystoscopy and imaging of the upper tract collecting system with \nCT or MR urography; renal ultrasound or CT without contrast with retrograde ureteropyelography; or ureteroscopy  with biopsy ; or \npercutaneous biopsy;  and/or selective washings . A chest radiograph  or \nCT can help evaluate for possible metastasis  and assess for any \ncomorbid diseases. Urine cytology obtained from a urine sample or during a cy stoscopy may help identify carcinoma cells. Hematologic, \nrenal, and hepatic function should also be evaluated. Additional imaging studies , such as a renal scan or bone scan,  may be needed if indicated \nby the test results or by the presence of specific symptoms.  Recent \nevidence has suggested a high prevalence of Lynch syndrome in \npatients with  UTUC.\n8,317 Therefore, it is recommended to take a \nthorough family history for all patients with UTUC and consider \nevaluation for Lynch syndrome for those who are at high risk  (see \nNCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: \nColorectal  for information on the criteria and strategies for evaluation of \nLynch syndrome).  \nPrimary Treatment  \nIn general, the primary form of treatment for renal pelvic tumors is surgery.  Well- differentiated tumors of low grade may be managed with a  \nnephroureterectomy with a bladder cuff with or without perioperative \nintravesical chemotherapy. Several  prospective, randomized, clinical \ntrials have shown a reduction of risk of bladder recurrence following nephroureterectomy when a single postoperative intravesical instillation \nof chemotherapy was administered.\n318-320 While the studies have \ngenerally looked at early instillation (within 24 –48 hours of \nsurgery ),319,320 some centers are delaying intravesical instillation of \nchemotherapy by up to 1 week  to administer a cystogram confirming \nthere is no perforation.  While mitomycin is most commonly used, \ngemcitabine is an option for select patients.  As an alternate to \nnephroureterectomy , a nephron- sparing procedure through a \ntransureteroscopic approach or a percutaneous approach may be used, \nwith or without postsurgical intrapelvic chemotherapy or BCG  (see \nEndoscopic Management of UTUC ).  \nHigh-grade tumors or those that are large and /or invade the renal \nparenchyma are managed through nephroureterectomy with a bladder \ncuff and regional lymphadenectomy  with or without perioperative \nintravesical chemotherapy . Decline in renal function following surgery \nmay preclude adjuvant therapy. Hence, in selected patients, cisplatin -\nbased neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended.  The data \nsupporting the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for UTUC are more \nlimited than for urothelial bladder cancer, although a growing body of \nevidence suggests that this approach may be beneficial to certain \npatients. A phase II trial demonstrated the safety and activity of \naccelerated MVAC as neoadjuvant therapy for high- grade UTUC with a \npathologic complete response rate of 14% and a final pathologic stage \nof ypT1 or less in more than 60% of patients.321 Systematic reviews and \nmeta-analys es have also reported that  neoadjuvant chemotherapy may \nalso improve outcomes compared to no perioperative treatment , \nalthough more prospective data are needed.322-325 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:26:25 PM.

MS-41 NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nIf metastatic disease is documented , or comorbid conditions  that do not \nallow for surgical resection are present , treatment should include \nsystemic therapy  with regimens similar to those used for metastatic \nurothelial bladder tumors.  \nIn positive upper tract cytology but negative imaging and biopsy studies, \ntreatment remains controversial and appropriate management is \ncurrently poorly defined. Frequent monitoring for disease is necessary \nfor these patients.  \nEndoscopic Management of UTUC  \nNephron- sparing endoscopic treatment is a treatment option for certain \npatients with UTUC, depending on clinical and pathologic criteria and/or \ncomorbid conditions that may contraindicate nephroureterectomy. \nFavorable clinical and pathologic criteria for nephron preservation \ninclude a papillary, unifocal, low -grade tumor, and size less than 1.5 cm, \nwhere cross -sectional imaging shows no concern for invasive \ndisease.316,326 Although there are no randomized controlled trials, \nsystematic reviews of retrospective studies have shown that nephron-\nsparing approaches show similar outcomes compared to \nnephroureterectomy for these patients.327,328 In addition, patients with \nbilateral disease, solitary functional or anatomic kidney, chronic kidney \ndisease, or renal insufficiency are contraindicated from \nnephroureterectomy and should receive nephron -sparing \ntreatment.316,329 Long- term surveillance (>5 years), including urine \ncytology and cross -sectional urography or endoscopic visualization, is \nrequired following nephron- sparing treatment due to a high risk of \ndisease recurrence.316  \nMitomycin for pyelocalyceal solution (also called UGN- 101 or mitomycin \ngel) has been FDA -approved for treatment of adult patients with low -\ngrade UTUC.330 This approval was based on OLYMPUS , a sin gle-arm, \nmulticenter , phase 3  trial of  patients with treatment -naïve or recurrent low-grade noninvasive UTUC with at least one measurable papillary \ntumor above the ureteropelvic junction who were scheduled to receive  6 \nweekly instillations of mitomycin ureteral gel via retrograde catheter to \nthe renal pelvis and calyces .331 Of the 71 patients who received at least \none dose of mitomycin gel, 59% showed a complete response at the primary disease evaluation visit (95% CI, 47% –71%; P < .0001) . \nDurability of response was estimated at 84.2% 12 months after the primary disease evaluation,  with a median time to recurrence of 13 \nmonths. The most common all -cause AEs in this study were ureteric \nstenosis, urinary tract infections, hematuria, flank pain, and nausea.  \nBased on these data, the NCCN Panel recommends mitomycin gel be considered for use in this setting, with the caveat that complete or near \ncomplete endoscopic resection or ablation is recommended prior to gel application. Treatment with mitomycin gel is most appropriate for \npatients with a s olitary residual, low -grade, UTUC tumor that is low \nvolume (eg, 5– 15 mm) and who are not candidates for or are not \nseeking nephroureterectomy as a definitive treatment.  Long -term follow-\nup of OLYMPUS showed a durable response to mitomycin ureteral gel \nin those who had a complete response to induction therapy (56% \nremained in complete response after 12 months).\n332 Fifty percent  of \nthose who did not receive any maintenance instillations of mitomycin gel \nand 59% of those who received at least one maintenance instillation \nremained in complete response at 12 months.  \nAdjuvant Treatment and Follow -up  \nSubsequent management is dictated by the extent of disease at \nsurgery. Tumors that are pT0 or pT1 should be followed up with serial \ncystoscopies at 3- month intervals for the first year and, if negative, at \nlonger intervals . Cytology may also be considered at similar intervals for \nhigh- grade tumors. Tumors that are pT0 or pT1 and were treated with \nnephron- sparing surgery  should also be followed up with ureteroscopy \nand upper tract imaging at 3 - to 12 -month intervals.

Three- year event -free \nestimates were 71% for those who received adjuvant chemotherapy \nand 46% for surveillance. Forty -four percent of those who started \nchemother apy had grade 3 or higher treatment -emergent AEs \ncompared to 4% with surveillance.  Nivolumab has also been \ninvestigated for adjuvant treatment of UTUC as the above- mentioned  \nCheckMate 274 trial included 21% of patients with UTUC (96 renal \npelvis and 53 ureter).185 Results from the full trial population are detailed \nin the section on Adjuvant Systemic Therapy  under Muscle Invasive \nUrothelial Bladder Cancer , above.  While the authors note that the \nanalysis shows the possibility of a larger effect size for bladder \ncompared to UTUC, they caution that the trial was designed to measure \nthe entire trial population and that further analyses are planned to test \nthe effects on these subgroups.  \nBased on these data, adjuvant  therapy should be discussed for patients \nwith pT3–4 or nodal disease. If no platinum -based neoadjuvant \ntreatment was given, adjuvant treatment with a platinum -based regimen \nshould be discussed. Alternatively, adjuvant nivolumab may be \nconsidered (category 2B) . If platinum -based neoadjuvant therapy was \ngiven and the disease was determined to be ypT2– 4 or ypN+ after \nsurgery, adjuvant nivolumab may be considered, although adjuvant \ntherapy would be most appropriate for patients who value the opportunity to delay recurrence, and who accept the risk of side effects, even if the chance for cure was not improved in this situation. Follow -up \nshould be the same as pT0/pT1 disease with the addition of chest imaging and a stronger recommendation for cytology . \nThere have been some data on the use of adjuvant RT or chemoradiotherapy following nephroureterectomy for UTUC. One study \nreported on local recurrence patterns and risk factors in 389 patients \nwith UTUC who were treated with radical nephroureterectomy.\n335 This \nstudy found that adjuvant RT reduced local recurrence rates (HR, \n0.177; 95% CI, 0.064– 0.493; P = .001). However, another retrospective \nstudy of 198 patients with pT3, N0, M0 UTUC found no significant differences in 2 -year OS, DSS, or RFS for those who received adjuvant \nRT compared to those who did not.\n336 In addition, a retrospective review \nof 31 patients with UTUC who were treated with RT, with or without \nconcurrent chemotherapy, following attempted curative resection found \nthat 5- year actuarial OS and DSS were longer in the patients who \nreceived adjuvant  cisplatin -based chemoradiotherapy compared to \nthose who received RT alone.337 In this study, 5 -year actuarial OS was \n27% for RT alone compared to 67% for chemoradiotherapy ( P = .01) \nand DSS was 41% for RT compared to 76% for chemotherapy ( P = \n.06). Based on the lack of data supporting this approach for UTT, \nadjuvant RT is not recommended.  \nUrothelial Carcinoma of the Ureter  \nUreteral tumors may develop de novo or in patients who have \nundergone successful treatment for superficial tumors that originate in \nthe bladder. The presentation varies as a function of disease extent. \nUreteral tumors may be identified in patients who have a positive \ncytology with a negative cystoscopy in whom selective catheterization of the ureters is performed. More extensive lesions may result in pain or \nobstruction.

Neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy may be considered in selected patients, such as when the degree of invasiveness is established before definitive surgery.\n322,338 \nTumors that originate in the upper ureter occasionally can be managed \nendoscopically , if low- grade,  but more commonly are treated with  \nnephroureterectomy with a bladder cuff , with or without perioperative \nintravesical chemotherapy,  plus regional lymphadenectomy for \nhigh- grade tumors . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered in \nselect patients, including patients with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy; \nbulky (>3 cm) high- grade tumor; sessile histology; or suspected \nparenchymal invasion. A portion of the bladder is removed to ensure complete removal of the entire intramural ureter.  \nTumors that originate in the mid portion may also be managed \ndifferently depending on grade. Low-grade tumors may  be managed by \nendoscopic resection or  excision , with or without perioperative \nintravesical chemotherapy,  followed by  ureteroureterostomy , or \nsegmental or complete ureterectomy, or ileal ureter interposition may \nalso be an option in highly selected patients. H igh-grade lesions are \ngenerally managed with nephroureterectomy with a bladder cuff , with or \nwithout perioperative intravesical chemotherapy,  and regional lymphadenectomy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be considered in \nselect patients.  \nDistal ureteral tumors may be managed with a distal ureterectomy and \nregional lymphadenectomy if high grade followed by reimplantation of \nthe ureter (preferred if clinically feasible) , with or without perioperative \nintravesical chemotherapy . Other primary treatment options include \nendoscopic resection for low -grade tumors , or, in some cases, a \nnephroureterectomy with a bladder cuff , and regional lymphadenectomy \nif high grade. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be considered for select \npatients with distal ureteral tumors following distal ureterectomy or the \nnephroureterectomy with bladder cuff.  \nFollow -up  \nThe final pathologic stage is used to guide subsequent management, as \nis the case for tumors that originate in other sites. No adjuvant therapy \nis advised for lesions that are pT1 or less, but serial follow -up of the \nurothelial tracts or remaining unit (as previously described under Renal \nPelvis Tumors ) is recommended.  \nPatients with more extensive disease are advised to consider adjuvant \ntreatment, depending on the disease stage, whether neoadjuvant \ntreatment was given, and patient preference.  Please see Adjuvant \nTreatment and Follow -up for Renal Pelvis Tumors , above, for more \ndiscussion of the recommendations and data on adjuvant therapy for \nUTUC.  \nUrothelial Carcinomas of the Prostate \nUrothelial (transitional cell) carcinomas of the prostate represent a distinct entity with a unique staging system. In this respect, t hey must  \nbe distinguished from urothelial carcinomas of bladder origin that invade \ninto the prostate through the bladder wall .

MS-44 NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \ntreatment of bladder cancer. Similar to  tumors originating in other sites \nof the urothelium, management of prostate urothelial carcinomas is \nbased on the extent of disease with particular reference to the urethra, \nduct, acini, and stroma.  \nWorkup  \nThe evaluation of a suspected urothelial carcinoma of the prostate includes a digital rectal examination (DRE), cysto scopy with bladder \nbiopsy, and  TURP that includes the prostatic stroma. Prostate -specific \nantigen testing should be performed. Multiple stromal biopsies are \nadvised and, if the DRE is abnormal, additional needle biopsies may be \nrequired in selected patients to exclude primary adenocarcinoma of the \nprostate. Upper  tract collecting system imaging  is also recommended.  \nPrimary Treatment  \nPending histologic confirmation, tumors that are limited to the mucosal \nprostatic urethra with no acinar or stromal invasion can be managed \nwith TURP  and intravesical BCG , with follow- up similar to that for \nsuperficial disease of the bladder. A systematic review and meta-\nanalysis of intravesical BCG for treatment of noninvasive urothelial \ncarcinoma of the prostate found that the complete response rate for prostatic disease was 88% (95% CI, 0.81 –0.96).\n339 If local recurrence is \nseen, cystoprostatectomy with or without urethrectomy is recommended. Patients with tumors that invade the duct s, acini, or \nstroma should undergo an additional workup with chest radiograph  or \nCT, and abdominal/pelvic CT if necessary, to exclude metastatic \ndisease, and then  a cystoprostatectomy with or without urethrectomy \nshould be performed . Based on data extrapolated from bladder cancer \ntherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended in patients with \nstromal invasion.\n153-155 Adjuvant chemotherapy may be advised for  \nstromal invasion after  primary treatment  if neoadjuvant therapy was not \ngiven. Alternatively, TURP  and intravesical  BCG may be offered to patients with only ductal and acini invasion. Local r ecurrences in \npatients undergoing TURP and BCG therapy are treated with \ncystoprostatectomy with or without urethrectomy.  \nPrimary Carcinoma of the Urethra \nPrimary carcinoma that arises in the urethra is rare. Unlike for bladder \ncancer, squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histologic \nsubtype for urethral cancer.340 The 5- year OS is 42%.341,342 Stage and \ndisease location are the most important prognostic factors for male \npatients, while tumor size and histology are prognostically significant for \nfemale patients.340,342 Unfortunately, there is a lack of robust, \nprospective data to support treatment decisions due to disease rarity. \nTreatment recommendations typically encompass all of the respective \nhistologies (ie, squamous, transitional, adenocarcinomas) with the \ntreatme nt approach based on location (ie, proximal vs. distal urethral \ntumors).  \nWorkup  \nA cystourethroscopy should be performed if carcinoma of the urethra is \nsuspected. This includes EUA and transurethral or transvaginal biopsy. \nChest x -ray or CT  and MRI of the pelvis are recommended to evaluate \nthe extent of the disease.  \nIf palpable inguinal lymph nodes are present, a chest/abdom en/pelvi s \nCT and lymph node biopsy should be performed.  \nTreatment  \nPatients with CIS , Ta, or T1 disease should have a repeat transurethral \nor transvaginal resection. In select cases, TURBT is followed by \nintraurethral therapy with BCG, mitomycin, or gemcitabine. A total \nurethrectomy may be considered if the patient has undergone a radical  \ncystectomy and cutaneous diversion.

MS-45 NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nBladder Cancer  \n \nTreatment for T2 disease is based on patient anatomy  and tumor \nlocation. For patients  assigned male at birth with pendulous urethra, a \ndistal urethrectomy or partial penectomy are viable options. Patients \nmay consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy (category 2B) or \nchemoradiation (category 2A) before a urethrectomy. Patients who have \npositive margins may undergo addit ional surgery or radiation, preferably \nwith chemotherapy. At recurrence, options include systemic therapy, total penectomy, radiation, or a combinat ion. Patients with T2 tumors in \nthe bulbar urethra should undergo urethrectomy with or without cystoprostatectomy. Adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation may be \nconsidered if pT3, pT4, or nodal disease is found. Recurrent cases may \nbe treated with systemic ther apy and/or radiation.  \nInitial treatment options for patients  assigned female at birth with T2 \ntumors include chemoradiation or urethrectomy with cystectomy , with \norgan- sparing approaches used when feasible in appropriately selected \ncases .\n139,140 Partial urethrectomy  is possible in a minority of cases , \ndepending on tumor location,  and has been associated with a high local  \nrecurrence rate.343 At recurrence, the patient may receive systemic \ntherapy or chemoradiotherapy (both category 2A) or pelvic exenteration \n(category 2B).  Pelvic exenteration for T2 urethral cancer consists of en \nbloc removal of the urethra, bladder, and anterior vagina.  \nA multimodal treatment approach (ie, surgery, systemic therapy, \nradiation) is common for advanced disease.  A cohort study reported a \n72% response rate with the following treatment scheme before surgery: cisplatin, gemcitabine, and ifosfamide for squamous cell carcinoma; \n5-FU, gemcitabine, and cisplatin- based regimens for adenocarcinoma; \nand MVAC for urothelial tumors.\n344 Combined chemoradiation with 5 -FU \nand mitomycin C has shown efficacy in a series of male patients with \nsquamous cell carcinoma of the urethra.345 Patients  undergoing surgery \nafter chemoradiation had a higher 5- year DFS rate (72%) than those receiving chemoradiation alone (54%). If systemic therapy is used, the choice of regimen should be based on histology.  \nPatients with T3 or T4 disease but no clinical nodes should receive \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy  (if urothelial carcinoma)  followed by \nconsolidative surgery or , if ineligible for standard systemic \nchemotherapy,  radiation or chemoradiation with or without consolidative \nsurgery. Surgery alone is an option for non -urothelial histologies. If \nnode- positive , chemo radiation is the preferred treatment for squamous \ncell carcinoma. Systemic therapy or chemoradiotherapy with or without consolidative surgery are also treat ment options. At recurrence, the \npatient may undergo pelvic exenteration (category 2B) with or without ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy and/or chemoradiotherapy. Pelvic \nexenteration for T3 urethral cancer consists of urethrectomy, \ncystectomy, and either a prostatectomy or anterior vaginectomy with \nhysterectomy, as applicable. For highly local advanced T4 tumors, the \nposterior vagina and rectum may also need to be removed en bloc  with \nthe specimen. Systemic therapy is a category 2B option.  \nPatients with distant metastases should receive similar treatment as metastatic bladder cancer. Systemic therapies include chemotherapy \nand targeted therapies  as subsequent -line options. However, it should \nbe noted that checkpoint inhibitors have only been evaluated in patients \nwith urothelial histology.  \nSummary  \nUrothelial  tumors represent a spectrum of diseases with a range of \nprognos es. After  a tumor is diagnos ed anywhere within the urothelial \ntract, the patient remains at risk for developing a new lesion at the same \nor a different location and with a  similar or more advanced stage.

Within each category of disease, more refined methods \nto determine prognosis and guide management, based on molecular \nstaging, are under development  with the goal of  optimizing each  \npatient’s likelihood of cure and chance for organ preservation.  \nFor patients with more extensive disease, newer treatments typically \ninvolve combined modality approaches using recent ly developed \nsurgical procedures or three -dimensional treatment planning for more \nprecise delivery of RT . Although these are not appropriate in all cases, \nthey offer the promise of an improved quality of life and prolonged \nsurvival.  \nWithin the category of metastatic disease, several new agents and \ncombination regimens have been studied and seem to be superior to \nthose that were previously considered standard therapies. In particular, \nimmune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody -drug conjugates, and targeted \ntherapies have emerged as new options for the treatment of metastatic bladder cancer. Experts surmise that the treatment of u rothelial tumors \nwill evolve rapidly over the next few years, with improved outcomes across all disease stages.
