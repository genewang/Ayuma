T wo pathways of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and SCC have \nbeen identified in the vulva: HPV-associated and HPV-independent. \n• A meta-analysis showed that HPV-associated SCC had a better prognosis than HPV-independent SCC.\nHPV-Associated\n• HPV-associated SCC frequently occurs in younger patients, is frequently multifocal, is associated with classic VIN, and can be seen in \nassociation with additional sites of lower genital tract squamous neoplasia.\n• Immunohistochemistry (IHC) shows strong, diffuse, block-like positive nuclear and cytoplasmic staining with p16 and wild-type p53 \n(heterogeneous staining pattern).\nHPV-Independent\n• HPV-independent VIN and SCC are identified in the setting of chronic vulvar inflammatory disorders such as lichen sclerosus. \n• HPV-independent SCC is split into two main groups: those associated with TP53 mutations and those with wild-type TP53 status. \n\u0017The p53 abnormal, HPV-independent SCC usually occurs in older patients, is unifocal, and is associated with differentiated VIN (dVIN).\n ◊IHC usually shows aberrant p53 staining (widespread, strong nuclear expression or complete absence/null expression) and patchy \n(negative) p16 staining. \n ◊The p53 abnormal SCCs have the worst clinical outcomes of the three molecular categories (HPV positive, HPV-negative/p53 mutant, and \nHPV-negative p53 wild-type).5\n• Assessing the presence and depth of invasion in vulvar SCC can be challenging. \n• Depth of invasion (measured in mm) has previously been from the epithelial-stromal junction of the adjacent, most superficial dermal papilla \nto the deepest point of invasion6 (Figure 1, method B). Alternative ways to measure the depth of invasion have recently been proposed7 \n(Figure 1, method A).

Recent studies have questioned the \ntraditional (8-mm) pathologic free margin and suggested that a smaller margin may be acceptable, particularly to preserve sensitive areas on \nthe vulva and maintain sexual function.6,7,8\n• The definition of a pathologic close margin has also varied from 1–8 mm for formalin-fixed tissue.9,10 In the setting of a close margin for \ninvasive cancer at primary resection, observation with regular close follow-up is reasonable. Re-excision should be considered in cases with \npositive margin for cancer.9,11 Adjuvant local radiation therapy (RT) is another alternative.12 The risk-benefit ratio and morbidity of these \napproaches must be considered and individualized in each patient. The survival advantage of re-excision and adjuvant vulvar radiation \nremains to be determined.10 \n• Positive margins that involve the urethra, anus, or vagina may not be resectable without incurring significant potential morbidity and adverse \nimpact on patient quality of life. \n• Other factors including nodal status should be considered in the decision whether to perform subsequent surgery. Re-excision of close or \npositive vulvar tumor margins may not be beneficial in patients with metastases to the inguinal nodes that require treatment with EBRT  \n± chemotherapy after surgery.

Inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy removes the LNs along the \ninguinal ligament, within the proximal femoral triangle, and deep to the cribriform fascia.\n• LN status is the most important determinant of survival.14 \n• Historically, en bloc resection of the vulvar tumor and complete bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (resection of superficial inguinal \nand deep femoral nodes) were performed, but this approach was associated with significant morbidity .15\n• The current standard involves resection of the vulvar tumor and LNs through separate incisions.15\n• The choice of vulvar tumor resection technique depends on the size and extent of the primary lesion and may include partial or total \nvulvectomy, and the depth of resection may be superficial/skinning, simple, or radical.16\n• The depth of the resection for radical vulvectomy is to the urogenital diaphragm, or median perineal fascia or periosteum of pubic bone.17\n• There are no prospective trials comparing the resection techniques above. Retrospective data suggest there is no difference in recurrence \noutcome between radical partial vulvectomy compared with radical total vulvectomy.\n• For a unifocal primary vulvar tumor that is <4 cm in diameter, located ≥2 cm from the vulvar midline and in the setting of clinically negative \ninguinofemoral LNs, a unilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy or SLNB is appropriate (Principles of Surgery: Inguinofemoral Sentinel \nLymph Node Biopsy [VULVA-C 4 of 6]).18\n• For a primary vulvar tumor located within 2 cm from or crossing the vulvar midline, a bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy18 or SLNB \nis recommended. \n• Inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy or SLNB can be omitted in patients with stage IA primary disease with clinically negative groins due to a \n<1% risk of lymphatic metastases.18PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY: SURGICAL STAGING\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

It is most commonly injected 2–4 hours prior to the vulvectomy and \nlymphadenectomy procedure. A preoperative lymphoscintigraphy may be performed to aid in anatomically locating the sentinel node. \nThe blue dye most commonly used is Isosulfan Blue 1%. Approximately 4 cc of dye is injected peritumorally using a four-point injection \ntechnique at 2, 5, 7, and 10 o’clock. The blue dye is injected in 4 quadrants intradermally around the leading edges of the tumor .\n• It is recommended that the SLN procedure is performed prior to the excision of the vulvar tumor, so as not to disrupt the lymphatic network \nbetween the primary vulvar tumor and the inguinofemoral LN basin. Additionally, the injected blue dye will only transiently localize (ie, for \n30–60 minutes) in the first group of nodes that correspond to the primary vulvar tumors. Indocyanine green (ICG) with technetium has also \nbeen used for SLN mapping in vulvar cancer with encouraging results.\n• Use of a gamma probe to detect the injected radiocolloid within the inguinofemoral region is recommended prior to making the groin \nincision in order to tailor the location and size of the incision. \n• A side-specific complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy is recommended if an ipsilateral SLN is not detected. \n• Completion inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy is the preferred approach in the presence of metastases >2 mm in diameter in the SLNs.28\n• For lateralized and near-midline tumors with unilateral SLN metastasis, unilateral groin treatment by either inguinofemoral \nlymphadenectomy or RT is acceptable.\n• For midline tumors with unilateral SLN metastasis, unilateral groin treatment can be performed if the contralateral groin has negative \nsentinel node or negative inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy.29,30\n• Selective frozen section of sentinel node may guide the intraoperative decision regarding need for completion unilateral or bilateral \ninguinofemoral lymphadenectomy.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

In general, tumor-directed EBRT is directed to \nthe vulva and/or inguinofemoral, external, and internal iliac nodal regions. Brachytherapy can sometimes be used as a boost to anatomically \namenable primary tumors. Careful attention should be taken to ensure adequate tumor coverage by combining clinical examination, imaging \nfindings, and appropriate nodal volumes at risk to define the target volume. For example, invasion into the anus above the pectinate line \nwould necessitate coverage of the perirectal nodes.1,2 \n• Ensure coverage of gross tumor burden with margin. In highly selected cases where only a superficial vulvar target is to be treated, an \nenface electron beam may be used. \n• Utilization of imaging studies are an important part of the treatment planning process. The use of CT-based treatment planning and \nconformal blocking is considered the standard of care for EBRT.\n• Historically, a widely disparate range of approaches has been described. In an attempt to better standardize RT use and techniques, a recent \ninternational survey, with consequent recommendations, has been reported.3\n• Acute effects during RT (eg, diarrhea, bladder irritation, fatigue, mucocutaneous reaction) are expected to some degree in most patients, and \ncan be further accentuated by concurrent chemotherapy. These toxicities should be aggressively managed (eg, local skin care, symptomatic \nmedications), and treatment breaks should be avoided or minimized. Many patients may develop an overgrowth of Candida albicans; \ntreatment with oral and local antifungal agents will markedly reduce skin reaction. If a bacterial infection develops, prompt recognition and \nappropriate treatment is essential. These acute effects generally resolve several weeks after completion of radiation. \n• Postoperative adjuvant treatment should be initiated as soon as adequate healing is achieved, preferably within 6–8 weeks. \nVULVA-D \n1 OF 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

Radio-opaque markers should be placed on key landmarks at the time of simulation to assist in definition of the primary \ntarget volume.\n\u0017MRI and/or PET imaging may be fused with the planning CT to aid in the delineation of gross disease. Consensus guidelines for clinical \ntarget volume (CTV) definition have been developed and are recommended when developing a treatment plan.3 \n\u0017Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is recommended for better dose delivery to target and sparing of target, with 2D/3D technique reserved for \nurgent/emergent treatment starts with prompt transition to IMRT in definitive cases, or for palliative treatment.\n• Indications\n\u0017Postoperative indications for treating the primary site include close/positive margin, LVSI, and >5-mm depth of invasion. Additionally, groin \ninvolvement may be considered a relative indication to include the primary site. Use of a midline block (to avoid toxicity to sensitive central \nstructures) in stage III–IV vulvar cancer has been associated with a high rate of central recurrence and is usually discouraged. Conversely , \nthere may be clinical situations in which it is desirable to cover the primary site only and avoid the nodes.\n\u0017In both the locally advanced and postoperative settings, especially when there are ≥2 LNs pathologically positive, the bilateral inguinal and \npelvic lymphatic regions are typically included in the radiotherapy CTV.\n\u0017If there are clinically or radiographically suspicious LNs (≥1), then bilateral pelvic and groin radiotherapy is recommended.  \n\u0017If the groin is clinically node negative, but pathologically node positive (by sentinel node procedure or dissection), then the number of \npositive nodes, size of LN metastasis, features of the primary lesion, and extent of surgery may impact recommendations for adjuvant RT .4 \n ◊If there is a single positive SLN and no completion inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy done, then adjuvant RT or chemoradiation \nis recommended regardless of size of LN metastasis. If the single positive node is ≥2 mm, adjuvant RT alone to 50 Gy is inferior to \ninguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Therefore, in these cases, consider adding chemotherapy or increasing radiation dose to 54–60 Gy or \nboth.\n ◊If there are ≥2 pathologic positive nodes or extracapsular extension (ECE) is present, then adjuvant RT or chemoradiation is \nrecommended. \n ◊In the setting of a single pathologic LN without ECE and a completion inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFLD), there are scenarios \nwhere adjuvant RT or chemoradiation may be favored such as larger primary tumor size, larger LN size, inadequate LN dissection, LN \nratio >20%, presence of LVSI, or radiographically suspicious findings. We favor evaluation of these patients by a radiation oncologist and \nconsideration of postoperative PET imaging to help with decision-making.\n ◊There are some data that suggest the contralateral groin could be observed in patients with documented ipsilateral drainage, a lateralized \nlesion, and small primary tumor.\nVULVA-D  \n2 OF 5ReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

Any gross vulvar disease should be contoured as a gross tumor \nvolume (GTV) and include any visible and/or palpable extension. The vulvar CTV target is defined as the GTV or tumor bed plus the adjacent \nskin, mucosa, and subcutaneous tissue of the vulva excluding bony tissue. A wire placed clinically to define the vulvar skin borders and the \nGTV during CT simulation is essential. In addition, a marker on the anus, urethra, clitoris, and the wiring of any scars will aid in planning. \n• To ensure adequate distal margin on the vulvar target volume, a “false structure” or bolus should be placed over the vulva for treatment \nplanning purposes. Doses to the target areas should be confirmed using thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) at first treatment. \n• Symmetrical geometric expansions on the vessels should NOT be used for the inguinofemoral nodes. The inguinofemoral nodal CTV will \nextend laterally from the inguinofemoral vessels to the medial border of the sartorius and rectus femoris muscles, posteriorly to the anterior \nvastus medialis muscle, and medially to the pectineus muscle or 2.5–3 cm medially from the vessels. Anteriorly, the volume should extend \nto the anterior border of the sartorius muscle (the most anterior muscle on the lateral inguinofemoral border). The caudal extent of the \ninguinofemoral nodal basin is the top of the lesser trochanter of the femur.2 \n• The pelvic nodal CTV is the vasculature of the bilateral external iliac, obturator, and internal iliac nodal regions with a minimum of 7 mm of \nsymmetrical expansion excluding bone and muscle. \n• The groin CTV volume will not extend outside the skin and should be trimmed by 3 mm in the absence of skin involvement (with skin \ninvolvement, the CTV should extend to the skin with bolus material applied during treatment). Planning target volume (PTV) expansion is \nthen 7–10 mm. \n• Image-guided IMRT is an essential component of treatment (to account for vulva edema or marked tumor regression). \n• Planning should be taken with care to respect normal tissue tolerances such as rectum, bladder, small bowel, and femoral head and neck.6 \nGeneral Treatment Information\n• Bolus should be used to ensure adequate dosing to superficial target volume both at the primary site and when LNs are just below the skin \nsurface.\n• TLD, optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD), or electronic dosimetry to skin may be used for dose verification.\nVULVA-D  \n3 OF 5Continued\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

Breaks from treatment should be minimized. Adequate dosing is crucial \nand can be accomplished with either 3D conformal RT (3D-CRT) approaches or IMRT as long as care is given to assure adequate dosing and \ncoverage of tissues at risk for tumor involvement.1,7 IMRT is preferred over 3D-CRT to reduce dose to normal tissues and to allow for dose \nescalation.\n• Doses range from 45–50.4 Gy in 25–28 fractions (1.8 Gy fractions) for adjuvant therapy to 59.4–64.8 Gy in 33–36 total fractions (1.8 Gy \nfractions) for unresectable disease. In select cases, bulky/persistent primary disease or large nodes that are unresectable may be boosted to \n70 Gy.\n• High recurrence rates have been noted with 50 Gy alone for >2 mm of nodal involvement, or ECE; dose escalation to 54–60 Gy and/or \nconcurrent systemic therapy, preferably on the GROINS-V III protocol, can be considered.8\n• Suggested dosing to areas of risk: \n\u0017Gross primary vulva disease = 60–70 Gy\n\u0017Primary surgical bed (postoperative, negative margins) = 45–50 Gy\n\u0017Primary surgical bed (postoperative close or positive margins) = 54–60 Gy\n\u0017Clinically and/or radiographically uninvolved inguinofemoral LNs = 45–50 Gy\n\u0017Inguinofemoral LNs (positive, no ECE or gross residual disease) = 50–55 Gy\n\u0017Inguinofemoral LNs (ECE) = 54–64 Gy\n\u0017LNs (gross residual or unresectable disease) = 60–70 Gy\nVULVA-D \n4 OF 5ReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

These treatments \ncause acute, short-term, and long-term toxicities.  \n• Surgical approaches may be extensive and pose risks such as adhesion formation, which may cause pain and may contribute to small \nbowel obstruction, urinary or gastrointestinal complications (eg, incontinence, diarrhea), pelvic floor dysfunction (manifested by a variety of \nurinary, bowel, and/or sexual effects), and lymphedema.  \n• Chemotherapy agents vary, although commonly used regimens may pose a significant risk of neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, development of \nhematologic cancers, and cognitive dysfunction. \n• Long-term estrogen deprivation may cause symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and bone loss.  \n• RT may cause long-term complications (eg, fibrosis, vulvovaginal atrophy) and may predispose patients to secondary cancers of the \nsubcutaneous tissue, and/or underlying organs that are proximal to the radiation field.  \n• Prior pelvic RT may contribute to bone loss and increase the risk of pelvic fractures. Consider bone density testing and prophylactic use of \nbisphosphonates, particularly in patients with osteoporosis.\n• Immunotherapy use is emerging, and to date, long-term effects of these treatments are unknown. \nAdditional Guidance  \n• NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management\n• NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation\n• NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship\nVULVA-FPsychosocial Effects \n• Psychosocial effects after cancer may be psychological (eg, depression, anxiety , fear of recurrence, altered body image), financial (eg, return \nto work, insurance concerns), and/or interpersonal (eg, relationships, sexuality, intimacy) in nature.  \nClinical Approach\n• All gynecologic cancer survivors should receive regular general medical care that focuses on managing chronic disease, monitoring \ncardiovascular risk factors, providing recommended vaccinations, and encouraging adoption of a healthy lifestyle.\n• In order to assess the late and long-term effects of gynecologic cancers, clinicians should comprehensively document the patient’ s history, \nconduct a thorough physical examination, and provide any necessary imaging and/or laboratory testing. All patients, whether sexually \nactive or not, should be asked about genitourinary symptoms, including vulvovaginal dryness. Referral to appropriate specialty providers \n(eg, physical therapy, pelvic floor therapy, sexual therapy, psychotherapy) is recommended. As most treatments for gynecologic cancers \nwill cause sexual dysfunction, early menopause, and infertility, special attention to the resultant medical and psychosocial implications is \nneeded.  \n• Post-radiation use of vaginal dilators and moisturizers is recommended.\n• For treatment-related menopause, hormone therapy should be considered.\n• Communication and coordination with all clinicians involved in the care of survivors, including primary care clinicians, is critical. Providing \ncancer survivors with a summary of their treatment and recommendations for follow-up is recommended.

During the initial MRI simulation, water-\nsoluble intravaginal gel can be very helpful at more specifically delineating the degree of mucosal involvement. \n• Contouring guidelines are not available for vaginal melanoma; however, for vulvar cancer can be adapted to include inguinal coverage when \nthere is involvement of the distal half,3 and vaginal cancer/recurrence guidelines can be adapted for brachytherapy planning.6,7\n• Definitive Therapy (Unresectable or recurrent disease, treated with primary RT)\n\u0017PTV high risk (primary tumor plus involved regional nodes) should receive a goal EQD2 dose of 70–90 Gy, respecting normal tissue \ntolerance.  Lower dose ranges (70–80 Gy) are used for distal disease due to higher radiation sensitivity of the distal vagina. Higher dose \nranges (80–90 Gy) are used for apical/proximal diseases. \n\u0017PTV low/intermediate risk (regions suspected to have subclinical disease) should receive a goal EQD2 dose of 44–55 Gy.\n\u0017In non-melanoma vaginal cancers, brachytherapy with either interstitial or intracavitary techniques is the preferred approach to escalate \ndose to the gross vaginal disease and can similarly be used in vaginal melanoma when surgical resection is deemed too morbid, though \ndata are limited.\n\u0017For definitive therapy dosing regimens, see VM-A (3 of 7).\n ◊For OAR Constraints for Cumulative EBRT + Brachytherapy dosing, see VM-A (4 of 7).\n• Adjuvant Therapy (Postoperative RT)\n\u0017May be considered for close or positive margins where re-resection may be too morbid.\n\u0017Interval from surgery to RT is ideally <6 weeks unless adjuvant systemic therapy is given first, or for delayed wound healing.\n\u0017Elective nodal radiation may be considered for any LN >3 cm, ENE, or ≥3 positive nodes.8\n\u0017For adjuvant therapy dosing regimens, see VM-A (5 of 7).PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-2 Overview \nIn 2023 , an estimated 6470 individuals  will be diag nosed with vulvar \ncancer, and 1670 deaths  are expected from the disease.1 Vulvar cancer \naccounts for 5 % to 8% of gynecologic malignancies and median age of \ndiagnosis is 68 years. Based on data from the SEER database, 5 -year \nsurvival rates range from 85.6 % for localized disease (stages I/II), to \n47.5% for regional or locally advanced disease (stages III/IVA), and finally \nto 23.3% for patients with stage IVB (which includes patients with pelvic \nnodal disease).2 Studies of the SEER database and the National Cancer \nDatabase (NCDB) have shown that treatment approaches/modalities vary \nconsiderably with sociodemographic factors such as race/ethnicity, age, \nand non- private insurance, particularly for individuals with advanced \ndisease.3,4  \nNinety percent of vulvar cancers are of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) \nhistology .5 Risk factors for the development of vulvar neoplasia include \nincreasing age, infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), cigarette \nsmoking, inflammatory conditions affecting the vulva, and \nimmunodeficiency. Most vulvar neoplasias are diagnosed at early stages.6 \nRarer histologies exist and include melanoma, extramammary Paget’s \ndisease, Bartholin gland adenocarcinoma, verrucous carcinoma, basal cell \ncarcinoma, and sarcoma.7  \nThe International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease ( ISVVD) \nhas revised the terminology used to characterize vulvar lesions over the  \nyears. In 2004, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) terminology was refined to include two types of lesions, usual -type VIN and differentiated \nVIN (dVIN) .\n8 Usual -type VIN was linked to persistent infection with \ncarcinogenic strains of HPV, while d VIN was commonly associated with \nvulvar dermatologic conditions such as lichen sclerosus. In 2015, the \nISVVD updated the description to three classes of vulvar lesions: 1) low -\ngrade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) due to flat condyloma or HPV effect; 2) high- grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL, formerly \nconsidered usual -type VIN); and 3) d VIN.9 The 2020 WHO Classification \nof Female Genital Tumors, VIN is now classified as HPV -associated or \nHPV-independent. HPV -associated VIN corresponds to low - and high-\ngrade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( SIL) similar to other anatomic sites \nin the anogenital tract .10 HPV-independent VIN is associated with  a faster \nrate of progression to invasive SCC. It is the less common form of VIN and \nis often associated with lichen sclerosus.  \nThe histologic  grade of SCC is not well -defined and can be subjective. \nHPV-associated SCC has  a better prognosis than HPV -independent SCC. \nHPV-associated SCC frequently occurs in younger patients, is multifocal, \nis associated with classic VIN, and can be seen in conjunction with \nadditional sites of lower genital tract squamous neoplasia. \nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) shows strong, diffuse, block -like positive \nnuclear and cytoplasmic staining with p16 and wild- type p53 \n(heterogeneous staining pattern). HPV-independent SCC is split into two \nmain groups: those associated with TP53  mutations and those with wild-\ntype TP53  status.11 The p53 abnormal, HPV -independent SCC usually \noccurs in older patients, is unifocal, and is associated with dVIN  by \nhistological evaluation. IHC usually shows aberrant p53 staining and \nnegative or weak  p16 staining. The p53 abnormal SCCs have the worst \nclinical outcomes of the three molecular categories (HPV positive, HPV -\nnegative/p53 mutant, and HPV -negative p53 wild type). Assessing the \npresence and depth of invasion in vulvar SCC can be challenging.  \nEstimates of the percentage of vulvar cancers attributable to HPV infection \nrange from conservative estimates of 30% to up to 69%, with a meta -\nanalysis reporting an HPV prevalence of 39.7%.12-15 A recent meta -\nanalysis showed the prevalence of HPV in vulvar cancer and VIN to be 39.1% and 76.1%, respectively . Of the HPV -positive disease, 78.1% were \nHPV-16, followed by HPV -33 in vulvar cancer.

The prevalence of p16- positive vulvar cancer was 34.1% \nwhile it was 65.7% in VIN.16 However, HPV infection is detected in 80% to \n90% of  patients with SIL. Historically, VIN has been diagnosed in younger \npatients  (median age 45 –50 years) while vulvar cancers have been \ndiagnosed in older patients  (median age 65–70 years).17,18 Because a \nlarge majority of HPV -related vulvar cancers are associated with HPV- 16 \nand HPV -18 strains, vaccination with currently available HPV vaccines \nmay reduce the burden of HPV- related vulvar cancers in the future.12,17  \nBy definition, the NCCN Guidelines cannot incorporate all possible clinical \nvariations and are not intended to replace good clinical judgment or \nindividualization of treatments. “Many exceptions to the rule” were \ndiscussed among the members of the p anel during the process of \ndeveloping these guidelines. Recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines are category 2A unless otherwise noted. \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org .  \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology ( NCCN Guidelines\n®) for Vulvar Cancer  an electronic search of \nthe PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature  in vulvar \ncancer  published since the previous Guidelines update, using the following \nsearch terms: vulvar cancer or carcinoma of the vulva.  The PubMed \ndatabase was chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for \nmedical literature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.  \nThe search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial,  Phase II; Clinical Trial,  Phase III; Clinical Trial,  Phase IV; Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta- Analysis; Systematic \nReviews; and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines as discussed by the p anel \nduring the Guidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high- level evidence is \nlacking are based on the panel ’s review of lower -level evidence and expert \nopinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation.  NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the inform ation is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-4 Diagnosis and Workup \nThese guidelines utilize the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology \nand Obstetrics)  staging system  for carcinoma of the vulva which was \nupdated in 202119 from the 2009 system. 20-23 The updated FIGO system  \nhas included a revised definition for depth of invasion, lymph node (LN) \nmetastases definition, and allows the incorporation of  findings from cross -\nsectional imaging.   \nThe presentation of vulvar cancer can be widely varied. The majority of \nvulvar cancers are located in the labia majora. Other possible sites include \nthe labia minora, clitoris, mons  pubis , or perineum. In patients with HPV -\nnegative tumors, vulvar cancer often presents as a single mass or ulcer on the labia majora or minora. In HPV -positive tumors, multifocal lesions and \nconcurrent cervical neoplasia are more common.\n17,18,24 Although many \ncases may be asymptomatic, pruritus and pain/irritation are common \nsymptoms ; vulvar bleeding or discharge may also occur. A majority of \npatients present with early -stage localized disease.2 \nDiagnosis is made through biopsy of all suspicious areas followed by \npathologic review. The College of American Pathologists (CAP) protocol \nfor vulvar  carcinoma is a useful guide \n(https://documents.cap.org/protocols/Vulva_4.2.0.2.REL_CAPCP.pdf ). \nThis CAP protocol was revised in 2021.   \nWorkup includes history and physical examination, complete blood count \n(CBC) , and liver and renal function tests. In addition to vulva examination, \nevaluation of the vagina and cervix  (including cytologic smears ) should be \nemphasized due to the multifocal nature of squamous cell intraepithelial \nneoplasia. CT, PET/CT, and MRI may be used to delineate the extent of \ntumor and/or for treatment planning.25-28 Examination-u nder-anesthesia \n(EUA) cystoscopy or proctoscopy should be considered as indicated . \nAppropriate patients should receive smoking cessation counseling, cervical HPV testing , and cytology testing. Consider HIV testing, especially \nin younger patients.  Those with vulvar cancer and HIV should be referred \nto an HIV specialist; modifications to the recommended cancer treatments in these Guidelines should not be modified solely on the basis of HIV \nstatus. For patients with vulvar cancer  who are ≥ 65 year s, also see the \nNCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology  at www.NCCN.org\n.  \nPrognostic Factors  \nHistorically, en bloc vulvectomy with wide margins was combined with \ncomplete inguinofemoral ( IF) lymphadenectomy to treat vulvar SCC. While \neffective in promoting survival, this approach was associated with serious short - and long- term morbidity ( eg, wound complications, lymphedema, \ndecreased sexual function, adverse impacts on body image). The emergence of data on important prognostic factors in vulvar cancer \ninformed the evolution of surgical staging and primary treatment.\n24 Based \non a retrospective review of 586 patients enrolled in Gynecologic \nOncology Group (GOG) trials through 1984, independent predictors of \nsurvival included the presence and number of involved LNs  and primary \ntumor size.29 LN metastasis is considered the most important prognostic \nfactor and determinant of treatment in vulvar cancer,30,31 and extracapsular \nextension has been linked to poorer prognosis.32-35 Factors that may be \npredictive of recurrence and/or survival include depth of invasion, \npathologic margin distance, tumor thickness, and presence of \nlymphovascular space invasion (LVSI).17,29,36-41 However, these findings are \nprimarily derived from retrospective analyses. A systematic review of the \ncollective data on prognostic factors for local recurrence in vulvar cancer \nconcluded that the weight of each individual prognostic variable remained \nequivocal when compared to one another.42 \nPrognostic data have guided the shift towards more conservative primary tumor resection and regional LN management for early -stage disease.\n43 \nThe preferred surgical approach evolved towards vulvar -sparing PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-5 techniques with separate incisions for lymphadenectomy  in patients who \nwere clinically node negative.24,44 Current surgical approaches involve \ntailored primary tumor resection and LN  evaluation based on individual \npatient characteristics.45,46 Data suggest that survival is not negatively \nimpacted by less radical surgical approaches for early -stage cancers.46 \nSurgical Staging  \nPreviously, t he AJCC and the 2009 FIGO systems staged  vulvar cancer \naccording to extent of primary tumor (T), LN  status (N), and distant \nmetastasis (M). Clinical staging alone provides inadequate evaluation of \nLN involvement. Because LN metastasis is a key  prognostic factor  in \nvulvar cancer survival ,30,46 these systems used  a hybrid surgical and \nclinical/pathologic approach for more accurate evaluation of nodal status. \nComplete staging using the existing system requi res primary tumor \nresection and full IF lymphadenectomy. However, common practice has \nincreasingly included the use of sentinel LN  (SLN) biopsy in lieu of \ncomplete lymphadenectomy , as well as diagnostic imaging to determine \nextent of disease.47,48 In the new 2021 staging system, the revisions have \nbeen made to allow imaging to be used to assign stage. For stage 1 \ndisease, the new method for measurement of depth of invasion has been \nadded,  which is now measured from the basement membrane of the \ndeepest, adjacent, dysplastic, tumor -free rete ridge (or nearest dysplastic \nrete peg) to the deepest point of invasion. Stage IIIA now also includes the \nupper two-thirds of the urethra, upper two-thirds of the  vagina, and bladder \nmucosa or rectal mucosa,  which  were previously part of stage IVA. S tage \nIIIA includes any number of LNs  less than or equal to 5 mm and no longer \nincludes LN metastasis in a single node greater than 5 mm ; this is now \nconsidered stage IIIB. Stage IVA includes disease fixed to pelvic bone or \nfixed or ulcerated regional LN metastases , and stage IVB includes any \ndistant metastases.19 Pathologic Evaluation  \nSurgicopathologic factors may be used to guide the extent of surgical \nstaging and treatment decisions. Findings from pathologic assessment of \nthe surgical specimen should be carefully documented, including \nprocedure type ( ie, partial  or total vulvectomy)  and depth of procedure ( ie, \nsuperficial or skinning, simple, or radical) . Important elements of primary \ntumor evaluation include tumor site; size  (in multiple dimensions);  number \nof tumor foci;  histologic type and grade; depth of stromal invasion; surgical \nmargin status; and the presence of LVSI . When resected, the number of \nLNs with isolated tumor cells, micrometastases, and macrometastases \nshould be recorded. If SLN mapping is performed, SLNs should undergo \nultrastaging for detection of low -volume metastasis. Other important \nfactors include tumor involvement of tissues/organs such as the vagina, \nurethra, anus, bladder mucosa, rectal mucosa, and pelvic bone. Mismatch \nrepair (MMR), microsatellite instability (MSI),  programmed death ligand 1 \n(PD-L1), neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase ( NTRK ) gene fusion, and \ntumor mutational burden (TMB) testing may also be considered for \ntreatment planning purposes  in patients with recurrent, progressive, or \nmetastatic disease.  Additional testing to determine HPV status is \nrecommended. Various methods can be used to detect HPV including \ndetection of overexpressed p16 via IHC, and HPV -specific polymerase \nchain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques ( for viral \nmRNA and DNA  detection ). The NCCN Guidelines recommend p53 IHC to \ndetermine p53 status.  Evaluation of p53 IHC in vulvar SCC may be \nchallenging and has unique features compared to p53 staining patterns \nencountered in ovarian and endometrial cancers.49 \nPrimary Tumor Resection  \nDepending on the size and extent of the primary tumor, simple partial /total  \nvulvectomy  or radical  partial /total  vulvectomy may be required. No \nprospective data are available to compare outcomes between these \nresection techniques; however, retrospective data suggest no difference in PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-6 recurrence and/or survival.50-52 Both surgical approaches involve resection \nof approximately a 1 - to 2-cm radial margin of grossly normal tissue and to \nthe deep fascia or a minimum of a 1-cm deep margin.  \n \nVulvar cancer is associated with significant risk of local recurrence, and \ndata demonstrate tumor margin status to be a significant prognostic \nfactor.36,39,53 A review identified 4- year recurrence -free rates of 82%, 63% , \nand 37% for patients  with negative, close , and positive margins, \nrespectively ( P = .005) . The highest risk of recurrence was associated with \nmargins less than or equal to 5 mm.54 The goal of primary tumor resection \nis complete removal with negative pathologic margins.  The definition of a \nnegative margin continues to evolve,  and more data confirm the \nimportance of a negative margin but  put less emphasis on the actual \ndistance (in mm) of the margin.  In the setting of close or positive tumor \nmargins, re -resection to obtain negative  margins or adjuvant local \nradiation therapy (RT) are options.36,55 In a study, tumor -free margins of at \nleast 2 mm were associated with lower local recurrence risk.40  \nThe risk -benefit ratio and morbidity of each approach must be weighed \nand individualized for  each patient. Evidence supports improved \nrecurrence rates and survival with re -resection or adjuvant external beam \nRT (EBRT) to the primary site.56 However, for close or positive margins \ninvolving the urethra, anus, or vagina, re- resection may incur significant \nmorbidity and negatively impact patient quality of life. Re -resection may \nalso be inappropriate for patients with close or positive margins w ho have \ninguinal node involvement requiring adjuvant treatment with EBRT ±  \nconcurrent chemotherapy.  \nLymph Node Evaluation  \nBecause LN status is the most important determinant of survival in vulvar \ncancer, careful evaluation and determination of nodal status is paramount. \nLN resection is performed through a separate incision from the primary tumor and may entail ipsilateral or bilateral IF lymphadenectomy, or SLN \nbiopsy in select cases. IF lymphadenectomy involves removal of \nsuperficial inguinal and deep femoral LN . Further emphasizing the \nimportance of adequate IF lymph node (IFLN) evaluation and treatment at \ninitial presentati on, it has been widely reported that subsequent groin \nrelapses are rarely amenable to successful secondary treatment.  \nLymphadenectomy  in patients with clinically negative groin nodes is \ninformed by the size and location of the primary tumor. Because the risk of \nLN metastasis is less than 1% in patients wi th stage IA primary  disease,45 \nlymphadenectomy or SLN evaluation can be omitted in patients with stage \nIA primary disease with clinically negative groins. However, IF \nlymphadenectomy is recommended for patients with stage IB/II disease because the risk of nodal metastasis is estimated at greater than 8% for \nstage IB and even higher for stage II tumors.\n45 For primary vulvar tumors \nless than 4 cm in diameter, located at least 2 cm from the vulvar midline, \nwith clinically negative IFLNs, ipsilateral IF lymphadenectomy or SLN \nbiopsy are appropriate.57,58 However, bilateral LN evaluation ( IF \nlymphadenectomy or SLN biopsy, if indicated) is recommended for \npatients with primary tumors that are within 2 cm of, or crossing, the vulvar \nmidline.58 Lymphadenectomy for stage III/IV disease is individualized, and \nintegrated with combined modality approaches.    \nSLN Biopsy  \nReported rates of postoperative morbidity with unilateral or bilateral IF \nlymphadenectomy are high. An estimated 20% to 40% of patients have \nwound complications and 30% to 70% of patients experience  \nlymphedema.59-61 Studies have begun to investigate whether complete IF \nlymphadenectomy could be safely avoided in patients who are determined to have a negative SLN. Several prospective multicenter trials have \nevaluated the feasibility, safety, validity, and risk of groin recurrences with \nSLN biopsy in early vulvar cancer.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-7 The safety and accuracy of SLN assessment was examined in a \nmulticenter observational study (GROINSS -V I) of 403 females  with \nprimary vulvar tumors less than 4 cm. IF lymphadenectomy was omitted if \nSLN(s) were negative on ultrastaging. With a median follow -up period of \n35 months (24- month minimum), groin recurrences were detected among \n6 of 259 patients (2.3%) with a unifocal primary tumor and negative SLN. \nThe 3- year survival rate was 97%, leading to the conclusion that a \nnegative SLN  in this patient population provided sufficient management  of \nthe groin(s). Short - and long- term morbidity was reduced if the SLN only \nwas removed compared with SLN removal followed by full groin lymphadenectomy .\n62  \nIn GOG 173, 452 females  (with vulva -confined primary tumors 2– 6 cm, at \nleast 1- mm invasion, and clinically node negative) underwent SLN \nmapping and biopsy followed by IF lymphadenectomy. SLNs were \nidentified in 418 females , and 132 females  were node positive (including \n11 false- negative nodes). SLN biopsy had a sensitivity of 91.7%, negative \npredictive value of 96.3%, and false- negative predictive value of 3.7% \noverall (2% for primary tumors <4 cm).63  \nA subgroup analysis of the AGO -CaaRE -1 study compared outcomes of \npatients with tumors less than 4 cm who underwent radical  groin \nlymphadenectomy  or sentinel node lymphadenectomy with negative \nfindings for LN/SLN metastasis (n = 556). The radical groin \nlymphadenectomy cohort had larger tumor diameter (20 mm vs. 13 mm; P  \n< .001) and greater depth of invasion (4.0 mm vs. 3.0 mm; P  = .002), but \nisolated groin recurrence rates did not differ between the groups. \nMultivariate analysis controlling for tumor charac teristics such as diameter, \ndepth of invasion, grade, and LVSI revealed no statistical differences in progression- free survival ( PFS)  and overall survival ( OS) between the \nradical and sentinel node lymphadenectomy cohorts.\n64   A systematic review and meta -analysis of the cumulative data on SLN \nbiopsy revealed a per -groin detection rate of 87% when using dual tracers, \nand a false- negative rate of 6.4%. When comparing IF lymphadenectomy, \nsuperficial IF lymphadenectomy, and SLN biopsy, recurrences rates were \n1.4%, 6.6%, and 3.4% in patients deemed node -negative by the surgical \ngroin approach used, respectively.65 \nThe GROINSS -V I observational study also evaluated patients with \npositive SLNs. Within the 135 of 403 patients who had positive SLNs \n(33%), investigators examined the relationship between size of SLN  \nmetastasis and risk of  non-sentinel node disease among 115 patients who \nunderwent IF lymphadenectomy following detection of positive sentinel \nnodes. Risk of non- SLN involvement increased steadily with the size of \nSLN metastasis, beginning at 4.2%  with detection of isolated tumor cells \nand increasing to 62.5% wi th SLN metastases greater than 10 mm, \nsuggesting no disease threshold below which further treatment of an  SLN-\npositive groin could be safely omitted. Disease -specific survival (DSS) was \nworse among those with SLN metastases greater than 2 mm versus less \nthan or equal to 2 mm (69.5% vs. 94.4%, P  = .001).66 Patients undergoing \nSLN biopsy reported less treatment -related morbidity compared with those \nundergoing IF  lymphadenectomy .67 \nLong- term follow- up of the GROINSS -V I cohort compared outcomes of \nSLN-positive patients who underwent completion IF lymphadenectomy  \nwith those of SLN -negative patients (no IF lymphadenectomy ). At a \nmedian follow -up of 105 months, the data revealed a 5 - and 10- year local \nvulvar recurrence rate of 24.6% and 36.4% for SLN -negative patients, and \n33.2% and 46.4% for SLN -positive patients ( P = .03). The isolated  groin \nrecurrence rate was 2.5% for S LN-negative patients and 8.0% for S LN-\npositive patients at 5 year s, despite more radical treatment in the latter \ngroup.

Among 322 patients with metastatic SLN, 160 had \nmicrometastases  (≤2 mm) and 162 patients had macrometastases  (>2 \nmm). Among  160 patients with S LN micrometastases, 126 received IF \nradiotherapy, with an ipsilateral isolated groin recurrence rate at 2 years of \n1.6%. In 162 patients with S LN macrometastases, the isolated groin \nrecurrence rate at 2 years was 22% in those who underwent radiotherapy, \nand 6.9% in those who underwent IFL ( P =.011). Treatment -related \nmorbidity after radiotherapy was less frequent  compared with IF \nlymphadenectomy . \nThe ongoing GROINSS-V III/NRG -GY024 phase 2 study is investigating \nthe feasibility and safety of replacing IF lymphadenectomy with chemoradiation in patients with early -stage vulvar cancer with a \nmacrometastasis and/or extracapsular extension in the sentinel node.\n70  \nPanel Recommendations  \nIn the current version of the Guidelines, the section on principles of \nsurgery has been updated to include management of mapping based on tumor location in reference to midline structures of the vulva. For  \nappropriate individuals, the panel considers SLN mapping and biopsy of \nthe IFLN  basin to be a reasonable alternative approach to decrease \npostoperative morbidity while maintaining a low rate of groin \nrecurrences.\n62,63,66  \nCandidates for SLN biopsy should have clinically/radiologically negative groin nodes, unifocal primary tumor less than 4 cm, and no history of previous vulvar surgery.\n65,66 Mapping and biopsy should be performed by a \nhigh- volume SLN surgeon using dual tracers ( ie, radiocolloid and dye) to \nensure the best detection rates.63,65 The panel recommends complete IF \nlymphadenectomy if no ipsilateral SLN is detected. If the ipsilateral SLN is \npositive, completion lymphadenectomy or treatment of the affected groin is \nwarranted. The contralateral groin should be evaluated surgically and/or \ntreated with EBRT. In select cases of a single, small -volume, unilateral, \npositive inguinal node with a well -lateralized small primary tumor and \ndepth of invasion less than or equal to 5 mm and with a clinically negative \ncontralateral groin examination,  a contralateral groin lymphadenectomy  or \nradiation may be omitted.71 \nPrimary Treatment  \nFor the purposes of primary treatment, these guidelines provide \nrecommendations by clinical stage, separating patients into those with \nearly -stage (stage I ; select  stage II tumors ), locally advanced \n(unresectable without removing proximal urethra/bladder/anus), and \ndistant metastatic disease beyond the pelvis .  \nEarly -Stage Disease  \nAfter careful clinical evaluation and staging, the standard primary \ntreatment of early -stage vulvar cancer  is conservative, individualized \ntumor excision with IFLN evaluation.44,51,72-75 Clinicians should strive for \nprimary tumor resection with oncologically appropriate margins of 1 to 2 cm if feasible.\n36,39,53,55 See Primary Tumor Resection and Lymph Node \nEvaluation in this discussion. Although there are no prospective data \ncomparing radical local incision to radical vulvectomy, existing data from retrospective analyses do not demonstrate a difference in recurrence or \nsurvival outcomes.\n51,52  \n Surgical dissection and RT have been evaluated for treatment of the groin \nin early -stage disease.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-9 results in less morbidity than surgical dissection.76 However, surgical \ntreatment of the groin (followed by tailored adjuvant RT if LN -positive) has \nbeen associated with lower groin recurrence rates and remains the \npreferred approach.77 Primary radiation may have some benefit for those \nunable to undergo surgery.78,79  \nPanel Recommendations  \nFor stage I tumors with less than or equal to 1 mm depth of invasion, the \npanel recommends simple partial vulvectomy ; IFLN evaluation is not \nrequired due to the low risk of LN  metastasis in these patients.45,73,80- 83 \nPatients should be observed following resection. If surgical pathology \nreveals greater than 1 -mm invasion, additional surgery may be indicated.  \n \nIn treatment for patients with stage I B (>1-mm invasion)  or select stage II  \ntumors, primary treatment is dictated by tumor location. Patients with lateralized lesions located greater than or equal to 2 cm from the vulvar \nmidline should undergo radical partial vulvectomy accompanied by \nipsilateral  IFLN evaluation.\n57,58,80 IF node evaluation can be performed \nthrough SLN biopsy or ipsilateral IF  lymphadenectomy; the latter  should \nbe performed if no SLN(s) is/are detected. Adjuvant therapy is informed by primary tumor risk factors and nodal surgical pathology. Patients with \nanterior or posterior central vulvar lesions should undergo radical partial  \nvulvectomy accompanied by bilateral IF node evaluation consisting of SLN \nbiopsy or b ilateral IF  lymphadenectomy .\n51,58,80 IF lymphadenectomy  is \nrequired on side(s) for which sentinel nodes are not detected. Adjuvant \ntherapy is informed by primary tumor  risk factors and nodal surgical \npathology.  For lateralized and near midline tumors with unilateral SLN \nmetastasis, unilateral groin treatment by either IF lymphadenectomy or RT \nis acceptable. For midline tumors with unilateral SLN metastasis, unilateral groin treatment can be performed if the contr alateral groin has negative \nsentinel node or negative IF lymphadenectomy.\n58,84 Locally Advanced Disease  \nHistorically, locally advanced vulvar cancers were treated  primarily with \nradical surger ies such as en bloc radical vulvectomy with bilateral IF \nlymphadenectomy or pelvic exenteration. These surgeries resulted in \nsome cures, but also led to significant postoperative complications, loss of \nfunction, and reduced quality of life.24,85- 87 Additionally, complete resection \nof locally advanced disease may be complicated by tumor fixed to vital \norgans or vessels, rendering the disease unresectable.88 A shift to \nmultimodality treatment was explored to improve organ preservation and \nreduce surgical treatment morbidity.89 Preoperative RT was shown in \nsome earlier studies to result in tumor debulking and reduce the extent of surgery required for locally advanced disease.\n88,90- 93 Subsequently, \nborrowing on experience from advanced cervical and anal cancers, \nchemotherapy typically has been added as a “radiosensitizer” when \nradiation is delivered in patients with advanced disease.  \nChemoradiation  \nResearch directly comparing treatment approaches for locally advanced \nvulvar cancers is limited. Data from small patient cohorts have shown a \ngenerally high response rate to chemoradiation among most patients with \nstage III/IVA disease, as well as the feas ibility of resection for residual \ndisease following chemoradiation. Following chemoradiation, at least \npartial tumor responses were noted among a wide majority of the patients \nin these cohorts,94-98 with several studies revealing complete tumor \nresponses among more than 60% of the cohort.99-103  \nPrimary chemoradiation may confer a survival benefit over primary RT in \nvulvar cancer. OS after primary chemoradiation was superior to OS \nfollowing primary RT in a series of 54 patients with locally advanced \ndisease.104 A similar survival benefit was reported in a study using NCDB \ndata from patients who were not candidates for surgery, comparing \ncohorts who received primary chemoradiation (n = 999) or primary RT (n = PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

The chemoradiation cohort was younger with more advanced \ndisease based on FIGO staging. Chemoradiation was associated with \nsignificantly higher 5 -year OS than primary RT ( 49.9% vs. 27.4%, P  \n<0.001)  and multivariate analysis revealed a reduced hazard of death \n(hazard ratio [ HR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63 –0.91; P = .003) .105 \nIn the GOG 101 study, preoperative chemoradiation was examined in 73 \npatients with stage III/IV disease.96 The study investigated whether \nchemoradiation allowed for less radical surgery in patients with T3 tumors and avoidance of pelvic exenteration in patients with T4 tumors. Only 3% \nof patients (2/71) had residual unresectable disease following \nchemoradiation, and preservation of urinary and/or gastrointestinal (GI) \ncontinence was possible in 96% of patients (68/71).  \nTwo prospective studies from the GOG more closely examined the benefits of surgery after chemoradiation for patients with locally advanced \ndisease. GOG 101 examined 46 patients with vulvar SCC and N2/N3 \nnodal involvement.\n106 Subsequent surgery was performed on 38 patients \nwith resectable disease after chemoradiation with cisplatin/5- fluorouracil \n(5-FU). Local control of nodal disease was achieved in 36 of 37 patients \nand for the primary tumor in 29  of 38 patients. T he GOG 205 study \nexamined the feasibility of surgery after chemoradiation with cisplatin in 58 \npatients with T3/T4 tumors that  were initially unresectable by radical \nvulvectomy.107 Complete clinical response was noted in 64% of patients \n(37 of 58), with pathologic complete response  (pCR)  in 78% (29 of 34) of \npatients undergoing surgical biopsy.  Of the total population, approximately \n50% achieved pCR after chemoradiation therapy.  The high pCR rates \nhave led many to believe that surgery can be avoided in patients with \nlocally advanced tumors who achieve clinical complete responses.  \nA phase II, multicenter, prospective trial evaluated treatment feasibility, \npercentage  of locoregional control, survival , and toxicity after locoregional \nradiotherapy combined with sensitizing chemotherapy with capecitabine in 52 patients with T2/T3 tumors .108 Of the total patients , 58% had no \nevidence of disease at a median of 35 months. PFS was 58%, 51%, and \n45%, and OS was 76%, 66%, and 52% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively.  \nMost  acute toxicity greater than or equal to grade 3 reported were related \nto skin/mucosa (54%) and pain (37%). Late toxicity greater than or equal \nto grade 3 was reported for s kin/mucosa (10%), fibrosis (4%), GI \nincontinence (4%) and stress fracture or osteoradionecrosis (4%).  \nAn analysis of NCDB data (2004– 2012) compared outcomes of 2046 \nfemales  with locally advanced vulvar cancer who received primary \nradiation (RT or chemoradiation), or preoperative radiation (RT or \nchemoradiation) followed by surgery. Patients who underwent surgery \nafter RT/chemoradiation had longer OS than patients who underwent \nprimary RT/chemoradiation without subs equent resection (57.1%  vs. \n41.7%  at 3 years, respectively; P  < .001) . However, multivariate analysis \nrevealed a radiation dose- dependent effect,  and survival was not \nsignificantly worse if the dose exceeded 55 Gy. With sufficient RT dose and concurrent chemotherapy, the primary RT cohort had comparable \nsurvival to the group who underwent lower -dose preoperative \nRT/chemoradiation followed by surger y.\n109 \nA 2011 Cochrane database review of the existing randomized controlled \ntrial data on 141 females  with locally advanced vulvar SCC revealed no \ndifference in OS when comparing primary surgery to primary or neoadjuvant chemoradiation.\n110 However, the data did not allow for broad \nconclusions to be drawn regarding treatment -related quality of life and \nadverse events. An earlier Cochrane database review of five non-\nrandomized trials suggested that patients with unresectable primary \ndisease and those requiring exenteration may benefit from  neoadjuvant  \nchemoradiation if disease was rendered resectable or requiring less radical surgery .\n111  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-11 The combination regimen used for radiosensitization was most commonly \ncisplatin/ fluorouracil ,96,97,99,101,102 but also included fluorouracil /mitomycin \nC295,98,103 or single- agent therapy.100,107 The selection of radiosensitizing \nchemotherapy is often based on extrapolation of findings from cervical, \nanal, or head and neck cancer.  \nPanel Recommendations  \nPatients with locally advanced tumors  (unresectable without removing \nproximal urethra/bladder/anus ) should undergo radiologic imaging to \nexamine potential nodal involvement. The panel recommends that all \npatients with locally advanced disease receive EBRT with concurrent chemotherapy. IF lymphadenectomy  may be used to assess nodal \nmetastasis and inform RT treatment planning.  \nIf IF lymphadenectomy  is not performed, or if positive IFLNs are found \nduring the procedure , EBRT coverage should include the primary tumor, \ngroin, and pelvi c nodes.  If no positive nodes are detected following IF \nlymphadenectomy, EBRT with concurrent chemotherapy should be \nprovided with RT coverage of the primary tumor, with or without selective \ncoverage of IFLNs. \nPatients with radiographically suspicious  nodes (including those with \npelvis -confined metastases) should be evaluated for IF  lymphadenectomy . \nIf IF lymphadenectomy  is not performed, fine -needle aspiration (FNA) of \nenlarged LNs can be considered. Patients should receive EBRT and \nconcurrent chemotherapy; EBRT coverage should include the primary \ntumor, IF nodes , and pelvi c nodes. Selective IFLN  RT coverage can be \nconsidered if lymphadenectomy reveals no positive LNs .  \nAgents recommended by the p anel for chemoradiation include cisplatin \n(preferred) and carboplatin if the patient is intolerant to cisplatin. The panel \nalso lists cisplatin/fluorouracil under “other recommended regimens .”\n112 In addition, if cisplatin or carboplatin are unavailable, the panel has \nincluded capecitabine/mitomycin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel as options \nthat may be considered under the “other recommended regimens” \ncategory.  These radiosensitizers were added based on a few early -phase \nstudies extrapolated from cervical cancer that have shown their efficacy and tolerability when administered concomitantly with radiation.\n113- 116    \nMetastasis Beyond the Pelvis  \nThe NCCN P anel recommends primary treatment options for extra -pelvic \nmetastatic disease including EBRT for control of locoregional disease and symptom palliation, and/or systemic therapy. Best supportive care is also \nan alternative in this setting. Data on systemic treatments for vulvar cancer  \nwith distant metastasis are extremely limited.\n117- 119 Treatment regimens are \noften extrapolated from agents that are active against advanced cervical cancer. See the section on Systemic Therapy for Recurrent/Metastatic \nDisease  in this discussion  for information about specific regimens .   \nAdjuvant Therapy  \nDue to the rarity of vulvar cancer, especially advanced disease, \nprospective randomized trials on adjuvant therapy are extremely limited. \nMuch of the common adjuvant treatment approaches have been drawn \nfrom studies describing heterogenous, often -individualized treatment \napproaches , or extrapolated from effective adjuvant therapies for cervical \nand anal cancers.  \nAdjuvant RT and Chemoradiation  \nAlthough it is commonly accepted that LN  involvement is a critical \nprognostic factor in vulvar cancer , the optimal patient selection criteria and \nadjuvant therapy regimens to address nodal disease continue to be determined.\n120 As previously emphasized, it is crucial to prevent \nmetachronous groin relapses, as these often prove refractory to secondary \nmanagement and are often ultimately fatal.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-12 Early randomized trial data on adjuvant RT were published from GOG 37, \nwhich enrolled 114 patients with IF node- positive vulvar cancer after \nradical vulvectomy and bilateral IF lymphadenectomy.121,122 Patients were \nrandomized to receive pelvic lymphadenectomy  or adjuvant RT to the \ngroin/pelvis. Two - and 6- year survival were superior in the adjuvant RT \ngroup, but the most significant survival benefits were observed among \npatients with greater than or equal to 2 positive IF nodes or those with \nfixed ulcerative IF nodes. Long- term follow -up (median = 74 months)  \nrevealed higher rates of disease- related death for the group receiving \npelvic node resection compared with pelvic/groin RT  (51% vs. 29%; HR, \n0.49;  P = .015) .122 \nA study using SEER -Medicare– linked data examined outcomes for 444 \nolder  patients (aged ≥66 years; median age 78) with node- positive vulvar \ncancer who underwent adjuvant RT. Compared to surgery alone, better disease outcomes were associated with adjuvant RT when the following \nmetrics were met: completion of at least 20 fractions, treatment duration of \nless than 8 weeks, and  less than 1  week of intra- treatment break. \nHowever, only half of the cohort that received RT met these treatment benchmarks.\n123 \nThere are conflicting data on the benefit of adjuvant RT in patients with a \nsingle positive LN. Some studies in patients with a single positive LN  have \nreported no benefit of adjuvant RT in this setting.124,125 However, \nexamination of SEER data from 208 patients with stage III, single node-positive vulvar SCC revealed significant improvements in 5 -year DSS with \nthe addition of adjuvant RT compared with those receiving no RT.\n126 The \nsurvival benefit was more pronounced among patients who underwent less extensive lymphadenectomy ( ≤12 nodes excised).  \nIn a case series of 157 patients, disease- free survival (DFS) at 2 years \nwas 88% in node- negative patients, but 60%, 43%, and 29% in patients \nwith 1, 2, and greater than 2 positive  nodes . The number of involved nodes negatively impacted prognosis in patients receiving no adjuvant RT, but among patients receiving adjuvant RT to the groin/pelvis, the number \nof metastatic nodes did not harm prognosis.\n127  \nThe large, multicenter, retrospective AGO -CaRE -1 study reported \nsignificant survival benefits in node -positive patients receiving adjuvant RT \nor chemoradiation (3 -year PFS of 39.6% vs . 25.9% , P = .004; 3-year OS \nof 57.7% vs. 51.4% , P = .17 ).125 RT coverage most commonly included the \ngroin and pelvis ± coverage of the vulva, with a  smaller subset receiv ing \ncoverage to the groin ± vulvar coverage. Again, the benefits of adjuvant \nRT were most clear for patients with greater than or equal to 2 positive \nLNs.  \nAn examination of data from the NCDB  supported the addition of \nchemotherapy to RT in the adjuvant setting. Among 1797 patients with node- positive vulvar cancer, 26.3% received adjuvant chemotherapy in \naddition to RT after primary surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy increased \nsurvival time and reduced mortality risk (44 months vs . 29.7 months; HR , \n0.62;  95% CI , 0.48–0.79; P < .001).\n128 Based on SEER data, outcomes of \nadjuvant RT were  examined in 519 patients aged ≥ 66 years who received \nprimary surgery for node -positive vulvar cancer. Adjuvant RT was \nassociated with improved OS over surgery alone in this cohort of older \nfemales  (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57 –0.88;  P = .002) along with a trend \ntowards improved cause -specific survival  (CSS)  (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.59–\n1.05;  P = .11).129 Parameters for delivery of RT were important among this \ncohort ; 3-year OS and CSS were significantly improved in patients who \nreceived greater than or equal to 20 fractions (3 -year OS: 34% vs . 26%,  P \n= .008; 3- year CSS: 48% vs . 37%,  P = .03).   \nResearch has also examined the role of adjuvant RT to the primary tumor \nsite. Studies have indicated that isolated primary site recurrences may be \naddressed effectively by subsequent surgery, or that late recurrences may \nactually represent secondary tumors .

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-13 vulva in patients with close/positive surgical margins has also been \ninvestigated.130 Among patients with close/positive surgical margins at the \nprimary site, 5 -year OS was significantly improved by the addition of \nadjuvant RT to the primary site (67.6% vs. 29%; HR,  0.36; P = .038). \nPatients receiving adjuvant RT for close/positive margins had a similar 5 -\nyear OS to those with negative margins. A retrospective study examined the association of RT dose with vulvar recurrence, revealing lower risk of \nrecurrence in patients receiving doses of greater than or equal to 56 Gy \ncompared with those receiving less than or equal to 50.4 Gy.\n54   \nPanel Recommendations  \nFor patients with early -stage disease ( stage I ) and a depth of invasion less \nthan or equal to 1 mm, observation is appropriate following primary \nsurgery  if negative margins  are present,  and the patient does not have any \nprimary risk factors . Risk factors that may require adjuvant EBRT to the \nprimary site are close tumor margins, LVSI, tumor size, depth of invasion, \nand pattern of invasion (spray or diffuse). Those with positive margins \nshould undergo re- excision, or if unresectable without removing proximal  \nurethra/bladder/anus , adjuvant EBRT. After re -excision, the p anel \nrecommends that patients with negative margins undergo observation or \nrisk-factor -dependent EBRT; those with continued positive margins after \nre-excision should all undergo EBRT.130  \nFor patients with stage I B (>1 mm invasion)  and stage II  disease, surgical \nevaluation of the groin is indicated in addition to primary site surgery. \nNodal status is an important determinant of adjuvant therapy \nrecommendations. For patients with a negative SLN or negative IFLNs, \nobservation can be considered.62,131- 134 Adjuvant therapy is warranted if the \nSLN or IFLNs contain metastases. Adjuvant therapy for patients with SLN \ninvolvement includes: 1) RT ±  concurrent chemotherapy; or 2) completion \nIF lymphadenectomy  followed by EBRT ± concurrent chemotherapy. \nAdjuvant therapy for patients who have positive IFLNs detected during IF lymphadenectomy  includes EBRT (category 1) ± concurrent \nchemotherapy. Chemoradiation is strongly recommended for patients with two or more positive IFLNS or a single IFLN with greater than 2-mm \nmetastasis.\n121,125 For patients with locally advanced disease, adjuvant \ntherapy decisions should be made based on clinical evaluation of treatment response after EBRT with concurrent chemotherapy (potentially \npreceded by IF  lymphadenectomy ). These guidelines provide adjuvant \ntherapy recommendations based on whether patients are clinically \nnegative or positive for residual tumor at the primary site and  in the groin. \nPatients with no clinical evidence of residual tumor after EBRT with concurrent chemotherapy should undergo surv eillance. Biopsy of the \ntumor bed can also be considered to confirm p CR. Patients with residual \ntumor should be considered for resection.  In the case of positive margins \non resection, providers should consider additional surgery, additional \nEBRT, and/or systemic therapy, or best supportive care. For unresectable \nresidual disease,  providers should consider additional  EBRT and/or \nsystemic therapy , or best supportive care.   \nSurveillance \nMost recurrences of vulvar cancer occur within the first 1 to 2 years, \nalthough recurrences beyond 5 years have been observed in a significant \nsubset of patients.135,136 Accordingly, long- term follow- up is indicated. \nDefinitive data on an optimal surveillance strategy are lacking.137 However, \nthe panel concurs with the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) \nrecommendations for post -treatment surveillance.138 \nThe recommended surveillance is based on the patient’s risk for recurrence and personal preferences. History and physical examination \nare recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, every 6 to 12 months \nfor another 3 to 5 years, and then annually (see Surveillance in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Vulvar Cancer).

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-14 assessed more frequently ( eg, every 3 months for the first 2 years) than \npatients with low -risk disease ( eg, every 6 months).  \nAnnual cervical/vaginal cytology tests, which may include HPV testing,  can \nbe considered as indicated for detection of lower genital tract dysplasia, \nalthough its value in detecting recurrent cancers is limited and the \nlikelihood of detecting asymptomatic recurrence is low. In addition, the \naccuracy of these tests may be affected in patients who have received pelvic radiation as radiotherapy can induce changes in cellular morphology \nthat may result in cytological misdiagnosis . Imaging ( ie, \nchest/abdomen/pelvis CT, neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis/groin FDG -PET/CT,  \npelvic  MRI) and laboratory testing ( ie, CBC, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], \ncreatinine) are recommended as indicated by suspicious examination \nfindings or symptoms of recurrence.  \nPatient education regarding symptoms suggestive of recurrence or vulvar \ndystrophy is recommended, as well as periodic self -examination. Patients \nshould also be counseled on healthy lifestyle, obesity, nutrition, exercise, \nand sexual health (including vaginal dilator use and \nlubricants/moisturizers) . For information on these and other issues related \nto survivorship ( ie, pain/neuropathy, fear of recurrence, depression), see \nthe Gynecologic Survivorship section at the end of this document and the  \nNCCN Guidelin es for Survivorship (available at www.NCCN.org\n). Smoking \ncessation and abstinence should be encouraged ; see the NCCN \nGuidelines for Smoking Cessation ( available at www.NCCN.org ). \nIf persistent or recurrent disease is suspected, patients should be evaluated using additional imaging studies and biopsy  to confirm local \nand/or distant recurrence  as outlined in the next section.  \nTreatment for Recurrent Disease \nA multicenter case series evaluated the rate and patterns of recurrence among 502 patients, 187 (37%) of who developed a recurrent vulvar SCC. Just over half of recurrences were vulvar (53.4%), followed by inguinal \n(18.7%), multi -site (14.2%), distant (7.9%), and pelvic (5.7%). Survival \nrates at 5 years were 60% for vulvar recurrence, 27% for inguinal/ pelvic, \n15% for distant  sites, and 14% for multiple sites.\n31 While localized vulvar \nrecurrences can be successfully addressed with subsequent surgery, \nsome studies have suggested higher risk of cancer -related death.   \nGiven the rarity of primary vulvar cancer, data for treating recurrences are even scarcer and no clear standard of care exists.\n139 Treatment approach \nand patient outcomes depend on the site and extent of recurrent disease.\n139,140 Isolated local recurrences can often be treated successfully \nwith radical local excision,31,136,141 and RT ± chemotherapy provided some \ndegree of DFS in several studies.92,93 A retrospective review evaluated \npatients with locoregional recurrences  treated via chemoradiation, \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy, or RT alone. Five -year DFS and OS were \naround 20%; however, those with single- site recurrence and lesions less \nthan or equal to 3 cm who received RT dose at or above 64.8 Gy remained disease -free at 5 years.\n142 Conversely, another series noted \ndecline in survival with the presence of nodal metastases, tumors greater \nthan 3 cm, or high- grade lesions.143 For central/large recurrences, pelvic \nexenteration has been shown to prolong survival when performed on \ncarefully selected patients.85,86,144 Regardless of treatment approach, \nprognosis for nodal recurrences was very poor.136,141,143,145,146   \nPanel Recommendations \nIf recurrence is suspected, the panel  recommends workup for metastatic \ndisease with imaging studies to include chest/abdominal/ pelvis CT or \nneck/chest/abdomen/pelvis/groin FDG -PET/CT. Biopsy can be considered \nto confirm local and/or distant metastasis.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-15 Vulva -Confined Recurrence   \nIf recurrence is clinically limited to the vulva with clinically negative nodes, \nand the patient did not receive prior RT, the p anel recommends surgical \nand RT treatment pathways. Surgical recommendations include partial or \ntotal radical vulvectomy ± unilateral or bilateral IF  lymphadenectomy . \nPelvic exenteration can be considered for select cases with a central recurrence. Additional therapy is indicated by margin status and nodal \nstatus. Observation or EBRT is appropriate for negative margins and \nnodes. I n patients with positive margins but no evidence of nodal \ninvolvement, options include re -excision or EBRT ±  brachytherapy and/or \nconcurrent chemotherapy (category 2B for chemotherapy). EBRT ±  \nconcurrent chemotherapy is recommended for patients with negative \nsurgical margins but surgically positive IFLNs. In patients with both \npositive margins and surgically positive IFLNs, the p anel recommends \nEBRT ± brachytherapy, concurrent chemotherapy, and/or re- excision as \nneeded/appropriate.  \nNonsurgical therapy for recurrence includes EBRT ± brachytherapy and/or \nconcurrent chemotherapy. Resection can be considered for patients with \ngross residual tumor. When feasible, partial or total radical vulvectomy is \nalso indicated for patients with vulva -confined recurrence who were \npreviously irradiated. After treatment for recurrence, patients should undergo surveillance.  \nConfirmed  Nodal or Distant Recurrence \nFor patients with multiple pelvic nodes, distant metastasis, or prior pelvic \nEBRT, the p anel recommends s ystemic therapy  and/or selective EBRT (if \nfeasible) or  palliative/best supportive care. If recurrence is limited to \nIF/pelvic LNs, r esection should be considered for clinically enlarged and \nsuspicious nodes . Resection followed by systemic therapy can be \nconsidered for select cases of isolated IF/pelvic recurrence that were \npreviously irradiated. If no prior RT was given, then EBRT ± concurrent chemotherapy is appropriate. All patients should undergo surveillance \nfollowing treatment for recurrence.  \nSystemic Therapy for Recurrent/Metastatic Disease \nNo standard systemic therapy regimens exist for treating advanced or \nrecurrent/metastatic disease. Several reports provide anecdotal evidence \nfor various regimens, at times extrapolating from regimens with known \nactivity in advanced cervical and anal cance rs and other SCCs. See the \nreview article s by Reade et al  and Mahner et al  for an overview of \nsystemic therapies that have been utilized to treat vulvar SCC.112,139 \nPreferred, first -line regimens recommended by the p anel for treating \nadvanced, recurrent/metastatic disease include cisplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/paclitaxel, and cisplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab. \nCarboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab is included as a category 2B regimen \nunder the preferred, first -line options. Other recommended regimens \ninclude single- agent s cisplatin and carboplatin.  \nCisplatin is a commonly employed radiosensitizing agent in locally \nadvanced vulvar cancer, and is recommended for single- agent or \ncombination chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic disease.\n88,147 \nCisplatin/paclitaxel and cisplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab are preferred regimens based on extrapolation of randomized phase III trial data in \nadvanced or recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer.\n148,149 \nCarboplatin is an alternative platinum agent active in metastatic cervical \ncancer that can be used as a single agent or in combination. A small \nseries in 6 patients with advanced or recurrent/metastatic vulvar cancer \nnoted limited clinical benefit of the c ombination regimen;117 however, it has \nbeen included in these guidelines based on data from patients with \nadvanced or recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer that suggest non -\ninferiority to cisplatin.150,151  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-16 For the second -line or subsequent treatment, the NCCN Panel has listed \npaclitaxel , erlotinib (category 2B for erlotinib),  and cisplatin/gemcitabine \n(category 2B) as options.  \nSingle -agent paclitaxel was modestly active  in a phase II trial of 31 \nfemales with advanced, recurrent/metastatic vulvar cancer, generating a \nresponse rate of 14% and PFS of 2.6 months.118 Erlotinib was studied in a \nphase II trial that included a cohort of females with metastatic disease. \nShort -duration responses were observed, with partial responses and \nstable disease noted in 27.5% and 40% of enrolled patients, \nrespectively.119 Cisplatin/gemcitabine is also included as a category 2B \noption extrapolating from cervical cancer data; however, findings from \ncase reports have been mixed.152,153 \nIn the recent Guidelines update, the NCCN P anel also included \ncemiplimab as a second- line or subsequent therapy option under “other \nrecommended regimens. ” The recommendation of cemiplimab has been \nextrapolated from its efficacy shown in cervical cancer and in advanced \ncutaneous SCC. In a phase 2 trial with patients with metastatic cutaneous \nSCC, a response was observed in 28 out of 59 patients.154 Median follow -\nup was 7.9 months. The phase 3, randomized, Empower -Cervical- 1 \nclinical trial evaluated the efficacy of cemiplimab or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (topotecan, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, irinotecan, or \npemetrexed) in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who \nhave progressed on prior therapy. The trial enrolled 608 patients who had \npreviously received one or more lines of systemic therapy for recurrence; \nthey were randomized to either receive cemiplimab or chemotherapy. The \nmedian OS and PFS were significantly longer in the cemiplimab arm than in the control arm (12 months vs . 8.5 months; HR , 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56–\n0.84; P < .001 and 2.8 vs . 2.9 months; HR , 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63 –0.89; P < \n.001, respectively). Sixteen percent  of the patients in the test arm achieved an OR (95% CI, 12.5– 21.1) as compared to 6.3% (95% CI, 3.8–\n9.6) in the chemotherapy arm.\n155 \nBiomarker -directed systemic therapies are an emerging class of \ntreatments that may be useful in patients with advanced or \nrecurrent/metastatic cancer. Monoclonal antibodies  that function as  \nprogrammed cell death protein 1  (PD-1) inhibitors are one such example \nof these treatments. PD -1 functions as an immune checkpoint protein that \npromotes  antitumor T-cell activity . Many tumors , including vulvar cancer, \nare known to  overexpress PD -L1, which  disrupts PD-1 function. Thus, \nblocking PD -L1/PD -1 binding restores  T-cell–mediated antitumor \nactivity.156-158 An estimated 10% to 50%  of vulvar cancers express PD -\nL1.159,160  \nPembrolizumab is one such PD -1 inhibitor  that may be effective in patients \nwith vulvar cancer . A case study was published of a single patient with \nrecurrent vulvar SCC who was treated with single- agent pembrolizumab, \nas part of a phase II basket clinical trial to evaluate efficacy and safety ,161 \nand had 30% reduction in tumor lesions before the treatment was \ndiscontinued due to grade 3 mucositis.162 The single- arm phase II  \nKEYNOTE- 158 basket trial (NCT02628067 ) measured response to \npembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumor s that \nprogressed after  standard- of-care systemic therapy .163 Among 101 \npatients enrolled in the vulvar SCC cohort, median follow -up was 36 \nmonths. The overall  response rate ( ORR ) was 10.9% overall, 9.5% in the  \nPD-L1–positive population, and 28.6% among the PD-L1–negative \npopulation. Median PFS and OS were 2.1 and 6.2 months, respectively.164 \nPembrolizumab is FDA -approved for recurrent or metastatic cervical \ncancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy whose tumors \nexpress PD -L1 (CPS ≥1) . The panel has added pembrolizumab as a \nrecommended second- line, useful in certain circumstances option for PD -\nL1–positive advanced or recurrent/metastatic vulvar cancer.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nVulvar Cancer   \n \nMS-17 Monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD -1 pathway may also be effective \nin tumors  that have high TMB  (TMB -H) or are deficient in MMR  \n(dMMR)/have high levels of  MSI (MSI -H). Of the 71 patients  in the \nKEYNOTE- 158 trial with advanced vulvar cancer, 12 had TMB -H tumors. \nThe ORR for TMB -H vulvar cancer was approximately 17%, while the \nORR for non –TMB -H disease was 3.4%.165 The KEYNOTE -158 study \nauthors also analyzed pembrolizumab response in 233 enrolled patients \nwith non- colorectal  MSI-H/dMMR  tumors, one of which had vulvar cancer.  \nORR for the entire cohort  was 34.3%. Median PFS was 4.1 months  and \nmedian OS was 23.5 mon ths.166 Based on these data, the FDA expanded \npembrolizumab’s approval for treatment of TMB -H and MSI-H/dMMR \ntumors  that progressed after prior therapy, regardless of tumor type.167,168 \nBased on these additional data/FDA approvals , the panel also \nrecommends pembrolizumab as a second- line, useful in certain \ncircumstances option for  patients with  advanced or recurrent/metastatic  \nvulvar cancer  whose tumors are MSI -H/dMMR or TMB -H. \nNivolumab is another  PD-1 inhibitor shown to have some efficacy in \ncertain patients with vulvar cancer. The single- arm phase I/II CheckMate \n358 trial  (NCT02488759 ) measured response to nivolumab monotherapy \nin a small cohort of 5 patients with recurrent or metastatic vaginal or vulvar \ncancer who were HPV -positive or had an unknown HPV status. The 12- \nand 18- month OS rates for the combined cohort were 40% and 20%, \nrespectively; 6 -month PFS was 40%.169 Based on these data, the panel \nadded nivolumab as a second- line, useful in certain circumstances option \nfor HPV -related advanced or recurrent/metastatic vulvar cancer. \nNTRK  gene fusions  lead to constitutively active tropomyosin receptor \nkinases (TRKs), which in turn promote development and progression of \ncancer. Approximately 0.3% of solid tumors express NTRK  gene fusions, \nalthough expression varies widely by cancer type.170 Entrectinib and \nlarotrectinib are broadly active TRK  inhibitors that are effective in patients with a variety of advanced or metastatic NTRK  fusion -positive solid \ntumors.170-172 In a primary analysis, the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib \nwas reported in 55 patients enrolled in three clinical studies who had \nlocally advanced or metastatic tumors with NTRK  gene fusions and had \nprogressed on standard chemotherapy received previously.171 The three \nclinical trials included a phase 1 dose -finding study in adults, phase 1 /2 \ndose- finding study in the pediatric population, and a phase 2, single- arm, \nbasket trial. The ORR of larotrectinib in these patients was 75% (95% CI, \n61%–85%) , with 22% complete response and 53% partial response with \nmedian duration of response and PFS not reached at the time. In a long-term follow- up analysis, out of 153 patients, 121 patients (79% ; 95% CI, \n72–85) had objective response with 16% having a complete response,  \n63% having a partial response, and 12% having stable disease. The \nmedian duration of response was 35.2 months (22.8– NE) and the median \nPFS was 28.3 months.\n173 Similarly, entrectinib showed a durable and \nclinically meaningful response in 54 patients with advanced/metastatic \nNTRK  gene fusion tumors enrolled in three phase 1/2 clinical trials with \n57.4% ORR, 10.4- month median duration of response, and 11.2 -month \nmedian PFS.170 In a long- term efficacy and safety analysis in 121 patients \nat median follow- up of 25.8 months, 61% reported complete or partial \nresponses, and median  duration of response  was 20 months (95% CI, \n10.1– 19.9). Both larotrectinib and entrectinib are FDA -approved for NTRK  \ngene fusion solid tumors for patients who have progressed following \ntreatment or have no satisfactory standard therapy. The NCCN Guidelines \nfor Vulvar Cancer recommend larotrectinib and entrectinib as a second -\nline or subsequent, useful in certain circumstances option for NTRK  gene \nfusion- positive tumors and recently changed the category of evidence from \ncategory 2B to category 2A.  \nGynecologic Survivorship \nTreatment for gynecologic cancer typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, RT, and/or immunotherapy , which may PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.

Surgical approaches \nmay be extensive and  cause adhesions to form , which in turn may cause \npain and contribute to the development of small bowel obstruction, urinary \nor gastrointestinal complications ( eg, incontinence, diarrhea), pelvic floor \ndysfunction (manifested by a variety of urinary, bowel, and/or sexual \neffects), and lymphedema.174,175 Chemotherapy agents vary, though \ncommonly used regimens may pose a significant risk of neurotoxicity, \ncardiac toxicity, cognitive dysfunction, and the development of \nhematologic cancers.176 Long- term estrogen deprivation may cause \nsymptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and bone loss. RT  may \ncause long- term complications ( eg, fibrosis,  stenosis,  vulvovaginal \natrophy)177,178 and may predispose patients to subsequent  cancers of the \nskin, subcutaneous tissue, and/or underlying organs that are proximal to \nthe radiation field.179 Prior pelvic RT may contribute to bone loss and \nincrease the risk of pelvic fractures. Consideration should be given to bone density testing and prophylactic use of bisphosphonates, particularly in \npatients with osteoporosis. Use of i mmunotherapy agents  in gynecologic \ncancers is emerging, and to date, long- term effects of these treatments \nare unknown.\n180,181  \nFollowing completion of treatment, all gynecologic cancer survivors should \nreceive regular general medical care that focuses on managing chronic \ndiseases ( eg, depression, diabetes, hypertension), monitoring \ncardiovascular risk factors, receiving recommended vaccinations, and encouraging adoption of a healthy lifestyle ( eg, promoting exercise, \nsmoking cessation).\n182,183 In order to assess the late and long- term effects \nof gynecologic cancers, clinicians should comprehensively document the \npatient’s history, including prior treatment history, and conduct a thorough \nphysical examination  and provide any necessary imaging and/or \nlaboratory testing.183 As most treatments for gynecologic cancers will \ncause sexual dysfunction, early menopause, and infertility, special \nattention to the resultant medical and psychosocial implications is needed. All patients , whether sexually active or not, should be asked about \ngenitourinary symptoms, including vulvovaginal dryness.184 Post-radiation \nuse of vaginal dilators and moisturizers is recommended.177,185 For \ntreatment -related menopause, hormone therapy should be considered. \nPsychosocial  effects may include psychological ( eg, depression, anxiety, \nfear of recurrence, altered body image), financial ( eg, return to work, \ninsurance concerns), and interpersonal ( eg, relationships, sexuality, \nintimacy).183 Patients should be referred to appropriate specialty providers \n(eg, physical therapy, pelvic floor therapy, sexual therapy, psychotherapy) \nas needed, based on prior treatment history and assessed risk of \ndeveloping late effects and/or existing concerns.  \nCommunication and coordination with all clinicians involved in the care of \nsurvivors, including primary care clinicians, is critical.183,186 Providing \nsurvivors with a summary of their treatment and recommendations for \nfollow- up is also recommended. To this end, the SGO has developed \ntemplates for gynecologic cancer -specific Survivorship Care Plans to aid \nsurvivors and their clinicians in summarizing cancer history, treatments \nreceived, possible side effects, and recommended follow -up.187 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:12:49 PM.
