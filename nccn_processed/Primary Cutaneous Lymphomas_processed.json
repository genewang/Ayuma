Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL)\n• Most common subtype of PCBCL (57%),1,2 located primarily in the scalp, face, forehead, and trunk, usually with indolent course and excellent \nprognosis (5-year overall survival [OS] rate is >95%).\n• Typically presents as solitary, firm, and pink to violaceous papules, nodules, plaques, or tumors. Multifocal skin lesions are seen in 15% of cases.1,2 \nUlceration is rare.\n• Dissemination to extracutaneous sites is extremely uncommon; cutaneous recurrences occur near the initial site in approximately 30% of cases.\n2. Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) (WHO5)/Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoproliferative disorder (ICC)\n• Second most common subtype of PCBCL (24%–31%)1 with distribution primarily on the trunk, upper extremities, and head. Typically presents as \nsolitary or multiple erythematous to violaceous papules, small nodules, plaques, or tumors with indolent course and excellent prognosis (5-year \nsurvival rate is 99%).\n• Relapses in the skin occur in 50% of patients.\n3. Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PCDLBCL, leg type)\n• The rarest subtype of PCBCL (11%–19%), constituting 4% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas. It is distributed mostly to the leg, but not \nuncommonly (10%–15%) can be found in other sites.1\n• Typical clinical presentation is red to bluish plaques or tumors located on one or both legs that can ulcerate.\n• It is usually aggressive and associated with a poor prognosis (high frequency of extracutaneous relapses) (5-year OS rate is 50%).2,3\n• Multiple skin lesions, inactivation of CDKN2A , and MYD88 L265P associated with inferior prognosis.PRINCIPLES FOR PRIMARY CUTANEOUS B-CELL LYMPHOMAS (PCBCL)\nContinued\nReferences on CUTB/INTRO-APLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

CD10 can \nbe negative in cases with diffuse growth pattern. BCL2 is usually negative, or minimally expressed.\n\u0017When CD10 and BCL2 are strongly expressed, or BCL2 is rearranged, consider a nodal follicular lymphoma (FL) with secondary skin involvement.\n\u0017PCFCL is most frequently germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype.4 Germinal (or follicle) center phenotype with diffuse large cells in a skin lesion may still \nbe consistent with PCFCL PCFCL can also present with a mixed nodular/diffuse or purely diffuse pattern that is similar to GCB immunophenotype, which \ncan be easily misdiagnosed as DLBCL.\n• PCMZL: punch biopsy/incision/excision of skin lesion preferred to shave biopsy\n\u0017Immunophenotype – cells are negative for CD10 and BCL6, but are often positive for BCL2, CD20, and CD79a. IgG4 can be expressed in about a third of \ncases.\n\u0017Can be divided into 2 groups with different prognosis based on the immunoglobulin heavy chain IgH gene rearrangement: 1) CXCR3-negative and Ig \nclass-switched subtype (IgG, IgA, and IgE), characterized by nodular infiltrates of plasma cells; and 2) a less common subtype that is CXCR3-positive \nand IgM positive (non class-switched), which may have extracutaneous extension.5-8 IgG class-switched subtype is a clonal chronic lymphoproliferative \ndisorder (LPD), with indolent course.8,9\n• PCDLBCL, leg type: punch biopsy/incision/excision of skin lesion preferred to shave biopsy \n\u0017Immunophenotype – cells express CD20, CD79a, monotypic immunoglobulins, BCL2 (strong), IRF/MUM1, FOXP1, IgM, and occasionally MYC. CD10 \nstaining is usually negative. Immunophenotype may vary with poor correlation with Hans algorithm, but most cases are positive for MUM1 and BCL2 with \nvariable expression of other markers.\n\u0017Gene expression profiling: PCDLBCL, leg type has been demonstrated to be most commonly activated B-cell (ABC) subtype. Gain-of-function mutations \nin MYD88 and CD79B  co-occur in the so-called \"MCD\" subtype, and are specific to PCDLBCL, leg type.4\nGeneral Principles\n• PCFCL, PCMZL: If the pathology or clinical presentation is not typical, complete staging with chest/abdomen/pelvis C T and/or FDG-PET/\nCT scan to rule out systemic involvement. Low-dose localized radiation therapy (RT), topical or intralesional steroids, or observation are \nexcellent treatment options.\n• PCDLBCL, leg type: Complete staging with FDG-PET/CT scan. Treat with chemoimmunotherapy and localized RT.

SS is rare, accounting for less than \n5% of cutaneous lymphomas and predominantly affects older individuals.\n\u0017SS is characterized by the presence of atypical T cells (Sézary cells) in skin causing diffuse erythema (erythroderma) and significant blood \ninvolvement with abnormal T cells (>1000 abnormal cells/uL) defined as Sézary cells by cytopathologic assessment or flow cytometry \n(abnormal subsets including but not limited to CD4+CD7- or CD4+CD26- cells; TRBC1 may contribute in detecting clonality and can improve \nthe specificity of detecting Sezary cells when CD7 and CD26 are lost.3\n\u0017SS is thought to arise from thymic memory T cells, while skin resident effector memory T cells are the cells of origin of MF . This supports the \ncontention that SS is a process distinct from MF.4 Cases presenting clinically as an overlap of these two conditions exist.\nDiagnosis\n• The histopathologic findings of MF, even in cases showing classic features, need to be correlated with clinical presentation in order to reach a \ndefinitive diagnosis.5\n• Patch lesions are often difficult for conclusive diagnosis; thus, in some instances multiple skin biopsies may be necessary for diagnosis. \nStopping skin-directed therapy for 2–3 weeks or longer to individual lesions before obtaining a skin biopsy is advisable and may aid in \ndiagnosis.1,2\n• Awareness of specific clinicopathologic variants may aid in accurate diagnosis:\n\u0017Lesions may be hyper- or hypopigmented.\n\u0017Folliculotropic MF (FMF) may present as folliculocentric papules or nodules or areas of alopecia in any hair-bearing area of the body . A skin \nbiopsy reaching the deep dermis may be required to assess adnexal structures.\n\u0017Unilesional, pagetoid reticulosis and CD8+ MF variants tend to be associated with an indolent course. \n\u0017Granulomatous slack skin is rare and presents with redundant skin resembling cutis laxa on flexural areas.\n• By IHC, the tumor cells are usually CD3+, CD4+, and CD8-, although CD8+ variants are not uncommon. In selected cases, additional IHC \nmarkers and molecular studies to evaluate clonal TCR gene rearrangements are necessary for diagnosis.\n• Large-cell transformation (LCT) of MF is defined histologically as greater than 25% of the tumor cells displaying large size. CD30 expression \nmay be seen but is not included in the definition of LCT.6\n• The histopathologic findings of SS in skin are generally similar to, but may be more subtle than those seen in MF . Correlation with clinical and \nlaboratory findings in blood is essential for a definitive diagnosis.\nGeneral Principles on MFSS/INTRO-2PRINCIPLES FOR MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES/SÉZARY SYNDROME (MF/SS)\nReferences on MFSS/INTRO-APLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

Treatment may require skin-directed therapy that reaches the subcutaneous tissue (eg, psoralen \nplus ultraviolet A [PUVA], involved-site RT [ISRT]) or the addition of systemic therapy as used for stages I–IIB in patients with disease not \nresponding to skin-directed therapy alone.\n• The incidence of LCT is strongly dependent on the disease stage at diagnosis.10,11 LCT often but not always corresponds to a more \naggressive growth rate requiring systemic therapies (MFSS-12).\n• Goals of therapy should be individualized but often include:\n\u0017Attain adequate response in order to reduce and control symptoms and minimize risk of progression.\n\u0017Most treatments for MF/SS do not result in durable remissions off of treatment.\n\u0017Therapies with lower side-effect profiles and an absence of cumulative toxicity are often given in an ongoing or maintenance fashion to \nimprove and maintain disease control and quality of life. \n\u0017Other than allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), therapies are not given with curative intent.\n• Generally, skin-directed therapies and systemic therapy regimens that can be tolerated for longer durations of therapy with lower rates of \ncumulative toxicity, less immunosuppression, and/or higher efficacy are used in earlier lines of therapy. \n• In patients requiring chemotherapy, single agents are preferred over combination chemotherapy, due to the higher toxicity profiles \nassociated with multi-agent regimens and the short-lived responses seen with time-limited combination chemotherapy.  \n• Responses can vary between the different compartments (ie, skin, blood, lymph nodes). Often decisions to continue or switch therapy are on \na clinical basis.\n• Disease relapse after discontinuation of therapy may respond to re-treatment with previous therapy.\n• Patients having partial responses with suboptimal quality of life should be treated with other or additional primary treatment options.\n• Use of supportive care measures to minimize risk of skin infections and treat pruritus is an important part of disease and symptom control \n(MFSS-B).\nReferences on MFSS/INTRO-APRINCIPLES FOR MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES/SÉZARY SYNDROME (MF/SS)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

Other systemic therapies such as interferons (alfa and gamma), methotrexate, \nand other retinoids (acitretin and isotretinoin) also offer clinical benefit but have only been evaluated in small studies. \n• The optimal treatment for any patient at any given time is often individualized based on symptoms of disease, route of administration, \ntoxicities, and overall goals of therapy. \n• Use of supportive care measures to minimize risk of skin infections and treat pruritus is an important part of disease and symptom control \n(MFSS-B).PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

Therefore, the choice of whether \nto use PUVA is typically based on its deeper penetration in the \nskin, an important factor for patients with thick plaque disease or \nfolliculotropism, particularly if phototherapy is used as sole therapy. \n• NBUVB is available in many more offices than PUVA and also as a \nhome panel or unit.\n• Hand/foot PUVA is an office-based procedure that can be used at \nthe end of a treatment with whole body PUVA or NBUVB. If using \nfollowing NBUVB, this involves a topical psoralen applied 20-30 \nminutes prior to UVA exposure.\n• UVA1 (available in limited centers) may offer deeper skin penetration \nwithout the need for psoralen and thus would allow for its use during \npregnancy.\n• Relative exclusions for NBUVB and PUVA include multiple NMSCs, \nphotosensitivity (inherent, drug, or underlying condition) as well as \nphysical and/or financial limitations.\n• NBUVB and PUVA have certain exclusions for treatment based on \nmedical conditions:\n\u0017Xeroderma pigmentosa and photosensitive collagen vascular \ndiseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for both \nPUVA and NBUVB\n\u0017Melanoma and pregnancy for PUVA\n\u0017Porphyria for NBUVB\n\u0017Patients with a previously treated isolated thin melanoma that can \nbe excluded from the field of UV light might be considered in certain \ncircumstances for NBUVB. \n1 Olsen, EA, Hodak E, Anderson T et al Guidelines for phototherapy of mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome: A consensus statement of the United States \nCutaneous\tLymphoma\tConsortium.\tJ\t Am\tAcad\tDermatol\t2016;74:27-58.\tPlease\tsee\thandout\tinformation\tfor\tpatients\twith\tMF/SS\twho\tyou\tplan\tto\ttreat\twith\t\neither\tNBUVB\tor\tPUVA.Dosing Guidelines\n• The Fitzpatrick skin phototype is typically used to determine the \ninitial and incremental energy dose for an individual patient. \n• When starting phototherapy, concomitant medications that are \nphotosensitizers (such as the tetracyclines, amiodarone, and \nhydrochlorothiazide), a history of treatment that may have induced \nphotosensitivity (such as mogamulizumab), recent TSEBT, or \nthe presence of erythroderma should trigger consideration \nof decreasing the starting dose and reducing the rate of light \nescalation to prevent burning.\n• If one of the retinoids (bexarotene, acitretin or isotretinoin; all \nphotosensitizing) or systemic methotrexate is being added to \nphototherapy to enhance efficacy, consider lowering the current \ndose of light when starting the medication and taking the oral \nmedication after, not immediately before, phototherapy.\n• If phototherapy is being added to a treatment regimen that already \nincludes a retinoid, the initial and incremental energy dose may \nneed to be reduced and adjusted. \n• Patients that do not have involvement of their face may help to \nprevent skin cancers and accelerated aging by covering their face \nduring phototherapy, recognizing that doing so, like covering \ngenitals (recommended in males), creates a “privileged” site. \n• Topical medications, such as topical mechlorethamine or topical \nbexarotene, can be used with phototherapy but should be applied \nafter, not before, phototherapy. \n• Patients on long term phototherapy, alone or in combination with \nother systemic or topical agents, should be on the lowest dose/\nleast frequent dosing to maintain response and carefully monitored \nfor the development of actinic keratoses, NMSCs, and melanoma.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

Extracutaneous disease occurs in about 10% of cases, \nusually involving regional lymph nodes.a Patches and plaques may \nalso be present and some degree of spontaneous remittance in \nlesions may also be seen.\n• Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) \n\u0017LyP is included under the classification system for lymphomas \n(WHO-EORTC) but may be best classified a s an LPD as it is a \nfrequently spontaneously regressing process.a\n\u0017LyP has been reported to be associated with other lymphomas \nsuch as MF, PC-ALCL, systemic ALCL, or Hodgkin lymphoma.f,g\n\u0017Lyp is h istologically  heterogeneous w ith large atypical anaplastic, \nimmunoblastic, or Hodgkin-like cells in a marked inflammatory \nbackgrounda; several histologic subtypes can be defined based on \nevolution of skin lesions.f\n\u0017Lyp clinical features are characterized by chronic, recurrent, \nspontaneously regressing papulonodular (grouped or generalized) \nskin lesions.a,fPRINCIPLES OF PRIMARY CUTANEOUS CD30+ T-CELL LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS (LPD)\ne Woo\tDK,\tet\tal.\t Arch\tDermatol\t2009;145:667-674.\nf Kempf\tW,\tet\tal.\tBlood\t2011;118:4024-4035.\ng Due to overlapping immunophenotype and morphology, need to use caution to not \ndiagnose\tCD30+\t T-cell\tin\tlymph\tnodes\tas\tHL \t(Eberle\tFC,\tet\tal.\t Am\tJ\tSurg\tPathol\t\n2012;36:716-725).PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

The following guidelines are based on expert consensus. Treatment options \nare based on the presence of HLH and tumor burden as outlined in SPTCL-2 and SPTCL-3. \n• SPTCL is a very rare condition characterized by mature medium size CD8+ activated T-cells with tropism towards adipocytes in the \nsubcutaneous tissue and in extraordinary cases involving adipocytes at other sites, like mesentery.\n• Patients with SPTCL tend to be young, often with a personal or family history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune \ndisorders.\n• The presentation includes non-ulcerated deep nodules typically involving legs and other sites. The process may resolve with areas of \nlipodystrophy and hyperpigmentation.\n• Fever and malaise are commonly observed at presentation. Signs and symptoms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) may \noccasionally lead to severe morbidity or mortality. Markers of HLH should be checked when SPTCL is suspected with ferritin levels as a \nreliable marker to assess disease evolution (See NCCN Guidelines for T-Cell Lymphomas (TCLYM-B [4 of 4]). \n• Rimming of bone marrow adipocytes by CD8+ T-cells may be observed, but tumoral growth in nodal, bone marrow, or mesenchymal organs \nis not typically seen. This limited growth potential, along with the lack of common lymphoma driver mutations and the frequent detection \nof germline mutations in the HAVCR2 gene suggest an immune dysregulation characterized by unchecked activated T-cells driving the \nprocess. HAVCR2 encodes for T-cell immunoglobulin and Mucin-domain protein 3 (TIM-3), a membrane modulator of immune response \nresulting in hemophagocytosis and uncontrolled activation of the innate immune system. HAVCR2 mutations appears to be more prevalent \nin patients of Asian ancestry.

However , when the depth of disease is \nnot evident or when disease extends around curved surfaces, treatment planning may be facilitated by ultrasound imaging or CT-based \nsimulation and planning. Incorporating other modern imaging like PET and MRI may enhance treatment volume determination in some \ncases.\n\u0017ISRT targets the site of skin involvement. The volume encompasses the clinically evident disease with adequate margins. \n\u0017The visible or palpable disease defines the gross tumor volume (GTV) and provides the basis for determining the CTV . If using CT-based \nplanning, delineating tumor boundary with wire for CT simulation will guide treatment volumes. Concerns for questionable subclinical \ndisease and uncertainties in original imaging accuracy or localization will lead to expansion of the CTV and are determined individually \nusing clinical judgment but generally include a margin of 1–2 cm both circumferentially and in depth. The CTV need not be expanded into \nintact bone.\n\u0017The planning target volume (PTV) is an additional expansion of the CTV that accounts only for setup variations (see ICRU definitions).\n\u0017The treatment plan is designed using conventional or 3-D conformal techniques using clinical treatment planning considerations of \ncoverage and dose reductions for organs at risk (OARs). \n• ISRT for nodal disease:\n\u0017Principles of Radiation Therapy for T-Cell Lymphomas (Target Volumes: ISRT for nodal disease).\n\u0017Principles of Radiation Therapy for B-Cell Lymphomas (Target Volumes: ISRT for nodal disease).\nContinued a References\ton\tPCLYM-A \t3\tof\t3.• Radiation Dose Constraints – Recommendations for normal tissue dose constraints can be found in the Principles of \nRadiation Therapy NCCN Guidelines for Hodgkin LymphomaPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

Alternatively, lower doses (eg, 4 Gy) may be used initially, \nwith supplemental RT (4–20 Gy) for inadequate response or subsequent local relapse though data with this approach are limited.\n ◊Surface margins beyond area of clinically evident disease will vary depending on lesion size and body site and must take into account \ndosimetry of the beam being used. Surface margins of 1.0–1.5 cm are generally adequate.\n ◊Margins in depth should include the volume at risk for involvement.\n ◊Generally, treatment with 6–9 MeV electrons (with surface bolus) provides an adequate depth of treatment. Alternatively, low-energy \nx-rays (~100 Kv) may be used. \n ◊Doses as low as 4 Gy are used occasionally, but data are limited regarding response and duration.\n\u0017RT for relapsed disease: 4 Gy EBRT may be adequate.\n• MF/SS\n\u0017Treatment of individual patches, plaques, or tumors\n ◊Optimal management for individual plaque and tumor lesions is with EBRT. Low-dose local RT (8–12 Gy) is given with palliative intent \n(usually as combined modality therapy). Some Member Institutions are exploring the use of lower dose options (eg, 4 Gy). Up to 8 Gy can \nbe given in a single fraction, although lower dose per fraction (3–5 Gy) may be preferred depending on skin condition, irradiation volume, \nand prior RT.\n ◊For unilesional MF at initial presentation, the definitive RT dose is 24–30 Gy . \n ◊Surface margins beyond area of clinically evident disease will vary depending on lesion size and body site and must take into account \ndosimetry of the beam being used. Surface margins of 1.0–1.5 cm are generally adequate.\n ◊Margins in depth should include the volume at risk for involvement.\n ◊Generally, treatment with 6–9 MeV electrons (with surface bolus) provides an adequate depth of treatment. Alternatively, low-energy \nx-rays (~100 Kv) may be used.\n ◊For certain body surfaces, higher energy photon fields and opposed-field treatment (with bolus) may be required.\n\u0017TSEBT\n ◊A variety of techniques may be utilized to cover the entire cutaneous surface. Patients are generally treated in the standing position on \na rotating platform or with multiple body positions to ensure total skin coverage.\n ◊The common dose is ~12 Gy, generally 4–6 Gy per week. Higher doses (24–36 Gy) have been used for more extensive or refractory \ndisease. The advantages of a lower dose includes fewer short-term complications and better ability to retreat for relapsed disease\n ◊“Shadowed” areas may need to be supplemented with individual electron fields.\n ◊Individual tumors may be boosted with doses of 4–12 Gy.\n ◊For patients with recalcitrant sites after generalized skin treatment, additional local treatment may be needed.\na References\ton\tPCLYM-A \t3\tof\t3.ContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

The test targets the gamma and/or beta TCR genes using PCR methods \nwith capillary or gel electrophoresis detection methods. Alternatively, HTS methods are increasingly utilized. HTS methods are more \nsensitive, precise, and capable of providing a unique sequence of the T -cell clone, which allows for comparison and confirmation of \ndisease evolution and monitoring during remission. Clonal T-cell expansions can also be detected using V beta families in blood or tissue \nwith flow cytometry methods.\n• Diagnostic value: \n\u0017Clonal TCR gene rearrangements without cytologic histopathologic and immunophenotypic evidence of abnormal T-cell population does \nnot constitute a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma since it can be identified in patients with non-malignant conditions. Conversely, a negative \nresult does not exclude the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma, which occasionally may fail TCR amplification. Nonetheless, it often provides \nessential information and increased precision for many of these complex diagnoses.\n• Prognostic value: \n\u0017Identification of clonal TCR gene rearrangement has no definitive established prognostic value; however , it could be helpful when used to \ndetermine clinical staging or assess relapsed or residual disease.\na References\ton\tPCLYM-B\t2\tof\t2.DUSP22-IRF4  Gene Rearrangement\n• Testing for DUSP22  (dual-specificity phosphatase 22) rearrangement is considered useful under certain circumstances for the diagnosis of \nprimary cutaneous CD30+ T-cell LPDs.\n• Diseases: \n\u0017Primary cutaneous CD30+ T-cell LPDs\n• Description: \n\u0017DUSP22  is a tyrosine/threonine/serine phosphatase that may function as a tumor suppressor gene. DUSP22  inactivation contributes to \nthe development of PTCLs. \n• Detection: \n\u0017FISH using probes to DUPS22-IRF4  gene region at 6p25.3\n• Diagnostic value: \n\u0017DUSP22  rearrangement has been described in patients with PC-ALCL and LyP but is not associated with prognostic significance.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-2  \n \nOverview \nPrimary cutaneous lymphomas (PCL) are a heterogenous group of \nextranodal B -cell and T -cell non- Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) originating in \nand usually confined to the skin.  \nIn the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results  (SEER) database \npopulation- based analysis of 3884 cases of PCL diagnosed in the United \nStates from 2001 to 2005, the incidence of cutaneous B -cell lymphomas \n(CBCL) and cutaneous T -cell lymphomas (CTCL) accounted for 29% and \n71%, respectively.1 An updated SEER database analysis of data from 18-\npopulation- based registries reported an overall increase in the incidence of \nCTCL between 2000 and 2018 in the United States (14,942 people were \ndiagnosed with CTCL during that period), with mycosis fungoi des (MF) \nbeing the most common diagnosis, followed by primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PCALCL).\n2 \nThe World Health Organization- European Organization for Research and \nTreatment of Cancer (WHO -EORTC) classification for cutaneous \nlymphomas was first published in 2005 and was subsequently updated in \n2018.3,4  \nThe subtypes of PCL that are covered in the NCCN Clinical Practice \nGuidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) are listed below:  \n• Cutaneous B -Cell Lymphomas  \n Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL)  \n Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL)  \n Primary cutaneous diffuse large B -cell lymphoma, leg type \n(PCDLBCL, leg type)  • Cutaneous T -Cell Lymphomas  \n Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS)  \n Primary cutaneous CD30+ T- cell lymphoproliferative disorders \n(PCTLD)  \n Subcutaneous panniculitis -like T -cell lymphoma  (SPTCL)  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines® are available at www.NCCN.org . \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist , and anti -weight -biased; and \ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. \nNCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing \non organ -specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inc lusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the inform ation is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \n  This discussion corresponds to the NCCN Guidelines for Primary Cutaneous  \nLymphomas .

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-3 Primary Cutaneous B- Cell Lymphomas  \nPrimary cutaneous B -cell lymphomas (PCBCL) account for mainly three \nsubtypes: PCMZL, PCFCL, and PCDLBCL, leg type.3,4 PCFCL is the most \ncommon subtype of CBCL, diagnosed in 57% of patients followed by \nPCMZL (24% –31%) and PCDLBCL, leg type (11% –19%).5,6  \nIn addition to these three subtypes, PCDLBCL, not otherwise specified \n(PCDLBCL -NOS) with clinicopathologic features intermediate between \nPCFCL and PCDLBCL, leg type has also been described.7,8 In the revised \n2018 WHO -EORTC classification, rare cases that cannot be classified as \neither PCDLBCL, leg type or PCFCL are classified as PCDLBCL- NOS.4  \nPCFCL is more prevalent in the scalp, face, and forehead, whereas the \ntrunk and extremities are the most common sites for PCMZL.5,6 PCMZL \nand PCFCL are generally indolent or slow growing and both are \nassociated with excellent prognosis. PCMZL is now recognized as a \ndistinct entity from other mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) \nlymphomas in both the International Consensus Classification (ICC) and \nupdated WHO classification (WHO5).9,10 In the ICC, PCMZL are defined \nas primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoproliferative disorders because of their indolent disease course.\n10   \nPCDLBCL, leg type is found most commonly on the leg, although it can \narise at other sites.5,6 PCDLBCL, leg type is usually aggressive and \nassociated with a generally poorer prognosis (mainly due to the higher frequency of extracutaneous relapses).\n5,6 In a large Italian series of 467 \npatients with PCBCL, extracutaneous involvement was reported in 17% of patients with PCDLBCL, leg type compared to 6% of patients with PCMZL \nand 11% with PCFCL.\n5 The 5- year overall survival (OS) rate was \nsignificantly higher for patients with PCMZL and PCFCL than for patients \nwith PCDLBCL, leg type (97%, 96%, and 73%, respectively; P < .0001).5 \nIn patients with PCMZL and PCFCL, the disease -free survival (DFS) and OS rates were significantly higher for patients with single lesions \ncompared with those with regional or disseminated lesions (5 -year DFS, \n62% vs. 44%; 5- year OS, 97% vs. 85%), whereas the difference in \noutcomes between single and regional or disseminated lesions was not \nsignificant in patients with PCDLBCL, leg type (5- year DFS rate 55% vs. \n44%; 5- year OS rate 79% vs. 67% for single and regional or disseminated \nlesions, respectively).5 In the report from the Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma \nRegistry that included 300 patients with PCBCL, the incidence of \nextracutaneous relapse was 47% among patients with PCDLBCL, leg type \ncompared to 11% and 9%, respectively, for patients with PCFCL and \nPCMZL.6 The 5 -year disease- specific survival rates in this series were \n95%, 98%, and 50% for PCFCL, PCMZL, and PCDLBCL,  leg type, \nrespectively.  \nWhile the diagnosis of PCMZL is generally straightforward and \nreproducible among pathologists, it is more difficult to distinguish between \nPCFCL and PCDLBCL, leg type, partly because the cell size (large vs. \nsmall) is not a defining feature as it is in nodal B -cell lymphomas. \nDisease -specific characteristics identified by molecular and gene \nexpression profiling (GEP) studies (as described below) may be helpful \nto distinguish the subtypes of CBCL.11 \nPCMZL can be divided into two subgroups with different prognosis based \non the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain usage, with the vast majority \nbeing Ig class -switched subtype (IgG/IgG4, IgA, and IgE), CXCR3 and \nIgM negative and a small subset being CXCR3 posi tive and IgM \npositive.12-16 Emerging data suggest that Ig class -switched subtype (IgM -\nnegative) may be categorized as a clonal chronic lymphoproliferative \ndisorder due to its indolent disease course.15,17  \nGEP studies have shown that PCFCL is characterized by a germinal \ncenter B -cell (GCB) phenotype and PCDLBCL, leg type is most commonly \ncharacterized by activated B -cell (ABC) phenotype.11,18 Thus, a germinal PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-4 (or follicle) center phenotype and large cells in a skin lesion is consistent \nwith PCFCL.18 In nodal DLBCL, the GCB phenotype is associated with a \nbetter prognosis than the ABC phenotype. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and GEP -based algorithms used to classify nodal DLBCL into GCB or \nnon-GCB subtypes based on cell of origin (COO) have also shown to be \nuseful to distinguish PCFCL from PCDLBCL, leg type.\n19-21 However, these \nalgorithms may be of limited utility in the differentiation of PC- DLBCL, leg \ntype and PCFCL- LC.21 While all cases of PCFCL- LC were uniformly \nclassified as GCB phenotype by both IHC and GEP -based algorithms, the \nclassification based on COO was heterogenous in patients with PC-DLBCL, leg type.\n21 \nA high prevalence of gain- of-function mutations in MYD88 (MYD88  L265P) \nand CD79B  genes have been reported in patients with PCDLBCL, leg type \nand are associated with inferior clinical outcomes.11,19,22 GEP studies have \nalso identified that PCDLBCL belongs to MCD subtype (co- occurrence of \nMYD88  and CD79B  gain- of function mutations), which is associated with \nABC phenotype.11 In the aforementioned report that evaluated the \nclinicopathologic and molecular characteristics of patients with PCFCL (25 patients) and PCDLBCL, leg type (32 patients), MYD88  L265P mutation \nwas detected only in patients with PCDLBCL, leg type (n = 22; 69%).\n19 In \na retrospective analysis of 61 patients (58 patients with interpretable \nresults)  diagnosed with PCDLBCL, leg type, MYD88  L265P mutation was \ndetected in 59% of patients.22 It was also associated with shorter \ndisease- specific survival and was an independent adverse prognostic \nfactor for OS. The 3 -year and 5 -year disease- specific survival rates for \nthose with MYD88  L265P mutation were 66% and 60%, respectively, \ncompared to 85% and 72%, respectively, for patients with the wild- type \nallele.  \nThese findings suggest next -generation sequencing (NGS) for MYD88  and \nCD79B  mutations could be helpful to further distinguish PCDLBCL, leg type from PCFCL. IgM expression should be checked if MYD88 mutations \nare identified since IgM -positivity is likely associated with systemic \ninvolvement.  \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Primary \nCutaneous Lymphomas, a literature search was performed to obtain key \nliterature on PCBCL  published since the previous Guidelines update, \nusing the following search terms: cutaneous diffuse large B -cell \nlymphoma, cutaneous follicle center lymphoma, and cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma. The PubMed database was chosen as it remains the \nmost widely used resource for medical literature and indexes \npeer-reviewed biomedical literature.\n23  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. The data from key PubMed articles deemed as \nrelevant to these guidelines have been included in this version of the \nDiscussion section. Recommendations for which high -level evidence is \nlacking are based on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and \nexpe rt opinion.  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org .  \nDiagnosis  \nPCMZL are negative for BCL6 and CD10, but are often positive for CD20 and BCL2.\n24 PCFCL is consistently BCL6 -positive, whereas CD10 and \nBCL2 are expressed in only a few cases with a follicular growth pattern and the detection of BCL2 rearrangement is generally associated with \nextracutaneous spread.\n25-28  \nPCDLBCL, leg type tumors express CD20, IRF4/MUM1, FOXP1, and BCL2; many cases express BCL6 and lack expression of CD10.\n6,18,19,29- 31 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-5 PCDLBCL, leg type also has a high incidence of MYC rearrangements \nand MYC  rearrangements are not detected in PCFCL.32 In addition, \nPCFCL is usually IRF4/MUM1 -negative while PCDLBCL, leg type is \nusually IRF4/MUM1 -positive and shows strong expression of FOXP1.30,31 \nAssessment of FOXP1 expression is helpful to distinguish PCDLBCL, leg \ntype from PCFCL since all cases of PCFCL are FOXP1- negative.31 \nGEP- based algorithms and modified Hans IHC algorithm including CD10 \nand MUM1 have been shown to be useful to distinguish PCFCL from \nPCDLBCL, leg type with optimal diagnostic value without the need for \nBCL-6.19,20  \nThe diagnosis of PCBCL is established by adequate biopsy of skin \nlesions. Multiple biopsies may be necessary to capture the pathologic \nvariability of disease at diagnosis. Incisional, excisional, or punch biopsy is \npreferred to shave biopsy, as PCBCL have primarily dermal infiltrates, \noften deep, which are less well -sampled and can be missed by a shave \nbiopsy. Review of the slides by a pathologist with expertise in the diagnosis of PCBCL is recommended. Adequate immunophenotyping of \nthe biopsy sample is ess ential for the diagnosis of the exact subtype of \nPCBCL. In addition, immunophenotyping is also useful to rule out cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia (also known as pseudolymphoma or \nlymphocytoma cutis)\n33-35 and in the differential diagnosis of intravascular \nlarge B -cell lymphoma, which often manifests in skin and is associated \nwith a poor prognosis.36  \nThe initial IHC panel should include CD20, CD3, CD5, CD10, BCL2, \nBCL6, and IRF4/MUM1. Under certain circumstances, evaluation of \nadditional IHC markers such as Ki -67, CD43, CD21, CD23, cyclin D1, and \nkappa/lambda as well as MYC (IHC or in situ hybridization [ISH]) may be useful to further establish the lymphoma subtype. Additionally, \nassessment of surface IgM, IgD,  and FOXP1 expression may also be \nhelpful in distinguishing PCDLBCL, leg type from PCFCL.\n30,31,37 Epstein- Barr virus (EBV) -positive mucocutaneous ulcer is also included as \na new provisional entity in the updated WHO -EORTC classification and \nEpstein- Barr virus -encoded RNA in situ hybridization  (EBER -ISH) may be \nuseful under selected circumstances.4  \nThe t(14;18) translocation on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis has been observed only in a small number of cases with PCFCL, \nand the detection of a t(14;18) translocation suggests the presence of \nsystemic follicular lymphoma (FL).\n27,38 Cytogenetics or FISH to detect \nt(14;18) and FISH to detect BCL2  and BCL6  rearrangements if MYC is \npositive may be useful if systemic FL is suspected. The feasibility of flow \ncytometric immunophenotyping of skin biopsies for the assessment of \nB-cell clonality has been reported, although it has not been widely used.35 \nIf adequate biopsy material is available, molecular analysis to detect Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement or flow cytometry could be useful to \ndetermine B -cell clonality.  \nMantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is not a cutaneous lymphoma and finding it in the skin requires a careful search for extracutaneous disease. Clinical \npresentation on the leg and blastoid cytology along with high proliferative \nindex and expression of BCL2, IRF4/ MUM1, and IgM would often \nrepresent MCL with skin involvement.\n39 The use of cyclin D1 may be \nuseful to differentiate PCMZL (negative for CD5 and cyclin D1) from MCL \n(positive for CD5 and cyclin D1).  \nWorkup  \nThe absence of extracutaneous disease at diagnosis is part of the definition of PCBCL. The initial workup is geared toward evaluating extent \nof disease on the skin and seeking extracutaneous disease.\n40 \nThe initial workup should include a complete physical examination, a \ncomprehensive skin examination, complete blood count (CBC) with \ndifferential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and CT and/or PET/CT of the PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

Peripheral blood flow cytometry will be useful \nin selected cases, if CBC demonstrates lymphocytosis. Imaging is \neffective in identifying systemic involvement in patients with indolent \nCBCL.41 However, it can be omitted if clinically indicated in patients with \nlow-grade indolent PCBCL.42 PET/CT may have higher sensitivity in the \ndetection of both local and distant metastases than CT.43 However, this is \nnot validated and the higher rates of false -positive findings can create \nconfusion.  \nBone marrow biopsy is essential for PCDLBCL, leg type, since this is an \naggressive lymphoma that will probably require systemic treatment; \nhowever, it appears to have a more limited value in PCFCL and PCMZL, \nand may be considered only in selected patients (eg, for patients with \nunexplained cytopenias or if there is clinical suspicion of more aggressive subtypes).\n40,42,44 Senff et al evaluated 275 patients with histologic features \nconsistent with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL; n = 82) or follicle center lymphoma (FCL; n = 193) first presenting in the skin.\n44 Bone marrow \ninvolvement was seen in approximately 11% of patients in the FCL group compared with 2% in the MZL group. Among patients with FCL, a positive \nbone marrow was associated with significantly worse prognosis compared \nwith those with skin lesions only; the 5- year OS rate was 44% and 84%, \nrespectively.\n44  \nThe International Society of Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and the EORTC Task Force recommend that bone marrow biopsy be obtained for \ncutaneous lymphomas with intermediate to aggressive behaviors and \nshould be considered for cutaneous lymphomas with indolent behavior \nand when there is any evidence of extracutaneous disease, as indicated \nby other staging assessments (eg, radiographic evidence or serologic \nclues such as elevated monoclonal or polyclonal Ig).\n40 The NCCN Guidelines recommend considering bone marrow biopsy for patients with unexplained cytopenias or if there is clinical suspicion of \nPCDLBCL, leg type.  \nTreatment Options  \nInvolved -site radiation therapy (ISRT) is very effective when used as \ninitial therapy as well as for cutaneous relapses in most patients with \nindolent PCBCL.\n45-49    \nIn a retrospective study of 34 patients with PCBCL treated with RT, \n5-year relapse -free survival (RFS) rates ranged from 62% to 73% for \nPCFCL and PCMZL but were only 33% for patients with PCDLBCL, leg \ntype.46 The 5 -year OS rate was 100% for PCFCL and PCMZL but was \n67% for PCDLBCL, leg type. Senff et al evaluated the outcome of 153 patients with PCBCL (25 with PCMZL; 101 with PCFCL; and 27 with \nPCDLBCL) who were initially treated with RT with a curative intent.\n47 \nOverall, 45% of patients had single lesions while localized or \ndisseminated lesions were seen in 43% and 12% of patients, \nrespectively. Complete response (CR) was obtained in 151 of 153 \npatients (99%). Relapse rates for PCMZL, PCFCL, and PCDLBCL, leg \ntype were 60%, 29%, and 64%, and the 5- year disease -specific survival \nrates were 95%, 97%, and 59%, respectively. The PCFCLs presenting on the legs also had a higher relapse rate (63%) and a lower 5- year \ndisease -specific survival (44%) compared with PCFCLs occ urring at \nother sites (25% and 99%, respectively).\n47  \nIn another retrospective study of 42 patients with biopsy -proven PCFCL \nand PCMZL, RT resulted in CR in all patients.49 The 10- year RFS and \nOS rates were 71% and 87%, respectively, for the entire cohort, after a \nmedian follow -up of 9.5 years.

Relapse rate did not vary by the type of initial \ntherapy. In patients with PCDLBCL, leg type, the CR rate and 5 - and \n10-year OS rates were 82%, 73%, and 47%, respectively. PCDLBCL, leg \ntype was associated with higher relapse rates (55%) and higher \nincidences of extracutaneous spread (17%) —a higher relapse rate was \nconfirmed both for patients with single or regional lesions treated with RT \nand for patients with disseminated cutaneous involvement treated with \nchemotherapy.5 In a retrospective analysis of 137 patients with PCMZL, \ninitial treatment with surgical excision, RT, or a combination of both \nresulted in a CR rate of 88% (93% for patients with solitary or localized \ndisease and 71% for those with multifocal lesions).55 Although there were \nno significant differences in the rate of recurrences between the treatment modalities, surgery alone was associated with more recurrences at the \ninitial site.  \nRituximab monotherapy (intravenous57-62 and intralesional63-65) has been \nshown to be effective for PCMZL and PCFCL. Intravenous rituximab may \nbe more effective for patients with multiple lesions that cannot be \nmanaged effectively with local therapy.57-61 In a retrospective analysis of \n15 patients with indolent PCBCL, rituximab resulted in an overall response \nrate (ORR) of 87% (60% CR). The ORR was 100% for patients with \nPCFCL and 60% for patients with PCMZL. With a median follow -up of 36 \nmonths, the median duration of response was 24 months.60 In another \nseries of 16 patients with PCBCL, 14 patients (88%) achieved a CR with \nrituximab monotherapy; 35% of these patients with CR eventually relapsed \nbetween 6 and 37 months.61 In an observational multicenter study \nconducted by the Spanish Working Group on Cutaneous Lymphoma (17 \npatients with PCMZL and 18 patients with PCFCL), intralesional rituximab \ninduced CR and partial response (PR) in 71% and 23% of patients, \nrespectively, with a median DFS of 114 weeks.63 The response rates were \nsimilar among patients with PCMZL and PCFCL. In a small series that \nevaluated the efficacy of intravenous and intralesional rituximab in \ntreatment of patients with PCMZL and PCFCL, although intralesional \nrituximab resulted in response rates similar to that of intravenous \nrituximab, within a 12 -month follow -up period, relapses were more \nfrequent among patients treated with intralesional rituximab.66   \nIn a real -world multicenter, retrospective study of 235 patients with CBCL \n(PCMZL, n = 123; PCFCL, n = 96; PCDLBCL, leg type, n = 16), the 5- year \nPFS rates were 67% and 59% for patients with PCMZL and PCFCL, respectively.\n62 Surgical excision (36%) and RT (27%) were the most \ncommon initial treatment options. Systemic rituximab,  \nchemoimmunotherapy, and topical or intralesional steroids were \nadministered in 13%, 8%, and 7%, of patients, respectively.

Treatment with RT and topical or intralesional steroids was \nassociated with longer median time to next  treatment (445 days and 359 \ndays, respectively) compared to surgical excision (154 days).  \nSeveral case reports have shown the effectiveness of skin- directed \ntherapy (steroids, imiquimod, and nitrogen mustard or bexarotene gel) for \npatients with multifocal lesions.67-71 Interlesional steroids have also been \nused in the management of PCFCL or PCMZL, although only limited data \nare available.53,62,72,73 Systemic therapy (rituximab monotherapy or \ncombination chemoimmunotherapy) is often more appropriate for those with generalized disease (skin only; T3) in patients with PCFCL or \nPCMZL.\n57-61,67,74 -76 \nBecause there are no data from randomized clinical trials, the treatment recommendations included in the NCCN Guidelines are derived from the \nmanagement practices of patients with PCBCL at NCCN Member \nInstitutions based on the limited data from retrospecti ve analyses and \nstudies involving a small cohort of patients.  \nPrimary Cutaneous Marginal Zone Lymphoma and Primary \nCutaneous Follicle Center Cell Lymphoma  \nWhile PCMZL and PCFCL respond to initial therapy, disease relapse is \ncommon in the majority of patients with regional or generalized disease, \nregardless of type of initial treatment. However, relapses are generally \nconfined to the skin in which case surviv al does not appear to be affected. \nIn a retrospective analysis that assessed the efficacy of various treatment modalities (55 patients; majority of patients had indolent PCBCL; 25 \npatients with PCMZL and 24 patients with PCFCL), the type of treatment \nmodal ity (skin -directed vs. definitive RT with or without systemic therapy) \ndid not affect the time to first recurrence among patients with T1 and \nT2/T3 lesions.\n77 The rates of recurrence were higher for T2/T3 lesions compared to T1 lesions (58% and 31%, respectively). The time to first \nrecurrence for T1 lesions was 33% and 29%, respectively, for patients with \nPCMZL and PCFCL; however, the difference was not significant. Among \npatients with T2/T3 lesions, there was a non -significant trend toward \nhigher rate of recurrence for PCMZL than PCFCL (73% and 38%, respectively).  \nAdditional imaging studies during the course of treatment are not needed \nafter negative initial staging for systemic involvement, and clinical \nfollow- up without routine imaging may be appropriate for patients with \nPCMZL.\n41 PET/CT (preferred) or CT with contrast may be repeated at the \nend of treatment for assessment of response and can be repeated if there \nis clinical suspicion of progressive disease.  \nSolitary or Regional Lesions (T1 –T2)  \nLocal ISRT (24– 30 Gy) is a preferred initial treatment option. Excision or \nskin-directed therapy or intralesional steroids may be used for selected \npatients. Observation is an option when RT or excision is neither desired nor feasible (eg, lesions on the s calp where hair loss is a major concern).  \nObservation is also recommended for patients with disease responding to \ninitial therapy, and those with refractory disease should be treated as \ndescribed for generalized disease below.  \nLow-dose RT (4 Gy) may be adequate for relapsed or refractory \ndisease.\n50-52 Patients with regional relapse should be treated with an \nalternate initial treatment option and those with generalized disease \nrelapse confined to the skin should receive treatment options \nrecommended for generalized disease at presentation.  \nPatients with extracutaneous relapse or those with cutaneous relapse that \nis not responding to any of the initial treatment options should be treated PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-9 according to the FL or nodal MZL as outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for \nB-Cell Lymphomas.  \nGeneralized Disease (skin only; T3)  \nSkin-directed therapy, local ISRT (24– 30 Gy) for palliation of symptoms, \nintralesional steroids, or rituximab are included as options for initial \ntreatment. Observation is appropriate in asymptomatic patients. In patients \nwith very extensive or symptomatic  disease, other combination \nchemotherapy regimens recommended for FL or nodal MZL may be \nused.74-76 \nObservation is recommended for patients with disease responding to initial \ntherapy, and those with refractory disease should be treated with an \nalternate initial treatment option.  \nPatients with relapse localized to skin should be treated with an alternate \ninitial treatment option. Patients with extracutaneous relapse or those with \ncutaneous relapse that is not responding to any of the initial treatment \noptions should be treated as described for extracutaneous disease.  \nExtracutaneous Disease  \nExtracutaneous disease should be managed according to FL or nodal \nMZL as outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for B -Cell Lymphomas.74-76 \nPrimary Cutaneous Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma, Leg Type  \nRT alone is less effective in patients with PCDLBCL, leg type. While these lesions do respond to RT, remissions are often short -lived and higher \nrates of dissemination to extracutaneous sites may occur.  \nThe potential utility of chemoimmunotherapy for the treatment of \nPCDLBCL, leg type has been described only in retrospective analyses and \ncase reports.\n78-83 In a retrospective multicenter study from the French \nStudy Group on 60 patients with PCDLBCL, leg type, patients treated with anthracycline- based chemoimmunotherapy had a more favorable \nshort -term outcome, although no particular therapy (RT or multiagent \nchemotherapy with or without rituximab) was significantly associated with \nimproved survival outcomes.78 Among 12 patients treated with \nanthracycline- based chemoimmunotherapy, the CR rate was 92% \ncompared to 62% for patients who received other therapies. The 2- year \nOS rate for these two groups was 81% and 59%, respectively.  \nMultiagent chemoimmunotherapy regimens have been associated with \nexcellent outcomes.81-83 In a report from the French Study Group (115 \npatients), the 3-  and 5 -year survival rates were 80% and 74%, \nrespectively, for patients who received multiagent chemoimmunotherapy \ncompared to 48% and 38%, respectively, for patients who received \nless-intensiv e therapies.81 In a more recent retrospective analysis \ninvolving 28 patients with PCDLBCL, leg type treated in a single center, \nR-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and \nprednisone) with ISRT resulted in significantly longer median PFS compared t o R-CHOP without ISRT as front -line therapy (58 vs. 14 \nmonths; P = .04).\n83  \nPCDLBCL, leg type has a poorer prognosis than other types of PCBCL and is generally treated with more aggressive chemoimmunotherapy \nregimens used for systemic DLBCL as outlined in the NCCN Guidelines \nfor B -Cell Lymphomas.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-16  \n \nMycosis Fungoides and Sézary Syndrome  \nOverview  \nCutaneous T -cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a group of non -Hodgkin \nlymphomas (NHL) that primarily present in the skin, and at times \nprogress to involve lymph nodes, blood, and visceral organs.1-3 Mycosis \nfungoides (MF) is the most common subtype and is usually associated \nwith an indolent clinical course with intermittent, stable, or slow \nprogression of the lesions.4,5  \nExtracutaneous involvement (lymph nodes, blood, or less commonly \nother organs) or large cell transformation (LCT) may be seen in \nadvanced- stage disease. Sézary syndrome (SS) is a rare erythrodermic, \nleukemic variant characterized by significant blood involvement, \nerythroderma, and often lymphadenopathy .4,6,7 MF is caused by the \nmalignant transformation of skin- resident effector memory T cells while SS \nis thought to arise from thymic memory T cells, supporting the contention \nthat SS is a process distinct from MF.6 Cases presenting as an overlap of \nthese two conditions also exist.  \nFolliculotropic MF (FMF), hypopigmented MF, granulomatous slack skin, \nand pagetoid reticulosis are recognized as distinct clinicopathologic \nvariants of MF in the World Health Organization- European Organization \nfor Research and Treatment of Cancer (WHO -EORT C) classification.2 \nFMF and LCT are histologic features that can occur irrespective of stage,  \nbut the incidence of LCT is higher in patients with advanced- stage \ndisease.8-10 Expert dermatopathology and/or hematopathology review is \nneeded to confirm the diagnosis. This is especially true for the less \ncommon variants of the disease, which can be difficult to distinguish from other lymphoproliferative disorders. Genomic studies have demonstrated \nfurther biologic diversity within MF.4,11  \nDue to the rarity and diversity of the condition and the need for an \nindividualized approach, the NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends that \npatients diagnosed with MF and SS be treated at specialized centers with \nexpertise in the management of this disease.12 \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines \nin Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Primary Cutaneous Lymphomas, an \nelectronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key \nliterature on MF and SS published since the previous Guidelines update \nusing the following search terms: cutaneous T- cell lymphomas, mycosis \nfungoides, and Sézary syndrome. The PubMed database was chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes \npeer-reviewed bi omedical literature.\n13  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Randomized Controlled Trial; Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase \nIII; Guideline; Meta Analysis; Systemat ic Reviews; and Validation Studies. \nThe data from key PubMed articles deemed as relevant to these guidelines have been included in this version of the Discussion section. \nRecommendations for which high- level evidence is lacking are based on \nthe Panel’s rev iew of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org .  \nStaging  \nThe T (skin), N (node), M (visceral), and B (blood involvement) classification and clinical staging developed by the International Society This discussion corresponds to the NCCN Guidelines for Primary Cutaneous  \nLymphomas .

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-17 for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL) and EORTC are outlined on MFSS- 3 \nand MFSS- 4.14  \nThe extent of skin involvement is based on the percentage of body surface \narea (BSA) where the patient’s palm (without digits) is equivalent to 0.5% \nBSA and the palm with all five digits is approximately 1% BSA. In the \nrevised staging system, T1 disease (l imited skin involvement) is defined as \npatches, papules, and/or plaques covering <10% BSA. T2 (skin- only \ndisease) is defined as patches, papules, and/or plaques covering ≥10% \nBSA. Patch diagnosis is noted as T1a or T2a and plaque diagnosis is noted as T1b or T2b. T3 (tumor -stage disease) is defined by the presence \nof one or more tumors (≥1 cm in diameter with nodular quality). T4 (erythrodermic disease) is defined as confluence of erythema covering \n≥80% BSA. However, this criterion of 80% is subjective and the BSA can \nfluctuate in patients with erythrodermic MF or SS. Thus, other features including keratoderma, ectropion, or leg edema should also be evaluated \nin patients with erythrodermic MF or SS.  \nLymph node biopsy for staging is recommended only for clinically \nabnormal nodes (>1.5 cm in longest diameter). Lymphadenopathy can be \nclinically reactive or dermatopathic; thus, not all enlarged lymph nodes are \nsampled. The designation “Nx” may be used for  abnormal lymph nodes \nwithout histologic evaluation. The designation “Mx” can be used for presence of abnormal visceral sites without histologic evaluation. Visceral \ndisease with the involvement of an organ (eg, spleen, liver) other than the \nskin, nodes, o r blood should be documented using imaging studies.  \nBlood involvement is classified into three groups: B0, B1, and B2 based on \nthe number of immunophenotypically abnormal T cells in the blood \n(MFSS- 3). Patients with lymphopenia (defined as <1000 absolute \nlymphocytes) may potentially have an underestimation of aberrant lymphocyte burden if assessed only by the absolute number and not also \nby the percentage of immunophenotypically abnormal lymphocytes.\n14 B1 or B2 is best characterized by both flow cytometry and the presence of \nclonally related neoplastic T cells as in the skin by TCR gene \nrearrangement analysis. A diagnosis of SS requires B2 level of blood involvement.  \nPrognosis  \nAge at presentation, overall stage, extent and type of skin involvement (T classification), presence of extracutaneous disease, extent of peripheral \nblood involvement (as defined by flow cytometric measurements of Sézary \ncell counts), elevated lactate dehy drogenase (LDH), and presence of LCT \nhave been identified as the most significant factors for disease \nprogression and/or survival in patients with MF.\n15-21 In a retrospective \ncohort study of 525 patients with MF or SS, patient age, T classification, \nand presence of extracutaneous disease retained independent prognostic \nvalue in a multivariate analysis.16 The risk of disease progression, \ndevelopment of extracutaneous disease, or death due to MF correlated \nwith initial T classification. Limited patch or plaque disease has an \nexcellent prognosis compared to patients with widespread plaque- type or \ntumor -type skin disease or erythrodermic skin involvement, and \nextracutaneous disease is associated with a poor prognosis.18,19  \nLCT is also an independent prognostic factor of shorter overall survival \n(OS) in patients with SS. In an analysis of 117 patients with SS, LCT was \npresent in 6% of patients at the time of diagnosis and the median OS \nwas 35 months for those with LCT compare d to 80 months for those \nwithout LCT.22 The presence of ulceration, decreased levels of CD8+ \ncells in peripheral blood, maximum total BSA, and peak LDH were \npredictors for LCT in patients with SS.23  \nIn the Cutaneous Lymphoma International Consortium (CLIC) study that evaluated the relevance of prognostic markers on OS in 1275 patients with \nadvanced- stage MF and SS, stage IV disease, aged 60 years, LCT and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-18 LDH levels were identified as independent prognostic markers that could \nbe used together in a prognostic model to identify three risk groups with \nsignificantly different survival outcomes.21 The 5 -year survival rates were \n68%, 44%, and 28%, respectively, for low -risk, intermediate -risk, and \nhigh- risk groups.  A prospective international study by CLIC (Prospective \nCutaneous Lymphoma International Prognostic Index [PROCLIPI] international study) is underway to identify any new prognostic markers \nand validate the refined prognostic index model to optimize the \nrisk-stratified approach for the treatment of patients with MF or SS.\n24-26   \nDiagnosis  \nBiopsy of suspicious skin sites along with immunohistochemistry (IHC) of \nbiopsy specimen are essential to confirm the diagnosis. Biopsy of \nenlarged lymph nodes (ie, palpable nodes >1.5 cm in diameter and/or firm, \nirregular, clustered, or fixed nodes) or ex tracutaneous sites is \nrecommended. Excisional or incisional biopsy is preferred over core needle biopsy. Fine- needle aspiration (FNA) alone is not sufficient for the \ninitial diagnosis. Bone marrow biopsy is not required for disease staging but may be helpf ul in those with an unexplained hematologic abnormality.  \nMF and SS cells are typically characterized by the following immunophenotype: CD2+, CD3+, CD5+, CD4+, CD8- , CCR4+, \nTCR- beta+, and CD45RO+ and they lack certain T- cell markers, CD7 and \nCD26.\n27 However, there are variants of MF that are CD8+ (especially the \nhypopigmented variant) or CD4/CD8 dual negative (in those with LCT and hypopigmented variant), although rare.\n28-30 The IHC panel of skin biopsy \nshould include CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD20, and CD30.  \nAdditional immunohistochemical markers such as CD25, CD56, TIA1, \ngranzyme B, TCR beta, and TCR delta may be useful in selected \ncircumstances. The loss of CCR4 expression and emergence of CCR4 \ngenomic alterations might be associated with resistance to mogamulizumab.31 IHC for CCR4 may be useful to confirm resistance to \nmogamulizumab in patients with progressive or refractory disease while on \ntreatment with mogamulizumab.   \nPrimary cutaneous follicular helper T- cell (TFH) lymphoma is a recently \ndescribed variant of peripheral T -cell lymphoma (PTCL) -not otherwise \nspecified. This variant usually presents as a sudden onset of multiple \nplaques and nodules characterized by the expression TFH markers such \nas CXCL13, ICOS, and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1).32,33 \nIdentification of these markers along with other clinical and histopathologic features would be useful to distinguish MFSS from CTCL \nof TFH origin.\n34,35  \nMolecular analysis to detect clonal TCR gene rearrangements is useful \nto support the diagnosis of MF and SS as well as to distinguish MF from \ninflammatory dermatoses, especially if identical clones are demonstrated \nin more than one skin site.36,37 However, results showing clonal TCR \ngene rearrangements should not be interpreted as the sole and defining test for malignancy since clonal TCR rearrangements can at times be \nseen in non- malignant conditions or may not be demonstrated in all \ncases of MF and SS. TCR rearrangement analysis by high throughput \nsequencing (or next -generation sequencing) is a more sensitive and \nspecific test of clonality that can identify the clones by the genetic \nsequence of the TCR.\n38,39 Demonstration of identical clones in the skin, \nblood, and/or lymph nodes may be helpful both for diagnosis and \ndifferentiating MF and SS from benign inflammatory skin diseases.   \nAssessment of peripheral blood involvement optimally by  flow cytometry \nis important for staging and is also useful to differentiate CTCL with \nperipheral blood involvement from other forms of leukemic T -cell \nlymphomas (eg, T- cell prolymphocytic leukemia, lymphocytic variant of \nhypereosinophilic syndrome, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma [ATLL]). \nFlow cytometry allows for the assessment and quantitation of an PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

Analysis of clonal TCR gene \narrangement of peripheral blood lymphocytes is recommended if blood involvement is suspected.  \nCT with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis or integrated \nwhole -body PET/CT scan is recommended for patients with T3 or T4 \ndisease and should be considered for patients with T2a (patch disease with ≥10% BSA), T2b (widespread plaque- type skin disease), FMF or \nLCT, palpable adenopathy, or abnormal laboratory studies. In an analysis of 375 patients with stage T1/T2 MF enrolled in the PROCLIPI \ninternational study, the presence of plaques was associated wi th a \nsignificant increase in the identification of  radiologically enlarged or \ninvolved lymph nodes in patients with early -stage MF.\n25  A CT scan of the neck may be useful in some circumstances. Integrated \nPET/CT was found to be more sensitive for the detection of lymph node \ninvolvement than CT alone and can help direct biopsies.44 PET scan may \nalso be preferred in patients with extranodal disease that may be inadequately imaged by CT. Many skin- directed and systemic therapies \nare contraindicated or are of unknown safety in pregnancy. Therefore, \npregnancy testing is recommended for individuals of childbearing age.  \nTreatment Considerations  \nWhile MF and SS are treatable, they are not curable with conventional \nsystemic therapy and the symptoms of the disease have significant \nimpact on the quality of life. Patients with MF, particularly those with \nearly -stage disease, can have very good prognos is and may live with the \ndisease for decades.\n18,19  \nThe optimal treatment for any patient at any given time should be individualized based on overall goals of therapy (improve the disease \nburden and quality of life, attain adequate response to reduce/control \nsymptoms, and minimize the risk of progression), route of administration, \nand toxicity profile. Discussions regarding cumulative toxicity of therapy, \nimpact of therapy on quality of life, and supportive care for symptom \ncontrol are a key part of the treatment of patients with MF and SS. Most \nof the treat ment options do not result in durable remissions and are often \ngiven in an ongoing or maintenance fashion to achieve disease control with as little impact on quality of life as possible.  \nPatients with a clinical benefit and/or those with disease responding to \nprimary treatment can be considered for maintenance or tapering of \nregimens to optimize response duration. Patients with disease that does \nnot have adequate response to a systemic therapy regimen are generally \ntreated with an alternative regimen recommended for primary treatment \nbefore moving on to treatment for refractory disease. This supports the \ntherapeutic principle of initial treatment with less toxic regimens before PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

Disease relapse (with the same \nstage) after discontinuation of therapy often responds well to retreatment \nwith previous therapy.  \nSelection of Therapy Based on Clinical and Pathologic Features  \nSkin-directed therapies (topical therapy, phototherapy, radiation therapy \n[RT], or total skin electronic beam therapy [ TSEBT]) that can provide \ndisease control without major cumulative toxicities are recommended for patients with early -stage disease and limited skin involvement (stage IA or \nstage IB –IIA). Stage IA MF most often can be treated with skin- directed \ntherapies ( alone or in combination with other skin -directed therapies). \nWhile stage IB –IIA patch/plaque disease can be effectively treated \npredominantly with skin -directed therapies, systemic therapy can be \nconsidered for stage IB –IIA with higher skin disease burden, concerning \npathologic features (eg, LCT or FMF) ,\n predominantly plaque disease, \nand/or inadequate response to skin- directed therapy.  \nSystemic therapy is recommended for advanced- stage disease (≥ stage \nIIB). However, patients with stage IIB disease with single or few T3 lesions \ncan be treated with external beam RT (EBRT) with further delay of \nsystemic therapy and TSEBT may be used for pa tients with stage IB –IIB \ndisease, with excellent response expected. In the PROCLIPI study, the use of systemic therapy was significantly associated with higher clinical \nstage, presence of plaques, and FMF.\n26 In a multivariate analysis, the \npresence of plaques and FMF were significantly associated with the use of systemic therapy, and skin- directed therapy was superior to systemic \ntherapy even in patients with these disease characteristics. The overall \nrespons e rate (ORR) to first -line skin -directed therapy was 73% compared \nto 57% for systemic therapy.  Systemic therapy can be and often is combined with skin -directed \ntherapy to maximize clinical responses in the skin compartment and also \nto provide additive efficacy without cumulative toxicities. For those who \nrequire systemic therapy, due to either advanced -stage disease or \ninadequate disease control on skin -directed therapy, there are many \noptions; however, given the rare nature of this disease, only a few have \nbeen evaluated in randomized studies, as discussed in the section \nSystemic Therapies . Therefor e, a clinical trial should be considered \nwhen appropriate and available.  \nData from clinical trials that have evaluated various treatment strategies \n(skin -directed therapy, systemic therapy, and combination therapies) are \ndiscussed below.  \nSkin -Directed Therapies  \nTopical therapy with corticosteroids, mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard), \ntopical retinoids or topical imiquimod, or RT are indicated for patients with \nlocalized disease. Phototherapy and TSEBT are indicated for patients with \nwidespread skin involvement. Topical retinoids are not recommended for \ngeneralized skin involvement because these treatments can cause \nsubstantial irritation.  \nTopical Corticosteroids  \nTopical corticosteroids are effective for early -stage MF (especially for the \ntreatment of patch -stage MF), resulting in measurable improvement in \nBSA involvement and high ORR of 94% (63% complete response [CR]; \n13% partial response [PR]) and 82% (25% CR; 57% PR) in patients with \nstage T1 and T2 disease, respectively.45-47  \nOptimal use of topical steroids is often dependent on lesion type and \ndisease site. This is best done in consultation with a dermatologist or \nphysician with experience in the use of topical steroids.

Long -term use of a topical steroid \nmay lead to skin atrophy or striae formation and the risk becomes greater \nwith increased potency of the steroid. Moreover, high- potency steroids \nused on large skin surfaces may lead to systemic absorption.  \nTopical Mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard)  \nTopical mechlorethamine has been used for the management of MF for many decades resulting in an ORR of 83% (50% CR). Patients with T1 \ndisease had a higher ORR (93% vs. 72%), CR rate (65% vs. 34%), longer \nmedian OS (21 vs. 15 months), and higher 5- year OS r ate (97% vs. 72%) \nthan those with T2 disease.\n48 The efficacy was similar for aqueous and \nointment preparations, although the ointment was associated with reduced \nhypersensitivity reactions.   \nA topical gel formulation of mechlorethamine was approved by the U.S. \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 based on the results of a \nmulticenter, randomized, phase II trial that demonstrated the non -inferiority \nof topical gel formulation compared to the compounded ointment formulation for the treatment of stage IA or IIA MF in patients (n = 260) \nwho had not been treated with topical mechlorethamine within 2 years of \nstudy enrollment and had not received prior therapy with topical \nmechlorethamine.\n49 Response rate based on Composite Assessment of \nIndex Lesion Severity was 59% for the topical gel formulation compared to \n48% for the ointment formulation. No study treatment -related serious \nadverse events were reported, and no systemic absorption was dete cted.  \nTopical mechlorethamine has no significant systemic absorption, and can be used alone or in combination with other skin directed therapies, in \nparticular topical steroids. The use of topical gel formulation of \nmechlorethamine can be complicated by dermatit is and can result in skin \nirritation when used on the face and intertriginous body areas. Initiation at \nless than daily use can be useful to determine tolerability. Topical steroids \ncan be considered as needed to alleviate skin reactions from topical gel formulation. If used in combination with phototherapy, topical \nmechlorethamine gel should be applied after exposure to ultraviolet light. \nTopical mechlorethamine is prohibited in the genital skin.  \nTopical Retinoids  \nBexarotene gel is the only FDA -approved synthetic topical retinoid for the \ntreatment of MF and SS. In the phase I –II trial of 67 patients with \nearly -stage MF, the ORR was 63% (21% CR) and the estimated median \nresponse duration was 99 weeks.50 Response rates were higher among \nthe patients who had had no prior therapy compared with those who had \nreceived prior topical therapies (75% vs. 67%). In the phase III multicenter \nstudy of 50 patients with early -stage refractory MF, the ORR was 44% (8% \nCR).51  \nTazarotene 0.1% topical gel/cream was reported to be a well -tolerated and \nactive adjuvant therapy by clinical and histologic assessments in a small \nseries of patients with early patch or plaque MF lesions (stable or \nrefractory to therapy).52,53  \nTopical Imiquimod  \nImiquimod has also demonstrated activity in a small number of patients \nwith early -stage MF refractory to other therapies.54-57 Topical imiquimod \ncan be considered (often in consultation with a dermatologist or physician \nwith experience in its safety and use) for areas with few \npatches/plaques/small tumors that are recalcitrant to treatment or on \nsun-damaged skin such as forearms,  scalp, and face.  \nTopical Carmustine  \nTopical carmustine is an effective treatment for patch/plaque early -stage \nMF resulting in high response rates of 92% and 64% in patients with T1 \nand T2 disease, respectively, at 36 months.58,59 Topical carmustine is \nincluded with a category 2B recommendation.

In a large series of 58 \npatients treated with 8 Gy in a single fraction, the CR rate was 94% for \nindividual lesions after a median follow -up of 41 months.64  \nOptimal management of individual plaque and tumor lesions is with EBRT \n(8–12 Gy, 8 Gy may be given in a single- fraction; 24– 30 Gy is \nrecommended for more durable duration of response or for unilesional presentation).\n62,64,65  \nTotal Skin Electron Beam Therapy    \nTSEBT (conventional dose [30–36 Gy] or low dose [<30 Gy])  either alone \nor in combination with adjuvant therapy has been shown to be effective for the treatment of early -stage MF.\n66-69 TSEBT at a conventional dose of ≥30 \nGy was associated with a non- significant trend towards better clinical \nbenefit and was also associated with better outcomes in patients with T2 \ndisease compared to those with T3 disease.68,69 In a retrospective study that evaluated low- dose TSEBT in 102 patients with T2 to T4 disease \n(excluding those with extracutaneous disease), TSEBT doses of 10 Gy to <20 Gy and 20 Gy to <30 Gy resulted in ORRs of 98% and 97%, \nrespectively, which were comparable to the ORRs achieved with \nstandard -dose TSEBT (≥30 Gy).\n67 The OS and progression- free survival \n(PFS) rates were not significantly different by dose groups and were comparable to that of standard- dose TSEBT (≥30 Gy).  \nLower -dose TSEBT (10– 12 Gy over a period of 2 –3 weeks) is shown to be \nsufficiently active and may also be associated with fewer short -term \ncomplications and better ability to re- treat progressive disease (PD) or \ncutaneous relapses.70-75 A pooled analysis of three phase II clinical trials \nthat evaluated low- dose TSEBT (12 Gy;  1 Gy per fraction over 3 weeks) in \n33 patients with MF reported an ORR of 88% (including 9 patients with a CR).\n71 The median time to response and median duration of clinical \nbenefit were 8 weeks and 71 weeks. In a cohort of 103 patients with MF treated with low -dose TSEBT (12 Gy in 8 fractions for 2  weeks; the \nmajority of patients had stage IB or IIB disease), after a median follow -up \nof 21 months, the ORR was 87% (18% CR and 69% PR) and the median \nPFS was 13 months.\n74 The median PFS was significantly longer for \npatients with stage IB disease (27 months) compared to 11 months and 10 months, respectively, for those with stage IIB or stage III disease. \nLow-dose TSEBT (12 Gy in 6– 7 fractions) was also associated with \nfavor able outcomes and significantly fewer grade 2 acute toxicities \ncompared with conventional -dose TSEBT (30 Gy).\n73,76,77 Further studies \nare warranted to confirm these findings and the use of low -dose TSEBT in \ncombined modality regimens.  \nThe recommended dose range for TSEBT is 12 to 36 Gy (generally 4– 6 \nGy per week).

In these patients, TSEBT may be used \nwith lower doses and slower fractionation. Antibiotic therapy should be \nconsidered since patients with erythrodermi c disease are at increased risk \nof developing secondary infections.  \nPhototherapy  \nUltraviolet B (UVB including narrowband -UVB)80-84 and psoralen plus \nultraviolet A1 (PUVA/UVA -1)85-88 are effective treatment options for \npatients with early -stage MF. Narrowband UVB is the most common \nphototherapy approach and less skin damaging than PUVA/UVA -1. While \nsome retrospective studies have reported that PUVA results in better responses and improved disease -free survival (DFS),\n89-91 others have \nreported that UVB is as effective as PUVA for the treatment of early -stage MF.\n92,93 However, these modalities have not been compared \nin randomized clinical trials.  \nPUVA may be associated with a small increase in the risk of developing \nbasal cell carcinoma (BCC), while there was no significant association \nbetween the use of narrowband UVB and the risk of developing BCC, \nsquamous cell carcinoma (SCC), or melanoma.94 More recent reports also \nconfirmed that the use of UV radiation (including UVA and narrowband \nUVB) was not associated with an increased risk of developing BCC, SCC, \nor melanoma except in patients receiving immunosuppressive \ntherapy.95,96 It may be more beneficial to start with narrowband UVB than \nPUVA in patients with early patch- stage or thin- plaque disease, since \nnarrowband UVB has less skin toxicity than broadband UVB and \nPUVA.94,97,98  Phototherapy should be used with caution in patients with a history of immunosuppressive medication due to the increased risk of UV \nradiation- associated skin malignancies in this patient population. The risk \nand benefits of phototherapy should be considere d in patients with a \nhistory of BCC, SCC, or melanoma. There are limited safety data for the \nuse of phototherapy in combination with vorinostat or romidepsin. Patients \non long- term phototherapy should be carefully monitored for the \ndevelopment of actinic k eratoses, BCC, SCC, or melanoma. The general \nprinciples and dosing guidelines for phototherapy are outlined in the \nPrinciples of Phototherapy  section of the guidelines.  \nSystemic Therapies  \nThe selection of systemic therapy regimens is dependent on clinical (eg, extent of patch/plaques; disease burden profile in the skin, lymph nodes, \nand blood; prior therapies; and comorbidities) and pathologic features (eg, \nLCT or FMF) and IHC data (eg, CD30 positivity).\n99 In general, systemic \ntherapy regimens that can be tolerated for longer durations of therapy with \nlower rates of cumulative toxicity, less immunosuppression, and/or higher \nefficacy are used in earlier lines of therapy. Regimens with lower \nside-effect profi les and an absence of cumulative toxicity are often given in \nan ongoing or maintenance fashion to improve and maintain disease control and quality of life. In patients requiring chemotherapy, single \nagents are preferred over combination chemotherapy, due t o the higher \ntoxicity profiles associated with multiagent regimens and the short -lived \nresponses seen with time- limited combination chemotherapy.  \nBrentuximab vedotin, bexarotene, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (vorinostat and romidepsin), methotrexate, pralatrexate, mogamulizumab, alemtuzumab, and pembrolizumab are effective systemic therapy options \nfor patients with advanced MF and SS.

Multiagent \nchemotherapy regimens used for the treatment of systemic PTCLs have \nactivity but are associated with greater toxicity and a potentially higher risk \nof death when used in earlier lines of treatment.148,149 Therefore, \nmultiagent chemotherapy regimens are generally reserved only for \nrefractory disease to multiple prior therapies or bulky lymph node or solid \norgan disease, and/or as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic cell \ntransplant (HCT).  \nData supporting the use of some of these agents in patients with MF and \nSS are discussed below. The data for systemic therapy agents, \nparticularly those studied in larger prospective phase II and III studies, are \nalso summarized in Table 1.  Systemic Retinoids \nBexarotene, an oral retinoid, can have prolonged disease control without \ncumulative toxicity and is often considered for patients with higher skin \nburden with plaque disease.104,105 In phase II –III studies, oral bexarotene \n(≥300 mg/m2) was well tolerated, resulting in an ORR of 45% to 67% in \npatients with early -stage and advanced- stage disease.104,105 Results from \na retrospective study of the Spanish Working Group of Cutaneous Lymphomas (174 patients with MF and 42 patients with SS) also \ndemonstrated the long- term safety and efficacy of bexarotene (ORR of \n70%; 26% CR).\n150 Hypertriglyceridemia (79%), hypercholesterolemia \n(71%), and hypothyroidism (52%) were the most common treatment -\nrelated adverse events.  \nGiven the favorable tolerability profile without significant cumulative toxicity, bexarotene should be considered for patients with early -stage MF \nwho have insufficient disease control with skin- directed therapy. It is \nimportant to note that bexarotene is associated with hypertriglyceridemia \nand central hypothyroidism, which necessitates laboratory monitoring for \ntriglycerides, and free thyroxine (T4), often requiring additional \nmanagement.  \nBexarotene is also used in combination with phototherapy or ECP for early -stage disease with inadequate response to single- agent therapy and  \nin patients with advanced- stage disease.\n151-154 \nRetinoic -acid receptor (RAR) agonists such as acitretin and isotretinoin \n(13-cis-retinoic acid) have also been shown to be effective for the \ntreatment of early -stage MF.155-157 In a small cohort of 35 patients with \nearly -stage MF, acitretin and isotretinoin resulted in ORRs of 64% and \n80%, respectively (although the CR rates were low at 4% and 8%, respectively).\n156  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-25 Brentuximab Vedotin  \nIn the ALCANZA trial, brentuximab vedotin, an anti -CD30 antibody drug \nconjugate, was more effective than methotrexate or bexarotene in patients \nwith previously treated MF (≥ stage IB).100 The final analysis confirmed \nthat brentuximab vedotin resulted in significantly improved ORR lasting for \nat least 4 months (ORR4; 55% vs.13%), median PFS (17 vs. 4 months), \nand patient -reported symptom burden compared to methotrexate or \nbexarotene in patients with CD30- positive MF.101 Peripheral neuropathy \nwas the most common adverse event reported in 44 (69%) patients. At the \nmedian follow -up of 46 months, 86% (38 of 44) of patients had complete \nresolution or improvement to grades 1 and 2.  \nIn the ALCANZA trial, CD30 positivity was defined as CD30 expression in \n≥10% of total lymphoid cells in at least one skin biopsy (43% of patients \nhad at least 1 sample with CD30 <10%).100 The results of an exploratory \nanalysis showed that brentuximab vedotin resulted in higher ORR4 and improved PFS in patients with ≥10% CD30 expression, regardless of LCT \nstatus.\n158 The ORR4 (41% vs. 10% for <10% CD30 min expression; 57% vs. \n10% for ≥10% CD30 min expression) and median PFS (17 vs. 2 months for \n<10% CD30 min expression; 16 vs. 4 months for ≥10% CD30 min expression) \nwere significantly higher for brentuximab vedotin compared to vorinostat \nacross all CD30 expression levels.  \nIn other phase II studies, clinical responses with brentuximab vedotin were observed across all CD30 expression levels (including negligible CD30 \nexpression) and in patients with high blood Sézary cell count.\n159,160 \nLesions with <5% CD30 expression had a lower likelihood of global \nresponse than those with ≥5% CD30 expression ( P < .005), but responses \nare still seen in those with CD30 positivity of ≥1% or non -detectable CD30 \nby IHC using light microscopy.159,160 While responses were observed in \npatients with very low or absent CD30 expression, the likelihood and/or depth of response may be lower in these situations and further studies are \nneeded to define the activity of brentuximab in this setting. Real world cohort studies have also reported favorable outcomes with brentuximab \nvedotin in patients with previously treated MF and SS and variable CD30 \npositivity.\n161,162  \nBrentuximab vedotin is a more effective treatment option than \nmethotrexate or bexarotene for patients with CD30- positive MF but carries \ngreater risk, particularly a cumulative risk of peripheral neuropathy.163 \nPatients with SS were excluded from the ALCANZA  trial and the efficacy \nof brentuximab vedotin in patients with SS in the setting of refractory disease or low CD30 skin expression has only been demonstrated in a \nsmall case series of 13 patients.\n164 \nMogamulizumab  \nIn the MAVORIC trial, mogamulizumab, a humanized anti -CCR4 \nmonoclonal antibody, was more effective than vorinostat in patients with previously treated MF (≥ stage IB) and SS. Mogamulizumab resulted in \nsignificantly higher ORR (28% vs. 5%) and median PFS (8  vs. 3 months) \ncompared with vorinostat and the ORR was higher in patients with SS \nthan those with MF (37% vs. 21%).\n102 Patients with LCT at study entry \nwere excluded from this trial. In a post hoc  analysis, the number of prior \ntherapies did not impact the ORR, PFS, and duration of response \nobserved with mogamulizumab.165 Among the 186 patients randomly \nassigned to vorinostat, 136 patients (109 patients with disease \nprogression and 27 patients after intolerable toxicity) crossed over to \nmogamulizumab. The ORR was 31% for the 133 patients who crossed \nover from vorinostat to mogamulizumab and subsequently received \nmogamulizumab. The most common adverse events associated with \nmogamulizumab were mostly grade 1– 2 and manageable (infusion- related \nreactions [37%], skin eruptions [25%], and diarrhea [14%]). Pyrexia (4%) and celluli tis (3%) were the most common grade 3 adverse events in the \nmogamulizumab group.  Patients with the greatest symptom burden and \nfunctional impairment derived the most benefit from mogamulizumab in \nterms of quality of life.\n166 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

The compartment -specific ORRs for \nmogamulizumab were 42%, 68%, and 17%, respectively, for skin, blood \ninvolvement, and lymph nodes. The corresponding ORRs for vorinostat \nwere 16%, 19%, and 4%, respectively. The overall disease control rate \nwas 79% (76% for MF and 82% for SS) and improved with long -term \nexposure to mogamulizumab.169 This trial, however, was not powered to \ndetect OS differences between the two groups within the defined follow -up \nperiod.  \nThe post -hoc analyses that evaluated the efficacy of mogamulizumab \nbased on blood tumor burden showed that blood involvement was \nassociated with improved ORRs, PFS, and time to next treatment (TTNT) \nfor patients treated with mogamulizumab.167,168 The ORRs were 26% and \n37%, respectively, for patients with B1 and B2 blood involvement \ncompared to 16% for those with B0 blood involvement.167 The median \nPFS was 11 months and 8 months, respectively, for patients with B2 and B1 blood involvement compared to 5 months for those with B0 blood \ninvolvement.\n168 The TTNT was 20 months for those with B2 blood \ninvolvement compared to 12 months and 7 months, respectively, for \nthose with B1 and B0 blood involvement.168 Mogamulizumab also was \nassociated with sustained reductions seen in CD4+  CD26 - cell counts \nand CD4:CD8 ratios in patients for all B classes of blood involvement.  \nA drug- induced skin eruption that has variable clinical and pathologic \nfeatures (and can mimic CTCL) was the most frequent adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation in the MAVORIC trial.102,170- 173 \nMogamulizumab -associated skin rash has also been identified as a \npotential marker for tumor response.174 Skin biopsy (with adequate \nimmunohistochemical stains and clonality assessment) is recommended \nto rule out disease progression in patients experiencing drug- induced \nskin eruptions or mogamulizumab -associated skin rash.172,175,176   \nHistone Deacetylase Inhibitors \nVorinostat was the first HDAC inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of \nMF and SS. In the initial phase IIB registration study, vorinostat resulted in \nan ORR of 30%.107 A post-hoc subset analysis of patients who \nexperienced clinical benefit with ≥2 years of vorinostat therapy in the \nphase IIB study provided some evidence for the long- term safety and \nefficacy of vorinostat in patients with heavily pretreated MF and SS.108 \nWhile cumulative toxicities were rare with vorinostat, patients need to be \nmonitored for gastrointestinal toxicity, including nausea, diarrhea, and \nresultant dehydration, which could be more detrimental for older patients.  \nRomidepsin has demonstrated clinical activity across all disease compartments.\n109-111 The median duration of response is 13 to 15 months \nfor patients with disease responding to romidepsin.109,110 Importantly, \nromidepsin was associated with a high rate of reduction in pruritus score \nirrespective of clinical objective response. The compartment -specific \nORRs were 40%, 35%, 32%, and 27%, respectively, for skin involvement, \nerythroderma, blood involvem ent, and lymphadenopathy.111 It is important \nto initially monitor for QTc prolongation when administering romidepsin, \nparticularly with the concomitant use of antiemetics that also prolong QTc. \nRomidepsin is included as a preferred regimen for patients with SS with \nhigh Sézary cell burden.  \nDenileukin Diftitox  \nDenileukin diftitox (a recombinant human interleukin- 2 diphtheria toxin \nfusion protein), initially approved for relapsed/refractory CTCL,177,178 was PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

A \nreformulated version of denileukin diftitox was evaluated in Study 302 for \npatients with relapsed or refractory MF and SS.103 LCT-MF was not an \nexclusion criteria but no patients with LCT- MF were enrolled in the study. \nCD25 -positiity was defined as detectable CD25 in ≥20% of total lymphoid \ncells in biopsy specimen by IHC.  \nThe primary efficacy analysis included 69 patients with MF (stage IA –\nstage IIIB). The majority of the patients had stage IB –IIA (n = 25) or stage \nIIB (n = 24) disease. Denileukin diftitox resulted  in an ORR of 36% (as \nassessed by an independent review committee) and the median duration \nof response was 9 months.103 The ORR were higher for stage IIB disease \n(46%) compared to those with stage IA –IIA disease (37%) or stage III \ndisease (20%). There was no correlation between the CD25 expression \nand the efficacy of denileukin diftitox. Reduction in skin disease burden \nwas observed across all stages (84%; 54 out of the 64 evaluable patients). \nTreatment -related adverse events of special interest including capillary \nleak syndrome (CLS; typically occurring during the first 2 cycles; 20%; \ngrade ≥3, 6%), infusion- related reacti ons (74%), hypersensitivity (68%) \nand hepatotoxicity (36%) were mostly grade 1– 2, with no evidence of \ncumulative toxicity.  \nDenileukin diftitox is included as a preferred systemic therapy option for \nstage IIB (generalized tumor disease) and as an option under useful in \ncertain circumstances for stage IB –IIA, stage IIB (limited) and stage III \ndisease.  \nAlemtuzumab  \nAlemtuzumab (a humanized anti -CD52 monoclonal antibody) has \nsignificant clinical activity in patients with previously treated advanced MF \nand SS.115-120 The ORR with alemtuzumab (30 mg IV) was higher in \npatients with erythroderma or SS than those with advanced MF; however, it was associated with myelotoxicities and infectious complications.\n116,120 Reduced- dose subcutaneous alemtuzumab (3– 15 mg per administration) \ngiven for a shorter duration was equally effective with lower incidence of \ninfectious complications in patients with SS.117 While alemtuzumab is no \nlonger commercially available, it may be obtained for compassionate use \nfor patients with CTCL and other hematologic malignancies.   \nPembrolizumab  \nIn a phase II trial, pembrolizumab (an immune checkpoint inhibitor) \nresulted in durable responses in both MF and SS with an ORR of 38% and \nmedian duration of response not reached at a median follow -up of 58 \nweeks.121 Pembrolizumab was associated with a skin flare reaction, \noccurring exclusively in patients with SS; the flare reaction correlated with \nhigh PD -1 expression on Sezary cells, and it should be distinguished from \ndisease progression.  \nPralatrexat e \nPralatrexate is a folate analog with demonstrated activity in patients with \nheavily pretreated MF and SS.112-114 In a multicenter dose -finding study \nthat evaluated pralatrexate (10– 30 mg/m2 given weekly for 2 of 3 weeks or \n3 of 4 weeks) in 54 patients with relapsed or refractory MF and SS, the \nORR for all evaluable patients was 41% (6% CR).112 Among the 29 \npatients who received the recommended dose (15 mg/m2 weekly for 3 \nweeks of a 4 -week cycle), the ORR was 45% (3% CR).112 In the subgroup \nof patients with relapsed/refractory LCT of MF treated on the PROPEL trial, pralatrexate (30 mg/m\n2) resulted in an ORR of 58% (25% by \nindependent review).113 The median PFS and OS were 5 months and 13 \nmonths, respectively.  \nGemcitabine  \nGemcitabine monotherapy is an effective treatment option for patients with \nheavily pretreated advanced- stage MF and SS.135-142 In a retrospective \nobservational study of 25 patients with advanced MF and SS, after a long- term follow -up of 15 years, the estimated OS, PFS, and DFS rates PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

Another real -life cohort study (36 \npatient s; MF, n = 34; SS, n = 2) also confirmed the activity of pegylated \nliposomal doxorubicin for advanced MF and SS, especially in patients with tumor stage disease.\n147   Extracorporeal Photopheresis  \nECP has been demonstrated as an effective treatment option in many \nretrospective studies, resulting in an ORR of 42% to 74%.133,179- 186  \nIn a meta -analysis involving more than 400 patients with MF and SS, ECP \nas monotherapy resulted in a 56% ORR with a 15% CR.180 The \ncorresponding response rates were 58% (15% CR) for erythrodermic disease (T4) and 43% (10% CR) for SS. In one retrospective study of 39 \npatients with MF and SS (31 patients with T4 disease and 8 patients with \nT2 disease), ECP resulted in a skin ORR of  74% (33% of patients \nachieved ≥50% partial skin response and 41% of patients achieved ≥90% improvement).\n183 After a median follow -up of 72 months, the median OS \nwas 9 years from diagnosis and 7 years from the initiation of treatment with ECP.  Another retrospective study of 50 patients with MF reported an \nORR of 42% and an OS of 72 months with no statistically s ignificant \ndifferences in OS among patients with early -stage and late -stage disease \n(77 months and 69 months, respectively; P = .077).\n185 A real -word \nretrospective analysis (52 patients; 50% of patients has SS and 37% had \nMF) also showed that ECP is an effective treatment options for patients \nwith MF and SS, resulting in a response rate of 37% (51% reduction in \nBSA) and the median time to r esponse was 6.5 months.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-29 Combination Therapies \nSkin -Directed + Systemic Therapies \nPhototherapy is most commonly used in combination with either IFN189-192 \nor systemic retinoid.151,157,193- 195  \nIn a prospective randomized study that evaluated IFN combined with \nPUVA versus IFN combined with retinoids in patients with stage I or II \nCTCL (n = 82 evaluable), the combination of IFN with PUVA resulted in \nsignificantly higher CR rates in this patient population (70% vs. 38%).189 In \nanother prospective phase II trial in patients with early -stage MF (stages \nIA–IIA; n = 89), the combination of low -dose IFN alfa with PUVA resulted \nin an ORR of 98% (84% CR).191  \nIn a phase III randomized study from the EORTC that evaluated the combination of bexarotene with PUVA compared with PUVA alone in \npatients with early -stage MF (stage IB and IIA; n = 93), the ORR for the \ncombination of bexarotene with PUVA was 77% (31% CR) compared to 71% (22% CR) for PUVA alone; the median duration of response was 6 \nmonths and 10 months, respectively.\n151 A trend towards fewer PUVA \nsessions and lower UVA doses to achieve CR was observed with the combination arm, although the differences were not significant.\n151 This trial \nwas closed prematurely due to low patient accrual.  \nA small prospective study evaluated the combination of low -dose \nbexarotene in combination with PUVA maintenance in 21 patients with MF \nand SS (stages IB –IV) resistant or intolerant to previous therapies.193 The \nORR was 86% after induction therapy with bexarotene (93% for early -stage disease and 66.6% for advanced disease). At the end of \nmaintenance, the ORR was 76% (33% CR) and the median event -free \nsurvival (EFS) for the whole group was 31 months.\n  \nIn a retrospective analysis of 128 patients with MF (118 patients had \nearly -stage disease; stage ≤ IIA), acitretin (either as monotherapy or in combination with phototherapy or topical steroids) resulted in an ORR of 77% (44% CR and 33% PR) with a trend towards better response rate in \nthe combination arm compared to monotherapy.\n157 The median duration of \nresponse was 24 months.  \nECP used in combination with TSEBT or phototherapy (narrowband UVB or PUVA) has also resulted in high durable clinical response in patients \nwith erythrodermic MF and SS.\n196,197 In a retrospective study of 44 patients \nwith erythrodermic MF, the combination of TSEBT with ECP (concurrent or sequential following TSEBT) significantly improved PFS compared with \nTSEBT alone.\n196 The 2- year PFS and OS rates were 36% and 63%, \nrespectively, for patients treated with TSEBT alone compared with 66% and 88% for those treated with TSEBT + ECP.  \nThere are limited efficacy and safety data for the use of TSEBT in \ncombination with systemic retinoids, brentuximab vedotin, HDAC inhibitors \n(vorinostat or romidepsin), or mogamulizumab.\n198- 202  \nSystemic Combination Therapies  \nSystemic combination therapy regimens have been shown to improve \nresponse rates in patients with early -stage disease with inadequate \nresponse to single- agent therapy or those with advanced- stage CTCL.  \nECP with IFN and/or systemic retinoid and IFN with systemic retinoid are the most commonly evaluated combination therapies for patients with \nCTCL.\n152-154,203 -205 The combination of oral isotretinoin and IFN alfa \nresulted in an ORR of 85% and the estimated 5- year OS rate was 94% for \npatients with early -stage MF and 35% for advanced- stage MF.152 ECP in \ncombination with IFN and/or systemic retinoids resulted in a response rate of 84% in patients with advanced CTCL and the 5 -year OS rates for the \nsubgroups of patients with stage IIIB, IVA1, IVA2, and IVB were 80%, 80%, 76%, and 0%, respectively.\n204,205 Other systemic combination \ntherapy regimens have also been studied.206-208  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-30 However, aforementioned studies that have evaluated the systemic \ncombination regimens are limited by small sample size and there are no \ndata from prospective randomized clinical studies to support the use of a \nspecific systemic combination therapy regimen.   \nAdditional Therapy Based on Response to Primary Treatment  \nHistorically, the response criteria for MF and SS were poorly defined and \nvalidated response assessments were lacking. Response criteria for MF \nand SS have not been demonstrated to correlate with prognosis, and \nresponses can vary between the different disease compartments (ie, skin, \nblood, lymph nodes).  \nMore recent studies have incorporated consensus response assessments \nand newer FDA -approved agents have undergone central review for \nefficacy outcomes. A proposal for the standardization of definition of \nresponse in skin, nodes, blood, and viscera has been published.209 The \ndecisions to continue with or switch treatment regimens are often made \nbased on clinical parameters. Imaging with the same modalities used in \nworkup is indicated when there is suspicion of disease progression or \nextracutaneous disease.  \nAll patients (stage IA –IV) with a clinical benefit and/or those with disease \nresponding to primary treatment should be considered for maintenance or tapering of regimens to optimize response duration. Disease relapse (with \nthe same stage) after discontinuation of therapy often responds well to \nretreatment with previous therapy. Patients with persistent disease \nfollowing completion of primary treatment should be treated with the other \nprimary treatment options not received before to improve response before \nmoving onto treatment for refractory disease.  \nCurrently there is no definitive treatment for refractory disease that can \nproduce reliable durable remissions or curative results. Participation in a \nclinical trial is recommended for all patients with refractory disease. Multiagent  chemotherapy regimens recommended for PTCL can be \nconsidered for the treatment of refractory disease to multiple prior therapies.  \nSpecial Considerations for Clinical Situations with Specific \nPathologic Features  \nFolliculotropic Mycosis Fungoides  \nFMF is characterized by the infiltration of hair follicles by atypical T \nlymphocytes and resultant alopecia. Disease typically presents as plaques \nand tumors mainly on the head/neck and the risk profile varies with stage \nof the disease.21,210- 213 Recent studies have reported that FMF presents \nwith two distinct patterns of clinicopathologic features with different \nprognostic implications (early stage and advanced stage). In a subgroup of \npatients with early skin- limited disease, FMF has an indolent disease \ncourse and a favorable prognosis, with early -stage cutaneous disease \nassociated with significantly higher disease- specific survival compared to \nadvanced- stage cutaneous disease.214-216  \nIn a report from the Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma Group that evaluated \nthe treatment outcomes in patients with FMF (203 patients; 84 patients \nwith early -stage FMF, 102 patients with advanced- stage FMF, and 17 \npatients with extracutaneous FMF), treatment with t opical steroids and \nphototherapy with UVB or PUVA were more effective in patients with \nearly -stage FMF resulting in an ORR of 83% (28% CR), 83%, and 88%, \nrespectively.217 Local RT, TSEBT, and PUVA combined with RT were \nmore effective in patients with advanced -stage FMF resulting in an ORR \nof 100% (63% CR), 100% (59% CR), and 75% (5% CR), respectively.  \nPatients with early -stage FMF may benefit from standard skin -directed \ntherapies used for the treatment of early -stage MF, and those with \ngeneralized indolent/plaque FMF (without evidence of LCT) should initially \nbe considered for single- agent systemic therapy regimens before receiving \nmultiagent chemotherapy regimens.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-31 Large -Cell Transformation  \nLCT is diagnosed when large cells are present in >25% of \nlymphoid/tumor cell infiltrates in a skin lesion biopsy, and the incidence \nof LCT is strongly dependent on the disease stage at diagnosis (1% for \nearly -stage disease, compared with 27% for stage IIB disease and 56% –\n67% for stage IV disease).8-10 LCT is often, but not always, aggressive. \nCD30 expression is associated with LCT in MF or SS in 30% to 50% of \ncases, and this finding may have potential implications for CD30 -directed \ntherapies.8-10,218 However, it should be noted that CD30 expression is \nvariable in MF and SS, with the leukemic Sézary cells typically being \nCD30 -negative.  \nSystemic therapy (brentuximab vedotin, gemcitabine, liposomal \ndoxorubicin, pralatrexate, romidepsin, or pembrolizumab) with \nskin-directed therapies is the initial treatment for generalized cutaneous \nor extracutaneous lesions with LCT. In addition, concurrent management of coexisting disease based on clinical stage is recommended. Selected \npatients with localized LCT (ie, restricted to one or few T3 lesions or \nstage IA –IIA plaque disease) could be treated with EBRT alone, with \ncontinuation of other treatment  modalities used prior to transformation. \nDepending on the goals of treatment, multiagent chemotherapy regimens \nrecommended for PTCL may be appropriate for the management of LCT, \nwhich is refractory to multiple prior therapies or when significant \nextracuta neous disease is present.   \nRole of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplant in MFSS  \nAllogeneic HCT has a role in a subset of patients with advanced -stage \nMF and SS who have received multiple lines of therapy as shown in \nretrospective studies and small prospective series of patients with \nadvanced MF and SS.\n219- 226  \nIn a multicenter retrospective analysis of 37 patients with advanced -stage \nprimary CTCL treated with allogeneic HCT (24 patients [65%] had stage IV MFSS or disseminated nodal or visceral involvement), after a median \nfollow- up of 29 months, the incidence of relapse was 56% and the \nestimated 2 -year OS and PFS rates were 57% and 31%, respectively.219  \nIn a retrospective analysis of patients with advanced- stage MF and SS in \nthe European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) \ndatabase (n = 60) treated with allogeneic HCT, the 5- year PFS and OS \nrates were 32% and 46%, respectively. The corresponding 7- year survival \nrates were 44% and 30%, respectively.220 The non- relapse mortality \n(NRM) rate at 7 years was 22%. Outcomes were not significantly different between histology types. However, patients with advanced- stage disease \nhad an increased risk of relapse or progression as well as lower PFS, and myeloablati ve conditioning was associated with poorer NRM and OS. In \nan updated analysis, advanced- stage disease (refractory disease or PD \nafter ≥3 lines of systemic therapy prior to transplant), a short interval \nbetween diagnosis, and transplant (<18 months) were independent \nadverse prognostic factors for PFS; advanced- stage disease and the use \nof unrelated donors were independent adverse prognostic factors for OS.\n224  \nIn a case series of 47 patients with advanced -stage MF and SS who \nunderwent allogeneic HCT after disease progression on conventional \ntherapy, the estimated 4 -year OS and PFS rates were 51% and 26%, \nrespectively.222 While there was no statistical difference in the OS in \npatients who had MF without LCT, SS, MF with LCT, or SS with LCT, the \n4-year PFS rate was superior in patients who had SS versus those who \ndid not (52% vs.10%; P  = .02).  Another multicenter retrospective study, \nalthough limited by small sample size (26 patients; MF, n = 17; SS, n = \n9), reported superior outcomes with allogeneic HCT in patients with SS \ncompared to MF.226 After a median follow -up of 5 years, patients with SS \nhad lower relapse rates (11% at 5 years), longer TTNT (not reached), higher treatment -free survival (89% at 5 years) and OS (5 -year OS rate PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

Other systematic review and meta- analysis have reported \npooled PFS and OS rates of 36% and 59%, respectively, following allogeneic HCT in patients with advanced- stage MF and SS.\n227,228 \nThe survival benefit of allogeneic HCT in patients with advanced MF and \nSS was confirmed in a prospective, multicenter, propensity \nscore -matched, controlled trial (99 patients with advanced MF and SS; \n55 patients assigned to the allogeneic HCT group and 44  patients \nassigned to the non -allogeneic HCT treatment option of investigator’s \nchoice).229 After a median follow -up of 13 months, the median PFS was \nsignificantly longer in the allogeneic HCT group (9 vs. 3 months in the \nnon-allogeneic HCT group; P < .0001). The 1- year PFS rates were 51% \nand 14%, respectively, for patients in the allogeneic HCT group and \nnon-allogeneic HCT group. The 1 -year cumulative incidence of relapse \nwas also lower in the allogeneic HCT group (45% compared to 86% in \nthe non -allogeneic HCT group).  \nThe use of TSEBT with non- myeloablative allogeneic HCT has also been \nevaluated in patients with advanced MF and SS.230-232 In a study of 19 \npatients with advanced CTCL, the use of TSEBT prior to allogeneic HCT \nprovided improved disease control with an ORR of 68% (58% CR) with \nmedian OS not reached at the time of the report; the treatment -related \nmortality (TRM) rate was 21%.230 The safety and efficacy of a \nnon-myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of TSEBT and total \nlymphoid irradiation (TLI) + anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG) has also been \ndemonstrated in prospective clinical studies.233,234 In a prospective clinical \nstudy of 35 patients with advanced- stage disease (13 patients with MF \nand 22 patients with SS), this regimen was associated with 1- year and \n2-year NRM of 3% and 14%, respectively.233 The 2- year incidence of \nmoderate/severe chronic graft -versus- host disease (GVHD) was 32%. \nWith a median post -transplant follow -up of 5 years, the 2 -year, 3 -year, and 5-year OS rates were 68%, 62%, and 56%, respectively. The 5- year PFS \nrate was 41%. Patients >65 years of age at the time of transplant had \nsimilar clinical outcomes compared with younger patients. This study also \nevaluated the utilization of high- throughpu t sequencing (HTS) to monitor \nminimal residual disease (MRD), and molecular remission aft er allogeneic \nHCT (achieved in 43% of patients) was associated with a lower incidence \nof PD or relapse. In another prospective study that evaluated the same \nnon-myeloablative conditioning regimen (TSEBT + TLI + ATG) in 41 \npatients with advanced -stage disease (34 patients with MF and 7 patients \nwith SS), the 1 -year and 2- year NRM rates were 10% and 13%, \nrespectively.234 Grade ≥2 acute and chronic GVHD were reported in 32% \nand 24% of patients, respectively. After a median follow -up of 5 years after \ntransplant, the 5- year OS rate was 38% for the entire study population \n(37% for MF and 57% for SS). The 5- year cumulative inc idence of disease \nprogression or relapse was 53% for all patients and these rates were \nsignificantly lower for patients achieving CR following transplant (21% \ncompared to 71% in those not in CR; P  = .006).  \nAllogeneic HCT may be considered for appropriate patients with stage \nIIB–IV disease that is refractory to multiple primary treatment options.235 \nBased on the limited evidence, patients with erythrodermic MF and SS \nappear to receive the most benefit from allogeneic HCT, despite high \npost-transplant relapse rate. Allogeneic HCT is generally reserved for \npatients with systemic disease and/or extensiv e skin involvement that is \nrefractory to or progressive after multiple lines of systemic therapy options. \nWhen appropriate, TSEBT may be considered as cytoreductive therapy \nbefore transplant.230,233 Novel conditioning regimens are being explored to \nprovide improved disease control while limiting transplant -related \ncomplications.  \nA transplant decision requires careful counseling to weigh the significant \nrisks of this procedure versus the likelihood of long- term benefits and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

The ideal timing for allogeneic HCT is \nwhen the disease is well controlled with induction therapy and before the \ndisease has progressed to a state where the chance of response or \nsurvival with allogeneic HCT is low.236  \nAutologous HCT is not recommended for patients with CTCL, due to \nshort duration of response despite its toxicity, thus limiting its utility.235,237 \nWhile the majority of the deaths among patients undergoing autologous \nHCT may be attributable to PD, deaths associated with allogeneic HCT \nmay be more due to NRM (the incidence of 1- year NRM in published \nreports with allogeneic HCT is approximately 11% –25%).219- 223  \nSupportive Care  \nManagement of Pruritus  \nSymptoms of pruritus can be present in a large majority (nearly 90%) of \npatients with CTCL, and may be associated with decreased quality of life \nfor patients.238-240 Patients should be evaluated for pruritus at each visit. \nOther potential causes of pruritus (eg, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, \npsoriasis, other inflammatory skin conditions) should be ruled out. The \nextent of pruritus (localized vs. generalized) and potential correlation \nbetween disease site and localization of pruritus should be noted.  \nThe treatment of pruritus requires optimizing skin- directed and systemic \ntreatments. Daily use of moisturizers and emollients are helpful in \nmaintaining and protecting the skin barrier. Topical steroids (with or \nwithout occlusion) can be effective in managing the disease and \naccompanying pruritus in early -stage disease.240,241 First-line options \ninclude H1 antihistamines (single- agent or combination of antihistamines \nfrom different classes) or the anticonvulsant gabapentin.238,242,243 \nNeurokinin- 1 (NK -1) receptor antagonist aprepitant,244-246 the tetracyclic \nantidepressant mirtazapine, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \n(SSRIs) may be considered in the second -line setting.247,248 Treatment with the oral opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone may be considered if symptoms of pruritus do not resolve with the above agents.\n249  \nPrevention and Treatment of Infections  \nInfectious complications are frequent among patients with MF and SS, \nparticularly cutaneous bacterial infections and cutaneous herpes viral \ninfections (eg, herpes simplex virus [HSV] or herpes zoster virus [HZV] \ninfections).250 Bacteremia/sepsis and bacterial pneumonia were reported \nas the major cause of death due to infections in a retrospective cohort \nstudy of patients with MF and SS.250 Several preventive measures such as \nmaintaining/protecting the skin barrier (routine use of skin moisturizers and/or emollients), bleach baths or soaks (for limited areas only), \navoidance of central lines (particularly for erythrodermic patients), and \nprophylactic use of mupirocin in cases of Staphylococcus aureus  \ncolonization can be incorporated to minimize infectious complications. HSV prophylaxis with acyclovir or equivalent should be considered for \npatients with frequent recurrence of HSV infection. Patients undergoing \ntreatment with alemtuzumab- containing regimens should be closely \nmonitored for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and preemptively treated with antivirals to avoid overt CMV disease.  \nCultures from skin swab and nares (nostrils) should be taken to evaluate for S. aureus  colonization/infection in patients with erythroderma and an \nactive or suspected infection. Antimicrobial treatments may include intranasal mupirocin and/or oral dicloxacillin or cephalexin. Bleach baths \nor soaks may be helpful if the affected area is limi ted. Doxycycline or \ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) should be considered for \npatients with suspected methicillin- resistant S. aureus  (MRSA) infection. If \nno improvements in infection status are observed with the above agents, \nor if bacteremia is suspected, vancomycin should be initiated, or \nappropriate alternative antibiotic options can be considered.\n251 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-37  \n \nPrimary Cutaneous CD30+ T -Cell Lymphoproliferative \nDisorders \nPrimary cutaneous CD30+ T- cell lymphoproliferative disorders (PCTLD) \nrepresent a spectrum that includes primary cutaneous anaplastic large- cell \nlymphoma (PC -ALCL), lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), and “borderline” \ncases with overlapping clinical and histopathologic features.252,253 In a \nSEER database analysis of 14,942 cases of CTCL diagnosed in the \nUnited States between 2000 and 2018, PC -ALCL was the second most \ncommon CTCL with MF being the most common CTCL.5 Primary \ncutaneous disease, spontaneous regression, and absence of \nextracutaneous spread are associated with a better prognosis.254,255 \nPC-ALCL represents approximately 8% of all cutaneous T- cell lymphomas \n(CTCL) and is histologically characterized by diffuse, cohesive sheets of \nlarge CD30- positive (in >75%) cells with anaplastic, pleomorphic, or \nimmunoblastic appearance.2 Patches and plaques may also be present, \nand some degree of spontaneous remittance in lesions may also be seen. \nPC-ALCL typically follows an indolent course with an excellent prognosis, \nalthough cutaneous relapses are more common.256- 258 A SEER database \nanalysis of 501 cases of PC -ALCL diagnosed in the United States \nbetween 2005 and 2016, reported favorable overall survival (OS) rates (5-year and 10 -year OS rates were 81% and 62%, respectively) with age \n≥60 years and the use of chemotherap y were predictive of lower OS \nrates.\n259 Clinical features typically include solitary or localized nodules or \ntumors (often ulcerated); multifocal lesions occur in approximately 20% of cases. Extracutaneous disease occurs in approximately 10% of cases, \nusually involving regional lymph nodes.\n257 The presence of multiple \ncutaneous lesions at presentation, extensive skin lesions on the leg, disease progression to extracutaneous disease, early cutaneous relapse, and nodal progression are associated with poorer outcomes.\n260-262  \nLyP is histologically heterogenous with large atypical anaplastic, \nimmunoblastic, or Hodgkin- like cells in a marked inflammatory \nbackground.253 Several histologic subtypes have been defined based on \nthe evolution of skin lesions. Clinical features include chronic, recurrent, \nspontaneously regressing papulonodular (grouped or generalized) skin \nlesions. LyP is not considered a malignant disorder and has an excellent \nprognosis with an OS rate of 92% at 5 and 10 years.258 However, LyP has \nalso been reported to be associated with an increased risk of secondary lymphomas such as mycosis fungoides (MF), PC -ALCL, systemic ALCL, \nor Hodgkin lymphoma.\n263-268 Older age, positive TCR  gene rearrangement, \nor diagnosis of mixed- type LyP have been reported as prognostic \nindicators of disease progression to lymphoma.264,266 \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice \nGuidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Primary Cutaneous \nLymphomas, an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain key literature on PCTLD published since the \nprevious Guidelines update using the following search terms: primary \ncutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma  and LyP. The PubMed \ndatabase was chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical liter ature.\n13  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. The data from key PubMed articles deemed as \nrelevant to these guidelines have been included in this version of the \nDiscussion section. Recommendations for which high- level evidence is \nlacking are based on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and \nexpert opinion.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-38 The complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org .  \nDiagnosis  \nAs described earlier, PCTLD is a spectrum of clinical presentation including LyP (mostly papular and always regressing), PC -ALCL (mostly \nnodular and persistent), and also “borderline” presentations where lesions regress but take longer or are larger and not papular as in LyP.\n2 Clinical \nand pathologic correlation is essential for distinguishing within the \nspectrum of PCTLD as well as distinguishing PCTLD from other \ncutaneous CD30+ disorders (ie, systemic ALCL, adult T- cell \nleukemia/lymphoma [ATLL], peripheral T -cell lymphoma [PTC L], MF with \nlarge cell transformation [MF -LCT], and benign disorders such as \nlymphomatoid drug reactions, arthropod bites, viral infections). MF and PCTLD can coexist in the same patient. Lymphomatoid drug reactions \nhave been linked with certain drugs (eg, amlodipine, carbamazepine, \ncefuroxime) and may be associated with CD30+ atypical large cells in \nhistology. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) is less often associated with \nMF and PCTLD than previously thought; however, coexpression of CD30 \nand CD15 in these T -cell lymphomas may lead to a mistaken diagnosis of \nCHL.\n269 It is therefore important not to diagnose CD30+ T- cell lymphomas \nin lymph nodes as Hodgkin lymphoma.  \nComplete skin examination (for any sign of benign or malignant skin \nlesions), adequate biopsy (punch, incisional, or excisional) of suspicious \nskin lesions, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of skin biopsy specimen are \nessential to confirm the diagnosis. Molecular analysis to detect clonal TCR \ngene rearrangements, e xcisional or incisional biopsy of suspicious lymph \nnodes, and assessment of human T -cell lymphotropic virus type 1 \n(HTLV -1) serology to identify CD30+ ATLL would be helpful in selected \ncircumstances . However, TCR gene rearrangement may not be \ndemonstrated in all cases of PCTLD and TCR rearrangements can also be seen in patients with non -malignant conditions. Demonstration of identical \nclones in skin, blood, and/or lymph nodes may be helpful in selected \ncases.36 Identification of clonal TCR gene rearrangement has no definitive \nestablished prognostic value; however, it could be helpful to determine clinical staging or assess relapsed or residual disease.   \nPCTLD are characterized by the following immunophenotype: CD30+ \n(>75% cells), CD4+, variable loss of CD2/CD5/CD3, and CD8+ (<5%) \ncytotoxic granule -associated proteins positive. ALK -positive PC -ALCL is \nextremely uncommon and t(2;5) translocation is typicall y absent in CD30+ \nPCTLD.\n270,271 ALK positivity and differential expression of t(2;5) can help to \ndistinguish between CD30+ PCTLD and ALCL of nodal origin.  GATA3 \nexpression by IHC has been proposed to be useful to differentiate \nbetween MF- LCT and CD30+ PCTLD.272 MF-LCT was associated with a \nstrong/diffuse expression of GATA3 while the CD30+ PCTLD showed \nvariable/moderate expression of GATA3 . MUM1 expression is valuable to \ndistinguish between LyP and PC -ALCL, since the majority of cases of LyP \n(87%) are positive for MUM1 staining compared to only 20% of cases with \nPC-ALCL.273 \nThe IHC panel may include CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD30, CD56, and \nALK. Additional markers such as CD2, CD5, CD7, CD25, TIA1, granzyme \nB, perforin, TCR beta, and TCR delta, IRF4/MUM1, and EMA may be \nuseful in selected circumstances. Abnormal T -cell phenotype and perforin \nexpression are significantly more frequent in PC -ALCL than in transformed \nMF and may be useful for the differential diagnosis between PC -ALCL and \nCD30 -expressing transformed MF.274  \nDUSP22 -IRF4  (6p25.3) gene rearrangement has been described in \npatients with PC -ALCL and LyP but is not associated with prognostic \nsignificance.275- 277 In a large multicenter study that investigated the clinical \nutility of detecting IRF4  translocations in skin biopsies of T- cell \nlymphoproliferative disorders, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-39 IRF4 had a specificity and positive predictive value of 99% and 90%, \nrespectively, for cutaneous ALCL.275 FISH to detect ALK and \nDUSP22 -IRF4 rearrangements would be useful in selected circumstances. \nHTLV -1 status, assessed either by HTLV -1 serology or other methods, \nmay be useful in populations at risk to exclude the diagnosis of \nCD30 -positive ATLL (which is usually HTLV -1 positive).  \nWorkup  \nThe initial workup involves a history and complete physical examination including entire skin, palpation of peripheral lymph node regions, and liver \nor spleen. Laboratory studies should include complete blood count (CBC) \nwith differential, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and assessment of \nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Many skin- directed and systemic \ntherapies are contraindicated or are of unknown safety in pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy testing is recommended for individuals of \nchildbearing age.  \nBiopsy of enlarged lymph nodes or extracutaneous sites is recommended if biopsy of skin is non -diagnostic. Fine- needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy \nalone is not sufficient for the initial diagnosis. Excisional or incisional biopsy is preferred over core needle biopsy. In certain circumstances, \nwhen a lymph node is not easily accessible for excisional or incisional \nbiopsy, a combination of core needle biopsy and FNA biopsy in \nconjunction with appropriate ancillary techniques may be sufficient for \ndiagnosis. Bone marrow evaluation has limited value in the staging of \npatients with PC -ALCL and is not required for disease staging.\n278 Bone \nmarrow aspiration and biopsy may be considered for solitary PC -ALCL or \nPC-ALCL without extracutaneous involvement on imaging.  \nContrast -enhanced CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis or \nintegrated whole- body PET/CT is recommended for PC -ALCL. PET scan \nmay be preferred for patients with extranodal disease, which is inadequately imaged by CT. In LyP, imaging studies and bone marrow \nevaluation are done only if there is suspicion of systemic involvement by \nan associated lymphoma.  \nPrimary Cutaneous ALCL \nRadiation Therapy  \nIn a report from the Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma Group that evaluated the \nlong- term outcome of patients with PCTLD (118 patients with LyP, 79 \npatients with PC -ALCL, and 11 patients with PC -ALCL with regional node \ninvolvement), radiation therapy (RT) or surgic al excision as initial therapy \n(given for 48% and 19% of patients, respectively) resulted in a complete \nresponse (CR) rate of 100% in patients with PC -ALCL.257 After a median \nfollow- up of 61 months, subsequent skin- only relapse and extracutaneous \ndisease were reported in 41% and 10% of patients, respectively.  \nA multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with PC -ALCL (n = 56) \neligible to receive RT (primary therapy or after surgical excision) reported \na clinical complete response (cCR) rate of 95% and a local control rate of \n98% after a median follow -up of 4 years.279 Although the median RT dose \nwas 35 Gy (range, 6– 45 Gy), CRs were seen with doses as low as 6 Gy \nand the achievement of cCR was independent of the RT dose, suggesting \nthat lower RT dose of <30 Gy may be appropriate for the management of \nlocalized lesions. The efficacy of low -dose RT (≤20 Gy) for the treatment \nof solitary or localized PC -ALCL was also confirmed in other recent \nreports.280-282  \nInvolved- site RT (ISRT) alone or surgical excision (with or without ISRT) \nare recommended for patients with solitary or grouped lesions.256-258,283 -286 \nISRT alone is an appropriate option in selected patients with cutaneous \nALCL regional lymph node involvement ± primary skin lesions.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-40 Systemic Therapy  \nIn the ALCANZA study that included 31 patients with previously treated \nPC-ALCL, overall response rate (ORR) lasting for ≥4 months was \nsignificantly higher for brentuximab vedotin compared to the physician’s \nchoice of treatment with methotrexate or bexarotene (75% vs. 20%), and \nthe proportion of patients achieving CR was also higher with brentuximab \nvedotin than with physician’s choice (31% vs. 7%).100  \nIn a multicenter study that evaluated the efficacy of treatment options in \npatients with multifocal lesions included in the Dutch Registry for \nCutaneous Lymphomas prior to the FDA approval of brentuximab vedotin \n(24 patients with initial presentation and 17 patients with relapsed \ndisease), RT (n = 21), systemic chemotherapy (n = 9), and low -dose \nmethotrexate (n = 7) were the most common treatment options resulting in ORRs of 100% (100% CR), 100% (78% CR), and 57% (43% CR), \nrespectively.\n287 The presence of greater than five skin lesions was \nassociated with a higher risk of extracutaneous relapse (56% vs. 20% for the presence of 2– 5 skin lesions).  \nIn the aforementioned report from the Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma \nGroup, which evaluated the long- term outcome of 219 patients with \nPCTLD, 9 of 11 patients (82%) with PC -ALCL and regional node \ninvolvement received CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincrist ine, \nand prednisone) -like multiagent chemotherapy as initial therapy (82%), \nresulting in a CR in eight patients (88%).\n257 However, five out of these \neight patients experienced skin relapses during follow -up. After a median \nfollow- up of 58 months, disease- related 5- year survival rate was 91%.  \nIn November 2018, the FDA approved brentuximab vedotin in combination \nwith cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHP) for the \ntreatment of previously untreated systemic ALCL or other CD30‐ positive \nPTCL based on the results of the ECHELON ‐2 trial, which showed that \nbrentuximab vedotin + CHP was superior to CHOP for patients with CD30 -positive PTCL as shown by a significant improvement in \nprogression- free survival (PFS) and OS.288 This trial, however, excluded \npatients with PC -ALCL. However, since CHOP is included as an option for \nprimary treatment (other recommended regimens) for cutaneous ALCL \nwith regional nodes, the Panel acknowledged that brentuximab vedotin + \nCHP would also b e an appropriate option for these patients.  \nSystemic therapy is indicated only for multifocal lesions (± skin- directed \ntherapy) and for those with regional node involvement (± ISRT). \nBrentuximab vedotin is the preferred systemic treatment option based on \nthe results of the ALCANZA study.100 Low-dose methotrexate (50 mg \nweekly),289,290 pralatrexate,112 systemic retinoids (bexarotene for multifocal \nlesions),291- 294 and interferon (multifocal lesions)291,295- 297 are included as \noptions for other recommended regimens based on the limited available data. Peginterferon alfa- 2a is the only interferon available for clinical use in \nthe United States and it may be substituted for other interferon preparations.\n126-128 Observation (if asymptomatic) is appropriate for \npatients with multifocal lesions.  \nBrentuximab vedotin + CHP is included as an option under other \nrecommended regimens for the primary treatment for patients with \ncutaneous ALCL with regional nodes.288 Multiagent chemotherapy (CHOP \nor CHOEP [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone]) with or without ISRT is included as an option for selected \npatients with regional lymph node involvement.\n257,298 \nLymphomatoid Papulosis  \nIt is important to be reminded that LyP is not a malignant disorder but a recurrent, benign, self -regressing lymphoid proliferation. Although \nmultiagent chemotherapy often leads to reduction or clearance of lesions, rapid recurrence shortly after or even during treatment is a consistent \nfinding in patients with LyP.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-41 In the aforementioned report from the Dutch Cutaneous Lymphoma Group \nthat included 118 patients with LyP, topical steroids and phototherapy \nwere the most common skin- directed therapies used as initial treatment in \n56% and 35% of patients, respectively.257 Although CR or partial response \n(PR) were common, none of these therapies resulted in sustained CR. In a \nretrospective multicenter study of 252 patients with LyP, topical  steroids \nand phototherapy were the most common first -line treatments (prescribed \nin 35% and 14% of the patients, respectively) resulting in a CR rate of \n48%.299 The overall estimated median disease- free survival (DFS) was \n11 months, but the DFS was longer for patients treated with phototherapy \n(23 months; P < .03). The presence of type A LyP and the use of first -line \ntreatment other than phototherapy were significantly associated with increased risk of early cutaneous relapse.  \nIn a retrospective study of 45 patients with LyP and other CD30+ PCTLD, low-dose methotrexate (≤25 mg) resulted in satisfactory disease control in \n87% of patients, and the median total duration of treatment was >39 \nmonths for all patients.\n300 After discontinuation, 25% of patients remained \nfree of disease relapse during the follow -up period of 24 to 227 months. \nAnother study that evaluated the efficacy of low -dose methotrexate in a \ncohort of 28 patients with LyP reported that satisfactory disease control could be achieved at 7.5 -mg to 10 -mg weekly doses of methotrexate.\n289  \nObservation is preferred for patients with asymptomatic disease. Topical \nsteroids or phototherapy are appropriate initial treatment options for limited \nlesions (in symptomatic patients) or extensive lesions.257,292,301- 303 In \npatients receiving phototherapy, narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) is \ngenerally preferred over psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). Systemic \ntherapy is indicated only for patients with extensive lesions. Methotrexate \nis widely used for the treatment of LyP .289,299,300,304- 309 Systemic retinoids \n(bexarotene) are included as an option based on limited available data \nmainly from case reports.291- 294 Follow -up and Treatment for Relapsed/Refractory Disease  \nPatients with a clinical benefit and/or those with disease responding to \ninitial treatment can be considered for maintenance or tapering of \nregimens to optimize response duration. Patients with disease that does \nnot have adequate response to initial treatm ent are generally treated with \nan alternative regimen recommended for initial treatment before moving on to treatment for refractory disease. Disease relapse often responds well \nto the same treatment. In patients with PC -ALCL, refractory disease to \nmultiple prior therapies should be managed with systemic therapy options \nrecommended for MF with LCT.  \nBrentuximab vedotin is included as an option for LyP that is refractory to \nmultiple primary treatment options.\n159,310 In a phase II study of 12 patients \nwith refractory LyP, brentuximab vedotin resulted in an ORR of 100% and a CR rate of 58%.\n310 The median duration of response was 20 weeks. \nGrade 1 or 2 peripheral neuropathy was the most common adverse event reported in 10 patients (83%). Further studies are needed to optimize the \ndosing to minimize the incidences of peripheral neuropathy.  \nRegular follow -up (including complete skin examination) is essential during \nobservation since these patients can develop associated hematologic \nmalignancies (particularly MF or ALCL) over time.\n299,311 Life-long follow -up \n(including thorough skin examination) is warranted for patients with LyP (even for patients with disease responding to initial treatment) due to high \nrisks for second lymphoid malignancies.  \n  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-64  \n \nSubcutaneous Panniculitis- Like T -Cell Lymphoma  \nOverview  \nSubcutaneous panniculitis -like T -cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a rare subtype \nof cutaneous T- cell lymphoma  (CTCL)  indicated by the presence of \npleomorphic cytotoxic T -cell infiltrates primarily affecting subcutaneous \ntissues.  First identified in 1991 by Gonzalez et al,1 SPTCL commonly \nfollows an indolent course consisting of  erythematous  subcutaneous  \nnodules and plaques in the lower extremities, but lesions may develop \nanywhere on the body.2-4 In unusual circumstances, adipocytes in other \nregions such as the mesentery can be affected by these malignant T- cells. \nSPTCL accounts for <1% of all non- Hodgkin lymphomas, with a 5- year \nsurvival average of 80%. Patients with SPTCL tend to be relatively \nyounger  with a slight bias for females , and may have a family  or personal  \nhistory of autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematous \n(SLE).4-7 As the clinical presentation can mimic other benign inflammatory \ndisorders, sufficient testing should be done to aid in the diagnosis .8  \nInitially, the term SPTCL represented two different entities  that were \ncategorized as  having  either αβ or γδ TCR expression, with the latter \nbeing the more aggressive phenotype. However, in  2008  the World Health \nOrganization (WHO)  reclassified and categorized SPTCL as only  SPTCL -\nαβ; the γδ TCR- positive variant is listed as primary cutaneous γδ T- cell \nlymphoma (PCGD -TCL).9 The findings  from a SEER database analysis \n(132 patients with  SPTCL and 37 patients with  PCGD- TCL diagnosed \nbetween 2006 and 2015) indicated that patients with PCGD -TCL were , on \naverage,  older, more likely to be male, and were at significantly higher risk \nof death than those with SPTCL (HR , 5.00; P = .005) .10 The αβ TCR \nphenotype is often CD4- , CD8+, and often restricted to the subcutaneous tissues, which is less common in  γδ TCR phenotype in PCGD -TCL.11,12 \nAdipocyte rimming by CD8+ T- cells alongside a high Ki -67 staining index \nis often detected specifically in SPTCL,  while  tumoral growth in bone \nmarrow or mesenchymal structures  is not typically observed.4,13  \nOccasionally, cutaneous findings/lesions can resolve with areas of \nlipodystrophy and hyperpigmentation  without medical intervention . \nSystemic B symptoms such as fever, fatigue,  excessive sweating during \nsleep,  and weight loss  are commonly reported in patients with SPTCL. \nThe disease may be complicated by  hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis \n(HLH) , which is generally associated with a more aggressive course , and \na reduced  5-year survival (~46%) .1,4,14 HLH is observed less  frequently in \nSPTCL  (~15%–25% of SPTCL cases) than in PCGD -TCL with \npanniculitis -like lesions .15 Due to complications such as HLH,  SPTCL may \nbe associated with elevated liver enzymes , splenomegaly,  and \ncytopenias.16 Treatment of 17 patients with SPTCL with HLH resulted in \nan overall response rate (ORR)  of 88%.17 In cases complicated by HLH, \ntreatment of HLH concurrently with treatment of lymphoma is \nrecommended.  \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines\n®), an electronic search of the PubMed \ndatabase was performed to obtain key literature on SPTCL published since the previous Guidelines update using the following search terms: \nsubcutaneous panniculitis -like T -cell lymphoma . The PubMed database \nwas chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes  peer-reviewed biomedical literature.\n18 \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. The data from key PubMed articles deemed as \nrelevant to these guidelines have been included in this version of the This discussion corresponds to the NCCN Guidelines for Primary Cutaneous  \nLymphomas .

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-65 Discussion section. Recommendations for which high- level evidence is \nlacking are based on the P anel’s review of lower -level evidence and \nexpert opinion.  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines® are available at www.NCCN.org .  \nDiagnosis  \nA precise diagnosis of SPTCL is challenging and requires several \nmethods to fully verify . Patients generally present with multiple painless \nerythematous nodules or plaques on the lower extremities, upper extremities, or trunk. Multiple B symptoms ( eg, fever, unintentional weight \nloss, pruritus ) may accompany the external symptoms that a patient has; \nthis is more common with HLH.\n16,19 As previously mentioned, the disease \nis commonly limited to subcutaneous tissues, but more aggressive phenotypes may rarely exhibit  dissemination into lymph nodes, peripheral \nblood,  and bone marrow  and rarely viscerally .  \nUpon initial presentation, deep subcutaneous skin biopsy (deep telescope \npunch biopsy  vs. wedge excision) with adequate amount of adipose tissue \n(multiple  skin biopsies , if necessary) and immunophenotyping is essential \nto establish an accurate  diagnosis. SPTCL is commonly CD3+, CD8+, \nβF1+, CD2+, CD5+, and CD7+.\n15,20,21  \nIn SPTCL, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD8, TCRβ, TIA -1, and granzyme are positive \nin most cases.22 CD8+ adipocyte- rimming T -cells involved in SPTCL \nfrequently express high levels of Ki -67, a feature minimally observed in \ndifferential diagnoses such as lupus erythematosus panniculitis (LEP) and \nSLE.6,22 Perforin and granzyme were present in 22 Asian patients with \nSPTCL, a common feature of malignant lymphocytes expressing \nCD8.9,23,24  Initial immunohistochemistry (IHC) panel may include TCRβ, TCRδ, CD2, \nCD3, CD20, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD30, and CD56. Additional IHC \nmarkers Ki -67, CD123, TIA1, perforin, granzyme -B, CD1a, TdT, and TCL1 \nwill be useful in certain circumstances. In situ hybridization of Epstein- Barr \nvirus -encoded RNA (EBER -ISH) is often included in the features tested \nwhen directing toward a diagnosis. In the majority of studies where a \ndiagnosis of SPTCL is confirmed, the patients were EBER -ISH \nnegative.9,13,16,25-27 EBER positivity is a potential trigger for secondary HLH \nin patients with immune -related disease, and thus should be included in \ndiagnostic procedures.  \nMolecular analysis to detect  TCR gene rearrangements or other \nassessment of clonality are recommended to identify the clonality of T-  \ncells.22,28 Recurrent mutations in genes involved in epigenetic modification \n(KMT2C  and KMT2D ), and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway ( PLCG1  and \nARID1B ) have been identified in SPTCL.22,29  \nAn inherited autosomal recessive condition characterized by SPTCL with \nHLH resulting from HAVCR2 deficiency can lead to unregulated immune \ncell activation. HAVCR2 , which codes for T -cell immunoglobulin and TIM -\n3, is an immune checkpoint that functions with programmed cell death \nprotein 1  (PD-1) and LAG3 to mediate CD8+ T -cell exhaustion.24,30 A \ngermline mutation in TIM -3, specifically p.Tyr82Cys, represents a well -\ndocumented genetic alteration that induces increased protein aggregation, \na metabolic consequence in patients with immune diseases such as \nSPTCL.24,31 Of note, this mutation is more prevalent in patients of Asian \nancestry. Significant changes in TIM -3 expression are associated with \nHLH, refractory disease, and severe disease, which account for nearly \n20% of all SPTCL cases.14,15,32 Generally, TIM -3–mutant SPTCL cases are \ncontrolled by immunosuppression. HAVCR2  mutation is a useful marker \nthat may aid in distinguishing SPTCL from non -malignant differential \ndiagnoses and treatment decisions.33 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-66 Workup  \nInitial examination of patients with suspected TCLs  such as SPTCL will \ngenerally consist of a thorough skin examination and palpations of \nabdominal organs as well as lymph node regions to check for any potential \nmasses or growth. If a patient has a personal or family history of \nimmunologic diseases includi ng autoimmunity, genomic profiling, \nantinuclear antibody (ANA) with reflex, rheumatoid factor (RF), thyroid-\nstimulating hormone (TSH), and primary immunodeficiency (PID) gene \npanel s may help to narrow down the diagnosis. A single positive result for \nany of these individual markers does not necessarily rule out SPTCL. \nHowever, an  assessment  for predispositions to autoimmune diseases is \ncrucial to identify other conditions that can be mistaken for  SPTCL .  \nBlood tests (eg , complete blood count  [CBC] with differential) can reveal \nthe relative number of relevant immune cells and markers , since  there are  \nmany  that exist that can point toward a more precise diagnosis. Markers \nsuch as lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH)  and ferritin are usually  higher than \nnormal when there is HLH involved in SPTCL. The Histiocyte Society \noutlines eight diagnostic criteria that include ferritin elevation34 and serum \nLDH,  which  are also commonly elevated in patients with SPTCL.16,35 \nBone marrow biopsy is important for the workup of suspected HLH or \nunexplained cytopenias.26 Peripheral blood flow cytometry can be \nconsidered to rule out the diagnosis of other TCL subtypes . However,  \nSPTCL is not typically associated with peripheral blood involvement . \nPET/CT scans are routinely utilized to assess the extent of disease, \ndetermine the stage, and identify disease locations. 18F -\nfluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET/CT is used before and after treatment . Of \n63 individuals who underwent PET/CT or CT, a bnormal findings  were \npresent in 59 individuals  (94%), revealing considerable involvement of \nsubcutaneous fat. Additionally,  avid adenopathy was reported in 23 (37%) of these individuals.4 In a retrospective study of 11 patients with SPTCL , \nPET/CT  revealed lesions with varying  morphologies from multiple \nsubcutaneous nodules .36 FDG uptake was variable within each patient and \namong all lesions. Though diagnosis of SPTCL is reliant on \nmultiparameter IHC, PET/CT has utility in diagnostic confirmation and \ndirection of biopsy  of enlarged lymph nodes or other suspected FDG -avid \nextracutaneous sites .36-38 Whole body FDG -PET/CT scan can be used to \nassess the extent of subcutaneous involvement and exclude systemic \ninvolvement.  \nTreatment Options  \nSince SPTCL is a rare subtype of lymphoma, there are not much data  \nfrom large prospective trials  to support a standardized treatment regimen \nor protocol.  There are, however, several small studies and case reports \nthat have helped illustrate some pathways for clinicians to treat patients \nwith SPTCL.  Published reports and studies have shown that treatment \noptions for SPTCL vary widely in their dosing, efficacy, and responses , \nwhich is reflective of staging and diagnostic discrepancies . As mentioned \npreviously, obtaining an accurate diagnosis and developing a treatment plan for patients with SPTCL is challenging, and requires more studies \nwith extensive data . \nWhile chemotherapy may be considered for patients presenting with HLH, \nimmunomodulatory therapies are considered for patients who present \nwithout HLH.  \nA comparison of immunosuppressive drugs (n  = 16) and \npolychemotherapy (n = 7) for SPTCL revealed that patients who received \npolychemotherapy showed a significantly lower complete response ( CR) \nrate (28%) when compared to those receiving immunosuppressive drugs \n(81%).\n20 The polychemotherapy regimens used were either CHOEP \n(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone) PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-67 or CHOP  (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) -\nrelated chemotherapy, while the immunosuppressive drugs given were \ncorticosteroid alone or low -dose methotrexate, cyclosporine A ( CsA), and \nhydroxychloroquine. These results were similar to Guitart et al who reported that patients with SPTCL receiving immunomodulatory therapies \nhad comparable or better ORR than chemotherapy regimens.\n4 The ORR s \nof CsA, methotrexate, bexarotene, and systemic steroids were 94%, 58%, \n25%, and 33%, respectively. Further treatment regimens were required in \npatients with progressive SPTCL. The study concluded that \nimmunomodulatory regimens could be beneficial prior to  aggressive \ntherapy with etoposide- containing chemotherapy regimens.  \nChemotherapy -free regimens containing immunomodulatory drugs seem \nto result in improved disease control rates (compared to treatment with \nsubsequent lines of chemotherapy) in patients with relapsed or refractory \ndisease after first - and second- line chemotherapy.39,40   \nLimited available data on the use of immunomodulatory drugs and other \nsingle agents as treatment options for SPTCL are discussed below.  \nCyclosporine A  \nCsA has been used successfully as both first - and second- line treatment \nfor SPTCL. Several case studies of patients with SPTCL with  and without  \nHLH revealed that CsA was effective with minimal side effects and a \nsustained CR , regardless of previous treatments and responses to \ntreatments .41-48 In 11 patients  with SPTCL receiving CsA, 6 achieved \nprogression- free survival ( PFS)  ranging from 9 to 24 months.41-43,47 CsA in \ncombination with oral steroids in patients with SPTCL can control and \noccasionally eliminate disease with low probability of relapse.27 Prior to \nsingle - or multi -agent chemotherapy, CsA may be an effective option, \nincluding in cases with early signs of HLH.  Bexarotene \nBexarotene, an oral  retinoid used for CTCL, has been shown to be \neffective at treating patients with SPTCL with an ORR of 82% (11/13) in SPTCL.\n49 Durable responses were observed in several patients at 5 7, 58, \nand 92  months, with a median duration of response of 26 months, and the \nmedian PFS of 38 months. In patients who received bexarotene as \nmaintenance therapy following remission to chemotherapy, the effect of \nbexarotene alone cannot be established.  \nPralatrexate  \nPralatrexate has been used as a treatment for SPTCL- refractory \nchemotherapy regimens and immune suppressants. In a study of patients with SPTCL who had between two to four previous lines of therapy, \npralatrexate treatment led to a CR in two patients, with the other two \npatients requiring further intervention.\n50 In a recent study involving  patients \ndiagnosed with various cytotoxic CTCLs , seven individuals with SPTCL \nreceived pralatrexate as a single- agent therapy, resulting in a median time \nto next treatment  (TTNT)  of 18 months.51 Pralatrexate was also successful \nas a bridging therapy to allogeneic HCT in selected patients. As a  \nsubsequent  treatment for a patient with SPTCL refractory to \nchemotherapy, CsA, and allogeneic HCT , but without HLH, pralatrexate \ninduced metabolic remission for > 18 months.52 As a single agent, \npralatrexate may be considered as a first -line treatment option, an  \nadditional therapy for those with progressive disease, or as a maintenance \ntherapy for those who have achieved a CR.  \nMethotrexate \nAmong 14 patients with SPTCL,  treatment  with methotrexate resulted in a \nresponse rate of 58% (five patients with a CR and two patients with a \npartial response [ PR]).4 In the same study, all patients without HLH had a \npositive response to methotrexate as a first -line therapy. Alongside \nprednisone, methotrexate helped a patient with SPTCL achieve remission \nfor >21 months.53 Combination of oral steroids and methotrexate or CsA PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-68 led to a CR of 85% among 16 patients with SPTCL, and was associated \nwith an estimated 5 -year disease- specific survival of 88% .27 \nRomidepsin  \nThe efficacy of histone deacetylase inhibitor s such as  romidepsin as a \npotential treatment option for SPTCL has been demonstrated in case \nreports .54,55,56 In the first case report,  romidepsin was administered at \nstandard dosing following the development of increased systemic \nsymptoms with oral prednisone in one patient . After three cycles, all \nsymptoms disappeared, with complete resolution of metabolic foci  in \nsubcutaneous tissue by PET/ CT. Disease progression after prednisone \nand bexarotene led to treatment  with romidepsin for two cycles  in the \nsecond patient . A CR was seen upon PET/ CT. Romidepsin was employed \nto treat SPTCL refractory to prednisone, methotrexate, bexarotene, \nhydroxychloroquine, and acitretin.56 After starting romidepsin, 50% of \nnodules disappeared. The patient achieved a CR at 12 months, and \ntreatment was discontinued at 18 months. No evidence of disease \nprogression was reported. In a later study, two patients, one with SPTCL \nand the other with PCGD -TCL, received romidepsin among other \ntreatments.54 The patient with SPTCL remained in CR ( median follow -up \nof 5 years ) with no evidence of disease recurrence,  while the patient with \nPCGD- TCL experienced disease progression after romidepsin treatment.  \nMore recently, among 22 patients with SPTCL, nine received romidepsin \nas a single agent, resulting in a median TTNT of 10 months.51  \nChemotherapy  \nOptimal first- line combination chemotherapy in patients with SPTCL has \nbeen widely debated since SPTCL was classified as its own disease. In selected patients requiring chemotherapy, combination chemotherapy \nregimens have resulted in favorable response rat es.\n4,12,57  \nIn a large retrospective analysis of 75 patients with SPTCL, 73 received \nchemotherapy, many of which contained etoposide (eg, CHOEP [cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide,  and prednisone];  \nICE [ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide] ; SMILE [dexamethasone, \nmethotrexate, ifosfamide, and etoposide] ; CDE [cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, and etoposide] ; and CMED [cyclophosphamide, etoposide, \nmethotrexate, and dexamethasone]).4 The ORR for the entire cohort was \n72%, with 47% achieving a CR and 22% achieving a PR. \nIn several instances, SPTCL becomes refractory after treatment with \nCHOP and alternative interventions with CsA41 or hematopoietic cell \ntransplant (HCT) are needed for the treatment of refractory disease.\n46,54,58,59 The presence of HAVCR2  mutations also confers \nresistance to CHOP chemotherapy, necessitating  subsequent  treatment \nwith immunosuppressive regimens  or HCT.31  \nHematopoietic C ell Transplant  \nHCT may be an  effective treatment option for SPTCL, especially in \npatients with progressive or refractory disease after first- line systemic \ntherapy .46,60 Mou et al reported that in five patients with SPTCL with HLH \nwho underwent allogeneic HCT, all of them were alive after a median \nfollow- up of 3 years.51 Autologous  HCT was also successful at treating \naggressive SPTCL with HLH in various  case reports .58,61,62,63 HCT has led \nto durable remissions in patients with SPTCL with HLH (range 30– 132 \nmonths) and an equivalent 3 -year survival (80%) when compared to \npatients with SPTCL without H LH.62 A similar result was seen in a patient \nwith B cell expansion with NF- κB and T- cell anergy (BENTA) disease who \ndeveloped SPTCL. The patient required an autologous HCT  for \nprogressive disease after multiple treatment regimens .48   \nNCCN Recommendations \nTreatment options outlined in the NCCN Guidelines for patients with \nSPTCL are based on the presence of HLH and the extent of tumor burden  \n(limited or localized vs . widespread subcutaneous disease).

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025  \nPrimary Cutaneous Lymphomas  \n \nMS-69 SPTCL with HLH, S ystemic Disease, or H igh Tumor Burden (W idespread \nSubcutaneous Disease)  \nFirst-Line Therapy  \nSingle agents (CsA, pralatrexate,  or romidepsin) with or without \nprednisone or etoposide- based combination chemotherapy regimens  can \nbe considered as options for first -line therapy.4,51 It is recommended to \nstart with etoposide -based regimens to control HLH first and then move to \ndisease- specific therapies. Oral CsA is typically initiated at 3 –5 mg/kg/day \nin divided doses.41-43 Dose adjustment is based on response and \ntolerance. Higher dosage may be necessary to achieve disease control.  \nInvolved- site radiation therapy  (ISRT) can be considered for single lesion \nor limited disease with or without symptoms or HLH.  \nEtoposide- based c ombination chemotherapy regimens including CHOEP, \nor DA-EPOCH ( dose -adjusted etoposide,  prednisone,  vincristine, \ncyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin)  or ESHA (etoposide, \nmethylprednisolone, and high- dose cytarabine) + cisplatin or oxaliplatin or \nICE are also appropriate options for patients who are eligible for \ntransplant.4 \nResponse Assessment and Additional Therapy  \nDepending on the response to first -line therapy (CR  or PR), options such \nas observation or single- agent maintenance therapy (CsA, pralatrexate, \nromidepsin, methotrexate, or bexarotene) are recommended.49,50,52,55 Most \npatients will achieve a PR after first- line therapy, with a CR being less \ncommon. Generally, maintenance therapy is utilized for patients with \ndisease who achieve some clinical benefit and/or those with disease \nresponding to first -line therapy. Additionally, if a more marked response is \nseen, tapering of regimens to optimize duration of response is feasible. Select patients with SPTCL may be candidates for allogeneic HCT, \ndepending on response to first -line therapy .\n60,62 Patients who do not \nachieve an adequate response to first -line therapy may be given a different first- line therapy or the same therapy at a higher dose to achieve \ndisease control.41,46 \nPatients with disease relapse (after a period of observation or \nmaintenance therapy)  should receive treatment  with either the same \nregimen previously given or an alternate regimen that was not given as \nfirst-line therapy.  Patients with disease relapse or refractory disease after \nmultiple prior therapies may be recommended to enroll in clinical trials or \nto consider allogeneic HC T (if eligible) .54,58,62 \nSPTCL Without HLH and Low Tumor Burden (L ocalized or L imited \nSubcutaneous Disease)  \nFirst-Line Therapy  \nSingle agents (CsA, methotrexate,  or bexarotene), with or without \nprednisone, can be considered as options for first -line therapy.4,27,47,53 As \nmentioned above for SPTCL with HLH , CsA is typically initiated at 3 –5 \nmg/kg/day in divided doses. It may be necessary to increase the dose to \nachieve disease control. Dose adjustment is based on response and \ntolerance. ISRT can be considered as a local therapy for single lesion or \nlimited disease with and without symptoms of HLH.  \nResponse Assessment and Additional Therapy  \nDepending on the response to first -line therapy (CR  or PR), options such \nas observation or single- agent maintenance therapy (CsA, pralatrexate, \nromidepsin, methotrexate, or bexarotene) are recommended .4,49,50,52,55 \nRegarding CsA,  gradual  tapering or  continuation as  maintenance can be \nconsidered for patients with disease responding  to first- line therapy. If \nsingle -agent therapy  results in  clinical benefits or adequate response to \nfirst-line therapy, the single- agent therapy may be gradually  tapered to \noptimize duration of response or used as maintenance therapy.  \nPatients who do not achieve an adequate response to first -line therapy \nmay be given a different first -line therapy or a local therapy (if not given as PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:58 PM.
