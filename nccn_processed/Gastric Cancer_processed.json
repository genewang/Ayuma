Immunohistochemistry/in situ hybridization/targeted PCR should be considered first for the identification \nof biomarkers, followed by NGS testing. If limited tissue is available, or the patient is unable to undergo a traditional biopsy , sequential testing of \nsingle biomarkers/limited molecular diagnostic panels will exhaust the sample. In these scenarios, or at the discretion of the treating physician, \ncomprehensive genomic profiling via a validated NGS assay performed in a CLIA-approved laboratory should be considered.  \nIHC/ISH/targeted PCR is the preferred approach to assess biomarkers, initially. However, NGS testing through a CLIA-approved laboratory may be \nconsidered later in the clinical course of patients with sufficient tumor tissue available for testing . \n\u0017PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry\n• Liquid Biopsy revised: The genomic alterations of solid cancers may be identified by evaluating circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood, hence \na form of “liquid biopsy.” Liquid biopsy is being used more frequently in patients with advanced disease, particularly those who are unable to have \na clinical biopsy for disease surveillance and management.  The detection of mutations/alterations or fusions in DNA shed from gastric carcinomas \ncan identify targetable alterations or the evolution of clones with altered treatment response profiles. Therefore, when limited tissue is available or  for \npatients who have metastatic or advanced gastric cancer who may be unable  are not able  to undergo a traditional biopsy , or for disease progression \nmonitoring , testing using a validated NGS-based comprehensive genomic profiling assay performed in a CLIA-approved laboratory may be considered. \nA negative result should be interpreted with caution, as this does not exclude the presence of tumor mutations or amplifications.\nGAST-C 4 of 5\n• Palliative Procedures: Gastric resections should be reserved for the palliation of symptoms (eg, obstruction or uncontrollable bleeding) in patients with \nincurable disease when non-surgical options are not feasible such as endoscopic or interventional radiology procedures  \n(ie, endoscopic stenting) .PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

Thus, an adequate endoscopic exam addresses both of these components. The location of the tumor in \nthe stomach (cardia, fundus, body, antrum, and pylorus) and relative to the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) for proximal tumors should be \ncarefully recorded to assist with treatment planning and follow-up examinations.  \n• Multiple (6–8) biopsies using standard size endoscopy forceps should be performed to provide adequately sized material for histologic and \nmolecular interpretation, especially in the setting of an ulcerated lesion.1,2 Larger forceps may improve the yield.  \n• Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) can be performed in the evaluation of small lesions. \nEMR or ESD of focal nodules ≤2 cm can be safely performed to provide a larger specimen that can be better assessed by the pathologist, \nproviding greater information on degree of differentiation, the presence of lymphovascular invasion (L VI), and the depth of infiltration, \nthereby providing accurate T-staging.3 Such excisional biopsies have the potential of being therapeutic.4\nStaging\n• EUS performed prior to any treatment is important in the initial clinical staging of gastric cancer.5 Careful attention to ultrasound images \nprovides evidence of depth of tumor invasion (T-category), presence of abnormal or enlarged lymph nodes likely to harbor cancer \n(N-assessment), and occasionally signs of distant spread, such as lesions in surrounding organs (M-category) or the presence of ascites.6 \nThis is especially important in patients who are being considered for ER (EMR or ESD).7 \n• Hypoechoic (dark) expansion of the gastric wall layers identifies the location of tumor , with gradual loss of the layered pattern of the normal \nstomach wall corresponding with greater depths of tumor penetration, correlating with higher T-categories. A dark expansion of layers 1–3 \ncorresponds with infiltration of the superficial and deep mucosa plus the submucosal, T1 disease. A dark expansion of layers 1–4 correlates \nwith penetration into the muscularis propria, T2 disease, and expansion beyond the muscularis propria resulting in an irregular outer border \nthat correlates with invasion of the subserosa, T3 disease. Loss of the bright line recognized as the serosa is now staged as pT4a, and \nextension of the mass into surrounding organs such as the liver, pancreas, and spleen is staged as pT4b disease.\n• Perigastric lymph nodes are readily seen by EUS, and the identification of enlarged, hypoechoic (dark), homogeneous, well-circumscribed, \nrounded structures around the stomach correlates with the presence of malignant or inflammatory lymph nodes. The accuracy of this \ndiagnosis is significantly increased with the combination of features, but also may be confirmed with the use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) \nbiopsy for cytology assessment.8 FNA of suspicious lymph nodes should be performed if it can be achieved without traversing an area \nof primary tumor or major blood vessels, and if it will impact treatment decisions. Furthermore, an attempt should be made to identify the \npresence of ascites and FNA should be considered to rule out peritoneal spread of disease.\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

En-bloc excision of small gastric lesions by ESD has been shown to be more effective than EMR in \ncuring small early-stage gastric cancer, but requires greater skills and instrumentation to perform and has a significant risk of complications \nincluding perforation.11  \n• Japanese Gastric Cancer guidelines recommend that EMR or ESD should be considered for early-stage gastric cancer lesions ≤2 cm in \ndiameter without associated ulcer formation.3   \n• Several Japanese and American guidelines have expanded the indications for ESD to include: \n\u0017Well to moderately differentiated cancer of any size, without ulceration \n\u0017Well or moderately differentiated with submucosal (sm) layer invasion <500 micrometers \n\u0017Well or moderately differentiated <3 cm with ulceration\n\u0017Poorly differentiated <2 cm without ulceration \n• This may potentially be considered curative resection if the margins are negative, there is no LVI, and curative resection is limited to \nsm1. However, there is still a very small risk of lymph node involvement, so such decisions should be made following multidisciplinary \ndiscussions and careful explanation to the patient.\n• EMR or ESD of gastric cancers that are poorly differentiated, harbor evidence of L VI, invade into the deep submucosa, or have positive \nlateral or deep margins or lymph node metastases should be considered to be incomplete. Additional therapy by gastrectomy with \nlymphadenectomy should be considered.12\n• EUS performed after chemotherapy or radiation therapy (RT) has a reduced ability to accurately determine the post-treatment stage of \ndisease.13 Similarly, biopsies performed after chemotherapy or RT may not accurately diagnose the presence of residual disease but still \nprovide useful information.14\n• Endoscopic tumor ablation can be performed for the short-term control of bleeding. Endoscopic insertion of expandable metal stents \nis effective in long-term relief of tumor obstruction at the EGJ or the gastric outlet, although surgical gastrojejunostomy may be more \nefficacious for those with longer-term survival ( Principles of Palliative Care/Best Supportive Care [GAST-J]).15,16\n• Long-term palliation of anorexia, dysphagia, or malnutrition may be achieved with endoscopic- or radiographic-assisted placement of \na feeding gastrostomy tube in carefully selected cases where the distal stomach is uninvolved by tumor, or the placement of a feeding \njejunostomy tube (J-tube).17\nPost-Treatment Surveillance\n• Endoscopic surveillance following definitive treatment of gastric cancer requires careful attention to detail for mucosal surface changes, \nand multiple (4–6) biopsies of any visualized abnormalities. Strictures should be biopsied to rule out neoplastic cause. EUS performed \nin conjunction with endoscopy exams has a high sensitivity for detecting recurrent disease.18 EUS-guided FNA should be performed if \nsuspicious lymph nodes or areas of wall thickening are seen.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

A companion diagnostic test should be used on FFPE tissue as an aid in \nidentifying patients for treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. PD-L1 testing should be performed only in CLIA-approved laboratories.  \n• Assessment of PD-L1 Protein Expression in Gastric Cancers \n\u0017This is a qualitative IHC assay using anti-PD-L1 antibodies for the detection of PD-L1 protein in FFPE tissues from gastric adenocarcinoma. \nA minimum of 100 tumor cells must be present in the PD-L1-stained slide for the specimen to be considered adequate for PD-L1 evaluation. \nA specimen is considered to have PD-L1 expression if the combined positive score (CPS) is ≥1. CPS is the number of PD-L1 staining cells \n(ie, tumor cells, lymphocytes, macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells, multiplied by 100. \nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

Therefore, when limited tissue is available or for patients who have metastatic \nor advanced gastric cancer who are not able to undergo a traditional biopsy, testing using a validated NGS-based comprehensive genomic \nprofiling assay performed in a CLIA-approved laboratory may be considered. A negative result should be interpreted with caution, as this \ndoes not exclude the presence of tumor.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

If laparoscopy is planned as a separate \nprocedure, peritoneal washings with cytology should be performed as well.\n• In patients receiving preoperative therapy, a baseline laparoscopy along with peritoneal washings should be considered.\n• Positive peritoneal cytology (performed in the absence of visible peritoneal implants) is associated with poor prognosis and is defined as \npM1 disease.2\nSiewert Classification\n• Siewert tumor type should be assessed in all patients with adenocarcinomas involving the EGJ.3,4\n\u0017Siewert Type I: adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus (often associated with Barrett esophagus) with the epicenter located within 1 cm to \n5 cm above the anatomic EGJ.\n\u0017Siewert Type II: true carcinoma of the cardia at the EGJ, with the tumor epicenter within 1 cm above and 2 cm below the EGJ.\n\u0017Siewert Type III: subcardial carcinoma with the tumor epicenter between 2 cm and 5 cm below the EGJ, which infiltrates the EGJ and lower \nesophagus from below.\n• The treatment of Siewert types I and II is as described in the NCCN Guidelines for Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers .  \n• Siewert type III lesions are considered gastric cancers, and thus should be treated as described in the NCCN Guidelines for Gastric Cancer . \nIn some cases additional esophageal resection may be needed in order to obtain adequate margins.3,5,6\nCriteria of Unresectability for Cure\n• Locoregionally advanced\n\u0017Disease infiltration of the root of the mesentery or para-aortic lymph node highly suspicious on imaging or confirmed by biopsy\n\u0017Invasion or encasement of major vascular structures (excluding the splenic vessels)\n• Distant metastasis or peritoneal seeding (including positive peritoneal cytology)\nContinued\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

There are no randomized trials to demonstrate efficacy, and results are limited to \ncase reports and small series. However, IC/HIPEC may be effective in selected patients with low burden of tumor. The decision to pursue IC/\nHIPEC should be made only after multidisciplinary discussion.\n\u0017PIPAC is investigational and should only be done in the context of a clinical trial.\n\u0017IC/HIPEC may be a therapeutic alternative for carefully selected patients with peritoneal carcinoma as only disease.\n ◊Patients who are being considered for IC/HIPEC should undergo pre-treatment evaluation with a chest/abdomen/pelvis CT, diagnostic \nlaparoscopy with washings to assess for PCI and/or cytology-positive disease, and consider a PET scan to rule out distant metastatic \ndisease. Patients with documented peritoneal metastatic disease should begin with systemic therapy given for a minimum of 3 months. \nThen patients should undergo re-staging and demonstrate stable or improving disease to be considered for further therapy. Treatment \ndecisions should be made in the context of a multidisciplinary tumor board. In this setting:\n –IC/HIPEC can be used in conjunction with cytoreductive surgerya for patients with low PCI (≤10) who are candidates to undergo \ncomplete cytoreduction. \n –In patients with a higher burden of peritoneal disease (PCI >10), IC/HIPEC may be considered in the setting of a clinical trial. \n –The role of prophylactic IC/HIPEC/PIPAC is currently investigational for patients with non-metastatic cancers and should only be \nperformed in the setting of a clinical trial. \nReferencesa Cytoreduction of all visible nodules/plaques.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

N Engl J Med 2001;345:725-730.Category 1 evidence supports the notion that the combined modality therapy is effective for patients with localized esophagogastric \ncancer.1,2,3 The NCCN Panel believes in an infrastructure that encourages multidisciplinary treatment decision-making by members of all \ndisciplines taking care of this group of patients.\nThe combined modality therapy for patients with localized esophagogastric cancer may be optimally delivered when the following elements \nare in place:\n• The involved institution and individuals from relevant disciplines are committed to jointly reviewing the detailed data on patients on a regular \nbasis. Frequent meetings (either once a week or once every 2 weeks) are encouraged.  \n• Optimally at each meeting, all relevant disciplines should be encouraged to participate and these may include: surgical oncology , medical \noncology, gastroenterology, radiation oncology, radiology, and pathology. In addition, the presence of nutritional services, social workers, \nnursing, palliative care specialists, and other supporting disciplines are also desirable.  \n• All long-term therapeutic strategies are best developed after adequate staging procedures are completed, but ideally prior to any therapy \nthat is rendered. \n• Joint review of the actual medical data is more effective than reading reports for making sound therapy decisions.  \n \n• A brief documentation of the consensus recommendation(s) by the multidisciplinary team for an individual patient may prove useful.  \n• The recommendations made by the multidisciplinary team may be considered advisory to the primary group of treating physicians of the \nparticular patient. \n• Re-presentation of select patient outcomes after therapy is rendered may be an effective educational method for the entire multidisciplinary \nteam. \n• A periodic formal review of relevant literature during the course of the multidisciplinary meeting is highly encouraged.PRINCIPLES OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM APPROACH FOR ESOPHAGOGASTRIC CANCERSPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

The use of three cytotoxic drugs in \na regimen should be reserved for patients who are medically fit with excellent PS and easy access to frequent toxicity evaluations.\n• Modifications of category 1 regimen or use of category 2A or 2B regimens may be preferred (as indicated), with evidence supporting a more \nfavorable toxicity profile without compromising efficacy.1\n• Doses and schedules for any regimen that is not derived from category 1 evidence are a suggestion, and are subject to appropriate \nmodifications depending on the circumstances.\n• Alternate combinations and schedules of cytotoxics based on the availability of the agents, practice preferences, and contraindications are \npermitted.\n• Perioperative systemic therapy2,3 is a category 1 recommendation for localized gastric cancer. \n• Postoperative chemotherapy plus chemoradiation4 is an alternative option for patients who received less than a D2 lymph node dissection.\n• Postoperative chemotherapy is recommended following primary D2 lymph node dissection5,6 (see Principles of Surgery [GAST-C]).\n• In the adjuvant setting, upon completion of systemic therapy or chemoradiation, patients should be monitored for any long-term therapy-\nrelated complications.  \n• An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines.\n• A checkpoint inhibitor should be added to first-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced disease with PD-L1 CPS ≥1. \n• Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is not approved for concurrent use with IV ipilimumab; however , for nivolumab monotherapy, nivolumab \nand hyaluronidase-nvhy subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV nivolumab.

Depending on the \nclinical situation, Siewert III tumors may be more appropriately managed with RT guidelines applicable to either esophageal and EGJ or \ngastric cancers. These recommendations may be modified depending on the location of the bulk of the tumor .\n• Image guidance may be used appropriately to enhance clinical targeting. \nSimulation and Treatment Planning\n• CT simulation and conformal treatment planning should be used with either three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) or \nintensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).\n• The patient should be instructed to avoid intake of a heavy meal for 3 hours before simulation and treatment. When clinically appropriate, IV \nand/or oral contrast for CT simulation may be used to aid in target localization.\n• Use of an immobilization device is strongly recommended for reproducibility of daily setup. \n• It is optimal to treat patients in the supine position as the setup is generally more stable and reproducible. \n• Four-dimensional (4D)-CT planning or other motion management may be appropriately utilized in select circumstances where organ motion \nwith respiration may be significant. \n• Target volumes need to be carefully defined and encompassed while designing IMRT plans. Uncertainties from variations in stomach filling \nand respiratory motion should be taken into account.PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPYPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

Therefore, after 5 years additional follow-up may be considered based on risk factors and comorbidities.\n•  Differences in follow-up for early-stage gastric cancer reflect a heterogeneous potential for relapse and overall survival.2-11 Whereas \nR0-resected Tis disease has a prognosis that approximates a non-cancer cohort, T1aN0 and T1b disease do not have such a favorable \nprognosis. Thus, recommendations vary according to the depth of invasion and treatment modality.\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

For gastric cancer, interventions undertaken to relieve major \nsymptoms may result in prolongation of life. This appears to be particularly true when a multimodality interdisciplinary approach is pursued, \nand, therefore, a multimodality interdisciplinary approach to palliative care of the patient with gastric cancer is encouraged.b\nBleeding\n• Acute bleeding is common in patients with gastric cancer and may directly arise from the tumor or as a consequence of therapy. Patients \nwith acute severe bleeding (hematemesis or melena) should undergo prompt endoscopic assessment.1\n\u0017Endoscopic Treatment\n ◊The efficacy of endoscopic therapy for bleeding in patients with gastric cancer is not well studied.2 The limited data suggest that while \nendoscopic therapies may initially be effective, the rate of recurrent bleeding is very high.3\n ◊Widely available treatment options include injection therapy, mechanical therapy (eg, endoscopic clips), ablative therapy (eg, argon \nplasma coagulation), or a combination of methods.\n\u0017Interventional Radiology \n ◊Angiographic embolization techniques may be useful in those situations where endoscopy is not helpful or bleeding occurs.\n\u0017Palliative gastrectomy in select patients\n• Chronic blood loss from gastric cancer\n\u0017Although proton pump inhibitors can be prescribed to reduce bleeding risk from gastric cancer , there are no definite data supporting its \nuse at this time.\n\u0017External beam RT (EBRT) has been shown to effectively manage acute and chronic GI bleeding in multiple small series.4,5\na NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care .\nb For patients who have immune-mediated toxicity, see the NCCN Guidelines for Management of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities .\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-2 Overview  \nThe incidence of gastric cancer ha s decreased substantially in the United \nStates and Western Europe over the past several decades.1-4 However, \ngastric cancer still constitutes a major global health problem , especially in \nEast Asian count ries.5,6 Globally, there were more than 968 ,000 new \ncases  resulting in approximately 660,000 deaths in 2022, making gastric \ncancer the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fifth  leading \ncause of cancer -related deaths in the world.7,8 The global  incidence of \ngastric cancer shows wide geographic variation, with a 15 - to 20-fold \ndifference between high-  and low -incidence regions.1 The highest gastric \ncancer incidence rates occur in Northeast Asia, South and Central \nAmerica, and Eastern Europe.5,6 Rates are particularly high in Japan and \nKorea, where gastric cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in males , and in China, where gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer -\nrelated mortality.\n5,6,9 In contrast, gastric cancer is one of the least \ncommonly diagnosed cancers in Western Europe , sub-Saharan Africa, \nAustralia , and North America.6 Based on SEER data for 2024, gastric \ncancer is the 1 5th most commonly diagnosed cancer and the 15th leading \ncause of cancer -related death in the United States.4 In the United States  \nfor 2025,  an estimated 30,300 people will be diagnosed and 10,780 \npeople are expected to die of this disease .10 Despite overall declining \nrates, evidence suggests that the incidence of early -onset gastric cancer \nmay be rising in the United States  and other western countries .11,12 A \nrecent global meta -analysis suggests factors  that may contribute to risk of \nearly -onset gastric cancer include family history , Helicobacter pylori ,  \ninfection, and diet .13  \nOver 95% of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas,  which are typically \nclassified based on anatomic location (cardia/proximal or non-\ncardia/distal) and histologic type (diffuse or intestinal).3 The diffuse type, \nwhich is characterized by poorly differentiated and dis cohesive tumor cells \nwith a signet -ring or non- signet -ring morphology diffusely infiltrating the gastric wall in a desmoplastic stroma, is more prevalent in low -risk areas \nand is mostly associated with heritable genetic abnormalities .3,9,14- 16 The \nintestinal type, which tends to form a mass lesion and is characterized by variably differentiated tumor cells arranged in a tubular or glandular \npattern with scattered goblet cells present , occurs more frequently in high-\nrisk areas and accounts for most of the geographic variation seen with this disease. Intestinal type gastric cancer is often related to environmental \nfactors such as H. pylori infection, tobacco smoking, high salt intake,  and \nother dietary factors.\n2,3,9,14- 16 However, the role of alcohol as a risk factor \nfor gastric cancer is without consensus . While the results of several \nmeta -analyses have shown no appreciable association between light or \nmoderate alcohol consumption and gastric cancer risk, they show ed a \npositive association between heavy alcohol use and gastric cancer, \nparticularly non -cardia gastric cancer.17-20  \nA dramatic shift in the type and location of upper gastrointestinal ( GI) tract \ntumors has occurred in North America  and Europe.2,21,22 There has been a \nmarked decline in intestinal type gastric cancers of the distal stomach in \nNorth American and Western European countries over the past several \ndecades, mainly due to enhanced access to clean drinking water , \nimproved food preservation, an average diet with low promotion of gastric \ncancer, and H. pylori  eradication.1,3,16,23 However, incidence rates of \ndiffuse type gastric cancer of the proximal stomach are rising.1,3,23 The \netiology of this increase remains elusive and may be multifactorial. In \ncontrast to the incidence trends in high income countries , tumors of the \ndistal stomach continue to predominate in low and middle income \ncountries.23 Gastric cancer generally carries a poor prognosis since it is \noften diagnosed at an advanced stage.  In Japan and South Korea, where \npopulation screening is performed widely, early detection often results in \nimproved outcomes .1,6 In the United States , survival rates from gastric \ncancer remain poor  as early detection continues to pose a major challenge \nfor health care professionals.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-3 Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update \nMethodology  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines \n(NCCN Guidelines®) for Gastric Cancer, an electronic search of the \nPubMed database was performed to obtain key literature published since \nthe last Guidelines update, using the following search terms: gastric \ncancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, and stomach cancer. The PubMed \ndatabase was chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for \nmedical literature and indexes peer reviewed biomedical literature.  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; \nGuideline;  Practice Guideline;  Randomized Controlled Trial; \nMeta -Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles selected by the P anel for review during \nthe Guidelines update meeting as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines and discussed by the P anel have \nbeen included in this version of the Discussion section (eg, e -publications \nahead of print, meeting abstracts). Recommendations for which high -level \nevidence is lacking are based on the P anel’s review of lower -level \nevidence and expert opinion.  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at www.nccn.org\n.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.24 NCCN Guidelines endeavor  to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  NCCN Guidelines  incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men , women , female, and male  when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender  from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nHereditary Cancer Predisposition Syndromes Associated \nwith Gastric Cancer  \nWhile most gastric cancers are considered sporadic, it is estimated that \n1% to 3% of gastric cancers are associated with inherited cancer \npredisposition syndromes. These  syndromes  include hereditary diffuse \ngastric cancer, Lynch syndrome,  juvenile polyposis syndrome, and familial \nadenomatous polyposis syndrome.  See the NCCN Guidelines for \nGenetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Colorectal, Endometrial, and \nGastric  (available at www.nccn.org ) for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer \ntesting, CDH1 risk assessment, and more information on these \nsyndromes.   \nStaging   \nThe tumor (T), node (N), and metastasis (M) staging system used by the \nAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC) is the internationally \naccepted standard for cancer staging and is a major factor influencing prognosis and treatment decisions.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-4 cancer presented in the Eighth Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging \nManual include clinical staging (cTNM; newly diagnosed, not -yet-treated \npatients), pathologic staging (pTNM; patients undergoing resection without \nprior treatment), and post  neoadjuvant pathologic staging (ypTNM; \npatients receiving preoperative therapy).25 The Eighth Edition also \nintroduced modifications regarding tumors located at the esophagogastric \njunction ( EGJ) and within the gastric cardia. Using this system, tumors \ninvolving the EGJ with an epicenter located > 2 cm into the proximal \nstomach are now staged as gastric carcinomas. Tumors involving the EGJ with an epicenter ≤2 cm into the proximal stomach will still be staged as \nesophageal carcinomas.\n Cancers located within the gastric cardia that do \nnot involve the EGJ are staged as gastric carcinomas.  \nThe Eighth Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual provides \nadditional resources for gastric cancer not available in the S eventh \nEdition, includi ng the addition of new  cTNM  and ypTNM  stage groupings, \nto fulfill unmet needs in staging patients under different circumstances. \nDue to the lack of an official clinical stage classification in the past,  treating \nphysicians have typically used the pathologi c stage to clinically stage \npatients . Furthermore, due to the lack of yp stage groupings, pathologic  \nstaging was also  applied to patients who had received preoperative \ntherapy. The use of pathology assessments to establish c TNM  and \nypTNM  stages  has never  been validated and may not be appropriate. \nTherefore, new c TNM  and ypTNM  stage groupings and prognostic \ninformation were added to the E ighth Edition to overcome these issues. \nNew clinical stage groupings and prognostic information are based on \ndatasets from the National Cancer Datab ase (NCDB), representing \npatients treated surgical ly or nonsurgical ly in the U nited States , and the \nShizuoka Cancer Center dataset, representing patients treated surgically in Japan, for a total of 4091 patients. These clinical stage groupings are \ndifferent from groupings used for pathologic or post  neoadjuvant staging. \nThe prognostic value of the newly proposed c TNM  stage criteria has been externally validated in a cohort of 4374 patients in Japan surgically  treated \nfor gastric cancer.\n26 Newly pr ovided  prognostic information for ypTNM  \nstaging is presented using only the four broad stage categories (stage I –\nIV) due to the limited number of patients (n = 700) available for analysis. \nThe addition of this new ypTNM stage grouping system  fulfills an unmet \nneed in the clinics  since many patients with gastric cancer are now treated \nwith preoperative therapy . Furthermore, t he stage groupings and \nprognostic information for pTNM  staging presented in the E ighth Edition \nare now based on data from >25,000 patients with gastric cancer from the \nInternational Gastric Cancer Association (IGCA) database who have had surgery with adequate lymph node removal. Patients treated with \npreoperative therapy were not included in the analysis. Pathologic stage \ngroupings were refined based on 5 -year survival data. Although most \n(84.8%) of the eligible cases from the IGCA database came from Japan and Korea, the predictive ability and accuracy of parameters used in the \nEighth Edition for pTNM  staging of gastric cancer hav e been validated for \nU.S. populations.\n27,28 The new pTNM  staging classification criteria have \nalso been externally validated in a cohort with a higher proportion of \nadvanced disease than the IGCA cohort (49% had stage III disease \ncompared to 26% in the IGCA cohort ; P < .001) .29 However, limitations of \nthis dataset still remain, including a lack of uniformity in initial clinical stage \nassessments, the lack of a uniform surgical approach, and the use of \npTNM  assessments for ypTNM  staging.25 \nBaseline clinical stage provides useful information for the development of an initial treatment strategy. T he availability of diagnostic modalities such \nas endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), CT, 18- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -\nPET/CT, and laparoscop y has greatly improved baseline clinical staging of \ngastric cancer .\n30-32 EUS is indicated for assessing the depth of tumor \ninvasion (T category ) as well as nodal involvement (N category ).33 \nHowever, the diagnostic accuracy of EUS is operator dependent, ranging from 57% to 88% for T staging and 30% to 90% for N staging.\n34 In a large PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-5 multi- institutional study that evaluated the use and accuracy of EUS in \npatients undergoing curative intent resection for gastric adenocarcinoma, \nthe overall accuracy of EUS was 46.2% for T category  and 66.7% for N \ncategory .35 Distant lymph node evaluation by EUS is also suboptimal \ngiven the limited depth and visualization of the transducer.36 EUS may be \nuseful for differentiating T3 and T4 tumors, but it should be used in \ncombination with other staging modalities.34,35 EUS is also useful to \nidentify superficial tumors for potential endoscopic approaches. Therefore, \nEUS is recommended if early -stage disease is suspected or if early versus \nlocally advanced disease needs to be determined.   \nCT scan is routinely used for preoperative staging and has an overall \naccuracy of 43%  to 82% for measuring depth of invasion. In contrast, \nFDG -PET has a lower accuracy rate because of low FDG  uptake  in diffuse \nand mucinous tumor types, which are common in gastric cancer.37,38 FDG -\nPET also has significantly lower sensitivity compared to CT in the \ndetection of local lymph node involvement (56% vs. 78%), although FDG -\nPET has improved specificity (92% vs. 62%).39 Thus, combined FDG -\nPET/CT imaging offers several potential advantages over FDG -PET or CT \nscans alone.40 FDG -PET/CT has a significantly higher accuracy rate in \npreoperative staging (68%) than FDG -PET (47%) or CT (53%) alone. \nAdditionally, reports have confirmed that FDG -PET alone is not an \nadequate diagnostic procedure in the detection and preoperative stagi ng \nof gastric cancer, but can be helpful when used in conjunction with CT.41,42 \nFDG -PET does not replace staging laparoscopy given its inability  to detect \nperitoneal disease.  \nPretreatment diagnostic laparoscopy can be used to detect occult \nmetastases. In a study conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer \nCenter, 657 patients with potentially resectable gastric adenocarcinoma \nunderwent laparoscopic staging over a period of 10 years.43 Metastatic \ndisease (M1) was detected in 31% of patients. However, limitations of \nlaparoscopic staging include two- dimensional evaluation and limited use in the identification of hepatic metastases and perigastric lymph nodes. \nCytology testing of peritoneal fluid can help improve laparoscopic staging \nthrough identification of occult carcinomatosis.30 Positive peritoneal \ncytology is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer \nand is an independent predictor for recurrence following curative \nresection.44-46 Clearing of cytology -positive disease by chemotherapy is \nassociated with a statistically significant improvement in disease- specific \nsurvival, but cures are rare and the role of surgery is uncertain.45 \nTherefore, positive peritoneal cytology even in the absence of visible peritoneal implants should be considered as M1 disease, and surgery as \ninitial treatment is not recommended. In patients being considered for \nsurgical resection without preoperative therapy, laparoscopy may be \nuseful for the detection of radiographically occult metastatic disease in \npatients with T3 and/or N+ tumors identified on preoperative imaging. The  \nPanel recommends performing diagnostic  laparoscopy to assess the \nperitoneal cavity  (with biopsies as needed) and  cytology of peritoneal \nwashings in patients who are medically fit with  potentially resectable stage \ncT1b or higher locoregional disease when considering perioperative \ntherapy and/or surgery.\n43 Laparoscop y with cytology can be considered for \npatients who are medically fit with surgically unresectable disease.  \nIn most countries , where screening programs for early detection of gastric \ncancer are not in use or practical because of low incidence, diagnosis is \noften made late in the disease course. Approximately 50% of patients \npresent with advanced disease at diagnosis and will lik ely have a poor \noutcome. Other measures of poor outcome include poor performance \nstatus, presence of metastases, and an alkaline phosphatase level ≥100 \nU/L.47 Additionally, nearly 80% of patients have involvement of the \nregional lymph nodes and the number of positive lymph nodes has a \nprofound influence on survival.48 In patients with localized resectable \ndisease, outcome depends on the surgical stage of the disease.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-6 Overview of Treatment Guidelines  \nThe comprehensive care  of patients with gastric cancer requires expertise \nin several disciplines, including surgical oncology, medical oncology, \nradiation oncology, gastroenterology, radiology, and pathology. In addition, \nthe presence of nutritional services, social workers, nurses, palliative care \nspecialists, and other supporting disciplines is also desirable.49 Hence, the \nPanel believes in an infrastructure that encourages multidisciplinary \ntreatment decision- making by members of all disciplines taking care of \npatients with gastric cancer. The recommendations made by the multidisciplinary team may be considered advisory to t he primary group of \ntreating physicians. See Principles of Multidisciplinary Team Approach for \nEsophagogastric Cancers  in the algorithm for more information.  \nWorkup  \nNewly diagnosed patients should receive a complete history and physical \nexamination, complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive chemistry \nprofile, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)  with biopsy of the \nprimary tumor. CT scan (with oral and IV contrast) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should also be performed. FDG -PET/CT evaluation from skull \nbase to mid -thigh is recommended  for locally advanced or metastatic \ndisease or  if clinically indicated . However, this may not be appropriate for \nT1 disease. EUS is recommended  if early -stage disease is suspected or if \nearly -stage versus locally advanced disease needs to be determined \n(preferred). Endoscopic resection ( ER) is essential for the accurate \nstaging of early -stage cancers (T1a or T1b) . Early-stage cancers can best \nbe diagnosed by ER. ER may also be therapeutic for early -stage disease. \nBiopsy of metastatic disease should be performed as clinically indicated. \nAssessment of Siewert tumor type should also be included as part of the \ninitial wo rkup in all patients w ith EGJ adenocarcinoma.\n50,51  \nUniversal testing for microsatellite instability (MSI) status by polymerase \nchain reaction ( PCR) /next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) or mismatch repair ( MMR ) status by immunohistochemistry  (IHC) is recommended in \nall newly diagnosed patients. HER2,  programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1), \nand claudin 18 isoform 2 (CLDN18.2)  testing are recommended at the \ntime of diagnosis if advanced/ metastatic disease is documented or \nsuspected. NGS should be considered via a validated assay. See \nPrinciples of P athologic Review and Biomarker Testing below for more \ninformation.  \nNutritional assessment and counseling as well as smoking cessation \nadvice, counseling, and pharmacotherapy (as indicated) are \nrecommended for all patients. The guidelines also recommend screening \nfor family history of gastric cancers. See Hereditary Cancer Predisposition \nSyndromes Associated with Gastric Cancer  above. Testing/screening for \nH. pylori and genetic testing should be considered as needed.  The Panel \nrecommends testing for H. pylori infection and to eradicate in all patients \nwith early gastric cancer,  if positive. If testing is positive, recommendations \nshould be discussed with family members as appropriate.  For close family \nmembers , H. pylori testing should be recommended,  and genetic testing \nshould be performed as needed.  \nInitial workup enables patients to be classified into three clinical stage \ngroups:  \n• Localized cancer (stages cTis or cT1a)  \n• Locoregional cancer (stages cT1b– cT4a; cM0 , Any N ) \n• Metastatic cancer (stage cT4b; cM1)  \nAdditional Evaluation \nAdditional evaluations are warranted to assess a patient’s medical \ncondition, their ability to tolerate major surgery, and the feasibility of \nresection. These evaluations may include pulmonary function studies, \ncardiac testing, and nutritional assessment.

Laparoscopy with cytology can be considered for patients who \nare medically fit with surgically unresectable disease.  It is not indicated if a \npalliative resection is planned.  \nAdditional evaluation enables patients with locoregional cancer to be \nfurther classified into the following groups:   \n• Medically fit with potentially resectable disease  \n• Medically fit with surgically unresectable disease  \n• Nonsurgical candidates (medically unable to tolerate major \nsurgery or medically fit but  decline surgery)  \nPrimary Treatment  \nPatients Who Are Medically Fit  \nER or surgery are the primary treatment options for patients  who are \nmedically able to tolerate major surgery  with localized (cTis or cT1a) \ntumors. Surgery is the treatment option for patients with potentially resectable cT1b tumors. For patients with cT2 or higher , any N tumors,  \nsurgery  or perioperative chemotherapy (category 1) are recommended  \noptions .\n52-54 For patients whose tumors are  cT2 or higher, any N and are \nMSI-high (MSI -H)/MMR  deficient (dMMR), preoperative or perioperative \nimmune checkpoint inhibitor  (ICI) therapy  may be considered.  See the \nCombined Modality Therapy  section for important considerations on ICIs \nin this setting. Chemoradiation or systemic therapy are the recommended \ntreatment options for patients who are medically fit whose locoregional \ncancer is found to be surgically unresectable after laparoscopic staging.\n55,56 See Combined Modality Therapy  below for more information.  Nonsurgical Candidates  \nER is recommended for nonsurgical candidates with cTis or cT1a tumors. Nonsurgical candidates with locoregional disease (cM0, any N) should \nreceive palliative management/best supportive care. All patients diagnosed with metastatic disease are considered nonsurgical candidates \nand should be treated with palliative management/best supportive care. \nSee the Principles of Palliative Care/Best Supportive Care  in the algorithm \nfor more information.   \nResponse Assessment and Additional Management  \nAdditional management options are based on the assessment of response \nto primary treatment. Therefore, chest/abdom en/pelvi s CT scan with \ncontrast (oral and IV) should be performed in patients who are medically fit \nafter the completion of perioperative chemotherapy and before surgical \nintervention. FDG -PET/CT scan can be performed as clinically indicated. \nPatients found to have resectable disease on imaging should proceed with surgery (preferred) or palliative management , while those found to have \nunresectable or metastatic disease after primary treatment should receive palliative management.  \nFor those patients with MSI -H/dMMR tumors who received preoperative or \nperioperative ICI, response assessment should include an FDG -PET/CT \n(5–8 weeks after therapy)  as clinically indicated and EGD  and biopsy. A \nchest/abdomen CT with oral and IV contrast (including pelvis CT, if \nclinically indicated) is recommended  but not required if FDG -PET/CT is \nperformed.  Patients with no evidence of disease should be discussed by a \nmultidisciplinary team and may undergo observation or surgery.  However,  \npatients with per sistent local disease have the option of surgery \n(preferred) or palliative management. Palliative management is \nrecommended for patients with new metastatic disease.  \nNonsurgical candidates should also be restaged using \nchest/abdom en/pelvi s CT scan with oral and IV contrast following primary PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

FDG -PET/CT scan can be performed as clinically indicated in \ncases of renal insufficiency or allergy to CT contrast. A CBC and \ncomprehensive chemistry profile are also recommended. Surgery is \npreferred, if appropriate, for patients found to have resectable, medically \noperable disease at restaging. Patients with unresectable, medically \ninoperable, or metastatic disease at restaging should receive palliative \nmanagement.  \nPostoperative Management  \nPostoperative management is based on pathologic tumor stage, nodal \nstatus, surgical margins, the extent of lymph node dissection, and previous \ntreatment.  \nPatients Who Have Not Received  Systemic Therapy \nThe benefit of postoperative therapy for patients who have not received preoperative therapy has been established in randomized trials.\n57-59 \nTherefore, postoperative chemoradiation is recommended for all patients following an R1 or R2 resection. Palliative management, as clinically \nindicated, is an alternative option for patients following an R2 resection. \nPostoperative chemoradiation is also recommended following an R0 \nresection for select patients with pT2, N0 tumors and high- risk features \n(eg, poorly differentiated or higher grade cancer, lymphovascular invasion \n[LVI], neural invasion, age <50 years, and not undergoing D2 lymph node \ndissecti on)\n60 and for patients with pT3– pT4, any N or any pT, N+ tumors \nwho received less than a D2 dissection (category 1). Patients with pT2, N0 \ntumors without high -risk features should undergo observation . Patients \nwith pT3– pT4, any N or any pT, N+ tumors who have undergone primary \nD2 lymph node dissection should receive postoperative chemotherapy \n(category 1).61,62 Given the relatively good prognosis combined with the \nlack of evidence from randomized clinical trials showing any survival \nbenefit f rom postoperative chemoradiation for patients with pTis or pT1, N0 tumors following R0 resection, the P anel recommends observation  for \nthis group of patients.   \nPatients Who Have Received Systemic Therapy  \nPatients who have received preoperative systemic therapy  should \nreceive postoperative systemic therapy  (perioperative therapy) following \nR0 resection (category 1). In the absence of distant metastases, chemoradiation is recommended for patients following R1 or R2 \nresection. Although this approach has not been evaluated in prospective \nstudies, the Panel feels this is a reasonable treatment option given the \nsignificantly worse prognosis associated with margin -positive resections. \nRe-resection, if feasible, can also be considered following R1 resection. \nPalliative management should be offered to all patients with new metastatic disease and may also be offered to patients with R2 \nresection, as clinically indicated.  \nFollow -up/Surveillance  \nPatients who are positive for H. pylori and who underwent curative \nendoscopic resection o r gastric subtotal resection should receive an H. \npylori  eradication regimen. Choice of regimen and duration should be \nbased on the latest American College of Gastroenterology or Maastricht \nConsensus Report H. pylori  guidelines.\n63 All patients should be followed \nsystematically. However, surveillance strategies after curative intent (R0) resection for gastric cancer remain controversial with sparse prospective \ndata to construct evidence- based recommendations that balance the \nbenefits  and risks, including costs, within this cohort. The surveillance \nstrategies provided in this guideline are based on the currently available \nretrospectively analyzed literature\n64-73 and expert consensus . While \nstudies have shown that most gastric cancer recurrences occur within the first 2 years after the completion of local therapy (70% –80%) and almost \nall recurrences occur by 5 years (~90%),\n64,66,71 a study of 1573 patients \nwho underwent curative intent therapy showed that 7.6% of recurrences PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

Thus, surveillance recommendations vary according to \nthe depth of invasion and treatment modality received by the patient.  \nIn general, surveillance for all patients should include a complete history and physical examination every 3 to 6 months for the first 2 years and then \nevery 6 to 12 months for years 3 to 5.  CBC and chemistry profile should \nbe obtained as clinically indicated. Patients with early -stage (Tis or T1a) \ntumors treated by ER should be surveilled with EGD every 6 months for the first year, and then annually for either 3 years (Tis) or 5 years (T1a).  \nEGD surveillance beyond 5 years for patients with T1a tumors should be based on symptoms and/or radiographic findings. Patients with stage I \ndisease (T1a or T1b) treated with surgery should receive EGD as clinically \nindicated. EGD should also be performed as clinically indicated in patients \nwho had partial or subtotal gastrectomy. Patients with Tis or stage I \ndisease may receive CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with \ncontrast as clinically indicated based on symptoms and concern for \nrecurrence. Patients with stage II or III disease should receive chest/abdom en/pelv is CT scan with oral and IV contrast every 6 months \nfor the first 2 years, then annually for up to 5 years. For stage I –III, CT \nscan is preferred, but alternative imaging such as FDG -PET/CT or MRI \ncan be considered as clinically indicated for patients who cannot undergo CT scan.  Surveillance for patients undergoing curative intent total \ngastrectomy should follow these recommendations, except for endoscopy. Endoscopy is an option as clinically indicated for routine surveillance and \nshould be used if patients are symptomatic. Patients with stage I –III \ndisease who underwent surgical resection should also have lifelong monitoring and management  for nutritional deficiencies, especially after \ntotal gastrectomy, as indicated.  See the Survivorship section for more \ndetails on nutritional deficiencies following gastrectomy.    \nPrinciples of Endoscopy  \nEndoscopy has become an important tool in the diagnosis, staging, \ntreatment, and palliation of patients with gastric cancer. Endoscopic \nmucosal resection ( EMR ) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) \nhave been used as alternatives to surgery for the treatment of patients with early -stage gastric cancer in Asia. However, the applicability of these \ntechniques in the United States is limited because of the low i ncidence of \nearly -stage disease.  Endoscopic procedures are best performed in centers \nwith experienced physicians.  \nDiagnosis  \nDiagnostic endoscopies are performed to determine the presence and \nlocation of gastric neoplasia and to biopsy suspicious lesions. The location \nof the tumor in the stomach (cardia, fundus, body, antrum, or pylorus) and \nrelative to the EGJ should be careful ly recorded to assist with treatment \nplanning and follow -up. Multiple biopsies (6– 8), using standard- size \nendoscopy forceps, should be performed to provide sufficient material for \nhistologic and molecular interpretation.\n74,75 Use of larger forceps may \nimprove this yield.  \nEMR or ESD of focal nodules ( ≤2 cm) can be safely performed in the \nsetting of early -stage disease to provide greater information on the degree \nof differentiation, the presence of LVI, and the depth of invasion, with the \nadded potential of being therapeutic.76,77  \nStaging  \nEUS provides accurate initial clinical staging of locoregional gastric cancer.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-10 depth of tumor invasion (T), presence of abnormal or enlarged lymph \nnodes likely to harbor cancer (N), signs of metastasis, such as lesions in \nsurrounding organs (M) , or the presence of ascites .78,79 Accurate clinical \nstaging is especially important in patients who are being considered for ER.\n80   \nHypoechoic (dark) expansion of the gastric wall layers identifies the \nlocation of the tumor, with gradual loss of the layered pattern of the normal \nstomach wall corresponding with greater depths of tumor infiltration and thus higher T- categories.  See Principles of Endoscopic Staging and \nTherapy  in the algorithm for detailed information on T- categories.  \nPerigastric lymph nodes are readily seen by EUS, and the identification of \nenlarged, hypoechoic, homogeneous, well -circumscribed, rounded \nstructures around t he stomach indicates the presence of malignant or \ninflammatory lymph nodes. The accuracy of this diagnosis is significantly \nincreased with the combination of features, but can also be confirmed with \nthe use of fine -needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy for cytology assessment.\n81 \nFNA of suspicious lymph nodes should be performed, without traversing \nan area of primary tumor or major blood vessels, if it will impact treatment \ndecisions. FNA should also be considered to rule out peritoneal spread of \ndisease.  \nTreatment  \nEMR represents a major advancement in minimally invasive approaches \nfor the comprehensive care of patients with early -stage gastric cancer.82 \nMost of the experience with EMR for early -stage disease has been gained \nby countries with a high incidence of gastric cancer and an active \nscreening program.83-87 In a study of 124 patients with early -stage mucosal \ngastric cancers, Uedo et al reported 5 - and 10- year survival rates of 84% \nand 64%, respectively, for patients receiving EMR.84 In another \nretrospective study of 215 patients with intramucosal gastric cancer, EMR \nresulted in significantly shorter hospital stays, but was comparable to surgery in terms of risk of death and recurrence.87 The proper selection of \npatients is essential to improve the clinical outcomes of EMR; endoscopic \ngross type (depressed lesion), the degree of differentiation, and the depth \nof invasion were identified as independent predictors of higher complete \nresection rates.85 \nESD has also been reported to be a safe and effective procedure for patients with early -stage gastric cancer when performed by experienced \nendoscopists.\n88-95 En-bloc excision of small gastric lesions by ESD has \nbeen shown to be more effective than EMR in several studies.96-103 In a \nmulticenter retrospective study of ER in patients with early -stage gastric \ncancer, the 3- year recurrence- free rate in the ESD group was significantly \nhigher than that in the EMR group (98% vs. 93%, respectively).96 The \ncomplete resection rates for ESD were significantly better for lesions >5 \ncm in diameter, whereas the rates were not different between EMR and \nESD for lesions < 5 cm in diameter regardless of location.97-99 ESD \nrequires a higher level of skill to perform and is also associated with higher rates of bleeding and perforation complications.\n101- 104 As these \ntechnologies continue to evolve as promising options for the diagnosis and \ntreatment of early -stage gastric cancers, the NCCN Panel recommends \nthat ER (EMR or ESD) be performed in high -volume medical centers with \nextensive experience in these tec hniques.  \nEarly -stage gastric cancer that is ≤ 2 cm in diameter  with favorable \nhistology that is  well to moderately differentiated, does not invade the \ndeep submucosa, does not exhibit LVI or lymph node metastases, and \nhas clear lateral and deep margins can be effectively treated with EMR or \nESD.77,103,105- 107 ESD is preferred. A GI pathologist should then evaluate \nthe specimen for features of curative resection, which include submucosal  \n(sm) invasion <500 µm without poorly or undifferentiated pathology and \nwith no evidence of LVI. The Panel recognizes many American and \nJapanese guidelines have expanded ESD indications , which are outlined \nin the algorithm.

Importantly, there is a very small risk of lymph node \ninvolvement , so these decisions should be made after multidisciplinary \ndiscussion and careful explanation to the patient.  Further treatment such  \nas gastrectomy for patients who are medically fit, systemic therapy  (ie, \npostoperative chemotherapy ) or surveillance should be considered, \ndepending on pathology.106,107 \nEMR or ESD of gastric cancers with unfavorable histology ( poorly \ndifferentiated or diffuse type with evidence of LVI, invasion into the deep \nsubmucosa, and positive lateral or deep margins ) should be considered \nincomplete and additional therapy (gastrectomy with lymph node \ndissection) should be considered for patients who are medically fit .106- 108 \nEndoscopic therapies also play a role in palliative care. Endoscopic tumor \nablation can be performed for the short -term control of gastric cancer -\nassociated bleeding. Endoscopic insertion of self -expanding metal stents \n(SEMS) is effective for the long- term relief of tumor obstruction at the EGJ \nor gastric outlet, al though surgical gastrojejunostomy may be more \nefficacious for those with longer -term predicted survival.109,110 Long- term \npalliation of anorexia, dysphagia, or malnutrition may be achieved with \nendoscopic - or radiographic -assisted placement of a feeding gastrostomy \ntube in carefully selected cases where the distal stomach is uninvolved by tumor, or the placement of  a feeding jejunostomy tube.\n111     \nSurveillance  \nEndoscopic surveillance following definitive treatment of gastric cancer \nrequires careful attention to detail for mucosal surface changes. Multiple \n(4–6) biopsies of any visualized abnormalities should be performed. \nAdditionally, strictures should also be biopsied to rule out neoplastic cause. EUS performed in conjunction with endoscopy exams has a high \nsensitivity for detecting recurrent disease.\n112 EUS-guided FNA should be \nperformed if suspicious lymph nodes or areas of wall thickening are observed. It should be noted that EUS performed after chemotherapy or \nradiation therapy (RT) has a reduced ability to accurately determine the \npost-treatment stage of disease.113 Similarly, biopsies performed after \nchemotherapy or RT may not accurately diagnose the presence of \nresidual disease but still provide useful information.114 \nPrinciples of Pathologic Review and Biomarker Testing  \nPathologic review and biomarker testing play important roles in the \ndiagnosis, classification , and molecular characterization of gastric \ncancer. Classification based on histologic subtype and molecular features helps improve early diagnosis and has implications for therapy. \nAn accumulation of genetic aberrations occurs during gastric \ncarcinogenesis, resulting in overexpression of growth factors and/or \nreceptors,  loss of certain tumor suppressor genes,  alterations in the cell \ncycle , and changes in the DNA repair and damage response .\n115,116 \nGenome instability , which includes increased chromosomal instability \nand MSI, is often associated with some of these changes and can  \ncontribute to tumorigenesis.116- 118 Additionally, MSI-H in gastric  tumors is \nfrequently associated with an increase in immune checkpoint ligand  \nexpression .118- 120 A genom ic stable subtype has also been identified by \nThe Cancer Genome Atlas  (TCGA ) data.115 Characterization of these \nalterations  and pathways has enabled the application of molecular \npathology to aid in the diagnosis, classification , and treatment of gastric \ncancer.  \nPrinciples of Pathologic Review  \nA specific diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma should be established for \nstaging and treatment purposes. Subclassification of gastric \nadenocarcinoma as intestinal or diffuse type may have implications for \ntherapy since intestinal type tumors are more likel y to be HER2  \noverexpression positive  (see below).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-12 pathology report (regardless of the specimen type) should include \nspecifics about tumor invasion and pathologic grade, which are required \nfor staging. Universal testing for MSI by PCR /NGS or MMR deficiency by \nIHC is recommended in all newly diagnosed patients.  The pathology report \nof EMR specimens should include an assessment of LVI, depth of tumor \ninvasion, tumor diameter , and the status of mucosal and deep margins. \nPathology reports of gastrectomy specimens should also document the location of the tumor m idpoint in relationship to the EGJ, whether the \ntumor crosses the EGJ, the lymph node status, and the number of lymph nodes recovered  (≥16). In patients who undergo gastrectomy following \ntreatment with chemoradiation for unresectable gastric cancer , and without \ngrossly obvious residual tumor, the tumor site should be thoroughly \nsampled to detect microscopic residual disease. The pathology report \nshould include all the above elements plus an assessment of treatment \neffect.  \nAssessment of Treatment Response  \nResponse of the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes to previous chemotherapy  or RT  should be reported. Pathologic response and \nhistologic tumor regression after neoadjuvant therapy have been shown to be predictors of survival in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. Lowy et \nal reported that response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was the only \nindependent predictor of OS in patients who underwent curative resection \nfor gastric cancer.\n121 Additionally, Mansour et al reported that the 3 -year \ndisease- specific survival rate was significantly higher for patients with \n>50% pathologic response to preoperative  chemotherapy compared to \nthose with < 50% pathologic response (69% and 44%, respectively).122 In \nanother study, Becker et al demonstrated that histopathologic grading of \ntumor regression was correlated with survival in patients treated with \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy.123 Conversely, Smyth et al reported that \nlymph node metastasis, not pathologic response to therapy, was the only independent predictor of survival in patients who received neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy as part of the MAGIC trial.124  \nTumor response scoring systems for gastric cancer have not been \nuniformly adopted. The Panel recommends using the modified scheme \ndeveloped by Ryan et al125,126 because it generally provides good \nreproducibility among pathologists, but other systems may also be used. \nThe following scheme is suggested: 0 (complete response [CR]; no viable \ncancer cells, including lymph nodes); 1 (near CR; single cells or rare small \ngroups of cancer cells); 2 (partial response; residual cancer cells with \nevident tumor regression, but more than single cells or rare small groups \nof cancer cells); and 3 (poor or no response; extensive residual cancer \nwith no evident tumor regression). B ecause of the impact of residual nodal \nmetastases on survival, it is recommended that lymph nodes be included in the regression score.

Some studies suggest that HER2 \npositivity is associated with poor prognosis131- 136 while others have shown \nthat it is not an independent prognostic factor of patient outcome, except in a very small subgroup of patients with intestinal histology.\n137- 139 While \nfurther studies are needed to assess the prognostic significance of HER2 \nstatus in gastric cancer, the addition of HER2 monoclonal antibodies to \nchemotherapy regimens is a promising treatment option for patients with \nHER2 overexpression- positive  disease.140  \nThe reported rates of HER2 positivity in patients with gastric cancer range \nfrom 12% to 23%.131,132,138,139,141,142 HER2 positivity also varies with the \nhistologic subtype (intestinal > diffuse) and tumor grade (moderately differentiated > poorly differentiated).\n132,136,138,139,141 HER2 positivity is \nreported in ≤20% of European and U.S. patients with metastatic gastric \ncancer with significantly higher rates seen in patients with intestinal \nhistology (33% vs. 8% for diffuse/mixed histology; P =  .001).138 In the U.S. \npopulation, the reported HER2 positivity rate in gastric cancer is 12% and \nis more often identified in the intestinal subtype rather than the diffuse \nsubtype (19% and 6%, respectively).139 The HER -EAGLE study, which \nexamined the HER2 positivity rate in a large multinational population of nearly 5000 patients with gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma, reported that 14.2% of samples were HER2 overexpression positive.\n143 HER2 positivity \nwas significantly higher in males versus females, in EGJ tumors versus \nstomach tumors, and in intestinal subtypes versus diffuse subtypes. In the \nToGA trial , which evaluated the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy \nin patients with HER2 overexpression -positive  advanced gastric or EGJ \ncancers, HER2 positivity rates were 32.2%, 21.4%, 31.8%, and 6.1%, respectively, in patients with EGJ adenocarcinoma, gastric \nadenocarcinoma, intestinal gastric adenocarcinoma, and diffuse gastric \nadenocarci noma.\n144,145 Therefore, subclassification of gastric \nadenocarcinomas as intestinal or diffuse type may have implications for therapy.  \nHER2 testing is recommended for all  patients with  gastric cancer  at the \ntime of diagnosis if advanced/ metastatic disease is documented or \nsuspected . In concordance with HER2 testing guidelines from the \nCollege of American Pathologists (CAP), the American Society for \nClinical Pathology (ASCP) , and the American Society for Clinical \nOncology (ASCO),\n146 the NCCN Guidelines® for Gastric Cancer  \nrecommend using IHC and, if needed, ISH techniques to assess HER2 \nstatus in gastric cancer.  As stated above, IHC/ISH /targeted PCR is \npreferred , followed by NGS later in the clinical course as appropriate. \nRepeat biomarker testing may be considered at clinical or radiologic progression of advanced or metastatic disease.  \nIHC evaluates the membranous immunostaining of tumor cells, including the intensity and extent of staining and the percentage of \nimmunoreactive tumor cells, with scores ranging from 0 (negative) to 3+ \n(positive). In 2008, Hofmann et al refined this 4 -tiered scoring system to \nassess HER2 status in gastric cancer by using a cut -off of ≥10% \nimmunoreactive tumor cells.\n145,147 In a subsequent validation study (n = \n447 prospective diagnostic gastric cancer specimens), this scoring \nsystem was found to be reproducible between different pathologists.148 \nThis modified HER2 scoring system is therefore recommended by the PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

Microsatellites are mutational hotspots, and loss of \nfunctional MMR facilitates elevated  mutation  events  at these sites.117 \nPrevalence of MSI-H/dMMR  in gastric cancer  can vary depending on \nfactors including disease stage, sex and age,  histologic type,  and tumor \nlocation. Specifically, MSI-H/dMMR status is associated with earl ier stage, \n≥68 years of age,  intestinal subtype, and if the tumor is in the distal \nstomach.115,118,149 -152 Analysis of gastric adenocarcinoma data from TCGA \nshowed an incidence of 22% for MSI -H tumors .115 Similarly, a  pan-cancer \nwhole -exome sequencing analysis of numerous  tumor -normal pairs  from \nboth TCGA and the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate \nEffective Treatments project  reported an incidence of 19% in MSI -H/dMMR in gastric tumors .153 Better prognosis has been reported with \nMSI-H/dMMR  gastric  tumors compared to microsatellite stable /MMR -\nproficient tumors ,149,150,154 including for those with MSI -H/dMMR who \nreceive immunotherapy.155,156 \nUniversal testing for MSI by PCR/NGS  or MMR by IHC should be \nperformed for all newly diagnosed patients with gastric cancer . PCR/NGS \nfor MSI and IHC for MMR proteins measure different biological  effects \ncaused by d MMR function.  MSI status  of the tumor  can be assessed by \nPCR to determine shifts in validated microsatellite  markers (eg,  \nmononucleotide repeats  BAT25 , BAT26 , MONO27 , NR21 , NR24 ).157 MMR \ndeficiency  is evaluated by IHC to assess nuclear expression of proteins \ninvolved in DNA MMR  (ie, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2).158 Testing is \nperformed on formalin- fixed, paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tissue and results \nare interpreted as MSI-H or dMMR in accordance with CAP DNA \nMismatch Repair Biomarker Reporting Guidelines .159 Testing should be \nperformed only in CLIA -approved laboratories. Patients with MSI -H or \ndMMR tumors should be referred to a genetics counselor for further \nassessment in the appropriate clinical context.  \nPD-L1 Testing  \nBinding of the programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1) receptor by  its \nligand PD-L1 is a critical immune checkpoint blockade that negatively \naffects T cell function and proliferation. Tumor cells can express PD -L1 \nand exploit  PD-1/L1 binding to facilitate immune evasion, tumor \ngrowth/survival, and moderate activity of different immune cell types and signaling.\n160- 162 This makes PD -1/L1 a valuable target , and P D-1/L1 \ninhibitors have emerged as beneficial therapeutic options for certain \npatients  (see Targeted Therapies ).  \nPD-L1 expression has been frequently observed in the intestinal \nsubtype,163- 165 though some studies have not observed a significant PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

This may be due to different factors such as PD -\nL1 testing variability or small sample size. Currently, some studies suggest \na significant favorable association with survival outcomes,156,164,165 while \nothers showed an unfavorable or no relationship between PD -L1 and \nsurvival .166,168 \nPD-L1 testing may be considered on locally advanced, recurrent, or \nmetastatic gastric cancers in patients who are candidates for treatment \nwith PD- 1 inhibitors. A companion diagnostic test should be used to \nidentify patients for treatment with PD -1 inhibitors. The companion \ndiagnostic test  is a qualitative IHC assay using anti -PD-L1 antibodies for \nthe detection of PD -L1 protein levels in FFPE tumor tissue. A minimum of \n100 tumor cells must be present in the PD -L1–stained slide for the \nspecimen to be adequately evaluated. Combined positive score (CPS) is \ndetermined by the number of PD -L1–stained cells (ie, tumor cells, \nlymphocytes, macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells evaluated, multiplied by 100. A specimen is considered to have PD -\nL1 expression if the CPS  is ≥1. PD -L1 testing should be performed only in \nCLIA -approved laboratories.  Tumor proportion score (TPS)  and tumor \narea positivity (TAP) score  are also considered and reported in some \ntrials , but they are not included in these Guidelines .    \nClaudin 18 Isoform 2  \nCLDN18.2 is a tight junction transmembrane protein that  is typically \nexpressed in normal gastric epithelia and is retained during malignant \ntransformation .169,170 CLDN18.2 -positive tumors represent 24% to 38% of \nadvanced gastric and EGJ adenocarcinomas.171- 174 However, due to \nvariations in detection methods, assays used , and differing definitions of \nCLDN18.2 positivity, the percentage of CLDN18.2 -positive tumors can vary across the literature.175 CLDN18.2 expression has been observed in \nintestinal -type gastric tumors, but is more commonly seen in the diffuse \nsubtype.171,172,174,176 CLDN18.2 positivity has been shown independent of \nother established molecular subtypes (eg, dMMR , HER2 status ) and PD-\nL1.172- 174 Association between CLDN18.2 and EBV status is unclear, as  \ncertain studies have reported a significant correlation between the \ntwo,171,172 while another  study reported no significance.173 \nChanges in tumor cell adhesion and polarity expose the normally \ninaccessible CLDN18.2 protein,  which makes it  a unique molecular \ntarget.177,178 Testing is recommended for untreated patients who have \nunresectable locally advanced, recurrent , or metastatic gastric \nadenocarcinoma and zolbetuximab is being considered.

A negative result should be interpreted with \ncaution, as this does not exclude the presence of a tumor.    \nEmerging Biomarker s  \nTumor Epstein- Barr Virus  \nTumor EBV status is emerging as a potential biomarker for personalized treatment strategies in gastric cancer. An estimated 8% to 10% of gastric \ncancers are associated with EBV infection, making EBV -positive gastric \ncancer the largest group of EBV -associated malignancies.\n181,182 EBV-\npositive tumors occur preferentially in the proximal stomach and are \nassociated with diffuse- type histology  and early  onset .11 Although the \nprognostic value of EBV status on the survival of patients with gastric \ncancer remains a subject of debate, several studies suggest that patients \nwith EBV -positive gastric cancer have better OS rates compared to other \ngenotypes.183- 187 Additional studies have shown that expression of PD -L1 \nis elevated in EBV -positive gastric cancers and is associated with \ndecreased OS rates.188- 190 Furthermore, Derks et al reported that an \ninterferon- γ–driven gene signature was enriched in EBV -positive gastric \ncancers, suggesting increased sensitivity to PD -1/PD -L1 \nimmunotherapies.189 Therefore, PD -1/PD -L1 immunotherapies may be a \nviable option to treat patients with EBV- positive gastric cancer; however, \nmore data are needed to substantiate this claim. Due to the lack of \nprospective trials and limited understanding of the exact association \nbetween EBV and gastric cancer, testing for EBV status is not currently \nrecommended for routine clinical care. However, EBV testing should be \nperformed if the morphology of the tumor contains prominent lymphoid \nstroma.  Principles of Surgery  \nSurgery is the primary treatment option for patients with localized gastric \ncancer. Complete resection with negative margins is widely considered as \na standard goal, whereas the type of resection (subtotal vs. total \ngastrectomy) and the extent of lymph node dissection remain subjects of \ncontroversy.  \nClinical staging using chest/abdom en/pelvi s CT scan, with or without EUS \n(if no metastatic disease is seen on CT), should be performed before \nsurgery to assess the extent of the disease and degree of nodal \ninvolvement. The primary goal of surgery is to accomplish a complete \nresection with negative margins (R0 resection); however, only 50% of \npatients will have an R0 resection of their primary tumor.191,192 An R1 \nresection indicates microscopic residual disease and an R2 resection \nindicates macroscopic residual disease in the absence of distant \nmetastasis.193 Adequate gastric resection to achieve negative microscopic \nmargins  along with lymphadenectomy  is preferred for resectable T1b to T3 \ntumors, while T4b  tumors require en- bloc resection of involved \nstructures.194 Patients with Tis or T1a tumors may be considered for EMR \nor ESD if they meet appropriate criteria ( in experienced centers ).  \nSubtotal gastrectomy has a similar surgical outcome compared to total \ngastrectomy  for distal gastric cancers , although with significantly fewer \ncomplications.195 Proximal gastrectomy and total gastrectomy are both \nindicated for proximal gastric cancers and are typically associated with \npostoperative nutritional impairment. Placement of a feeding tube should \nbe considered for select patients  undergoing total gastrectomy , especially \nthose receiving postoperative chemoradiation.  \nRoutine splenectomy is not indicated unless the spleen is involved or \nextensive hilar adenopathy is noted. In a randomized clinical study, \npostoperative mortality and morbidity rates were significantly higher in \npatients who underwent total gastrectomy combined with splenectomy PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-17 compared to those who underwent total gastrectomy alone.196 A recently \npublished meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials also concluded \nthat splenectomy should not be recommended for proximal gastric cancer \nsince it increases operative morbidity without improving OS when \ncompared to spleen- preserving procedures.197 The results of these studies \ndo not support the use of prophylactic splenectomy or removal of \nmacroscopically negative lymph nodes near the spleen in patients \nundergoing total gastrectomy for proximal gastric cancer.  \nIn patients with incurable disease, gastric resections should be reserved for the palliation of symptoms (eg,  obstruction or uncontrollable bleeding)  \nwhen nonsurgical options are not feasible such as endoscopic or  \ninterventional radiology procedures (ie, endoscopic stenting) . Also, it does  \nnot need to include lymph node dissection.\n49,198 In patients fit for surgery \nand who have a reasonable prognosis, gastrojejunostomy (open or \nlaparoscopic) or endoluminal stenting are options. Except for rare cases \nthat may have slow growth, endoluminal stenting is preferred in patients \nwith gastric outle t obstruction/disease and very minimal metastatic disease \nin the liver or other area not affecting the GI tract. If longer -term palliation \nis needed, surgical bypass may be considered.199,200 Venting gastros tomy \nand/or a feeding tube may also be considered .  \nGastric adenocarcinoma  is considered unresectable if there is evidence of \nperitoneal involvement (including positive peritoneal cytology), distant metastases, or locally advanced disease (N3 lymph node involvement or \ninvasion/encasement of major vascular structures, excluding the splenic \nvessels). Limited gastric resection, even with positive margins, is \nacceptable for patients with unresectable tumors for the palliation of \nsymptomatic bleeding.  \nLymph Node Dissection   \nGastric resection should include the removal of regional lymph nodes \n(lymphadenectomy). Lymph node dissection may be classified as D0, D1, or D2 depending on the extent of lymph node removal at the time of \ngastrectomy. D0 dissection refers to an incomplete resection of lymph \nnodes along the lesser and greater curvature of the stomach. D1 \ndissection involves the removal of the greater and less er omenta (which \nincludes the right and left cardiac lymph nodes along lesser and greater \ncurvature and the suprapyloric lymph nodes along the right gastric artery \nand infra -pyloric area). D2 involves D1 dissection plus the removal of all \nthe lymph nodes along the left gastric artery, common hepatic artery, celiac artery, and splenic artery. The technical aspects of perf orming a D2 \nlymph node dissection require a significant degree of training and expertise. Therefore, D2 dissections should be performed in centers \nexperienced with this technique.  \nGastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection is the standard treatment for curable gastric cancer in East Asia. In Western countries, extended \ndissection of distant lymph nodes contributes to accurate staging of the \ndisease; however, its contribution to the prolongation of survival is \nunclear.\n128,201,202 Results from two large randomized trials performed in \nWestern countries  did not  demonstrate a significant survival benefit for D2 \nover D1 lymph node dissection.203,204 In the Dutch Gastric Cancer Group \nTrial, 711 patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent \nwere randomized to undergo either a D1 or D2 lymph node dissection.203 \nThe postoperative morbidity (25% vs. 43% ; P < .001) and mortality (4% \nvs. 10% ; P = .004) rates were higher for patients who underwent D2 lymph \nnode dissection, with no difference in OS (30% vs. 35 %; P = .53) between \nthe two groups. After a median follow -up of 15 years, D2 lymph node \ndissection was associated with lower local recurrence (12% vs. 22%), \nregional recurrence (13% vs. 19%), and gastric cancer -related deaths \n(37% vs. 48%) than D1 lymph node dis section, but OS rates were similar \nbetween the two gr oups (21% and 29%, respectively ; P = .34).205 The \nBritish Cooperative trial conducted by the Medical Research Council also \ndid not  demonstrate a survival benefit for D2 over D1 lymph node PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

However, there was a trend toward improved OS among \npatients who underwent D1 or D2 lymph node dissection at moderate-  to \nhigh- volume cancer centers. In a randomized phase II trial of D1 versus \nD2 lymph node dissection conducted by the Italian Gastric Cancer Study \nGroup involving 267 patients (133 patients allocated to D1 lymph node \ndissection and 134 patients allocated to D2 lymph node dissection), the \n30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were not significantly \ndifferent between the two groups.207,208 After a median follow -up of 8.8 \nyears, the 5- year OS rates were 66.5% and 64.2% after D1 and D2 lymph \nnode dissections, respectively, although this difference was not significant \n(P = .695).208  \nInvestigators have long argued that D2 lymph node dissection may be beneficial in select patients if the complication rate is decreased. Although \npancreatectomy and splenectomy have been widely performed with D2 \nlymph node dissections in Japan, both of these procedures have been \nshown to increase postoperative mortality and morbidity.\n203,204,210,211 In a \nprospective, randomized, phase II study conducted by the Italian Gastric \nCancer Study Group, pancreas -preserving D2 lymph node dissection was associated with a survival benefit and lower complication rate in patients \nwith advanced gastric cancer.210,211 Pancreatectomy was performed only \nwhen T4 tumor involvement was suspected. Postoperative complications were higher after D2 gastrectomy (16.3% vs. 10.5% after D1), but the \ndifference was not significant ( P = .29). Postoperative mortality rates were \n0% and 1.3%, respectively, in the D1 and D2 groups. The overall 5 -year \nmorbidity rate was 20.9% and the postoperative in- hospital mortality rate \nwas 3.1% for D2 lymph node dissection without pancreatectomy.\n211 These \nrates are comparable with the rates for D1 lymph node dissections in the \nDutch and United Kingdom trials.203,204 Meta- analyses have confirmed that \namong patients who underwent D2 lymph node dissections, there was a \ntrend toward improved survival and lower gastric cancer -related mortality \nin patients who did not undergo resection of the spleen or pancreas.212- 214  \nFor patients with localized resectable gastric cancer,  the NCCN Guidelines \nfor Gastric Cancer recommend gastrectomy with a D1 or a modified D2 \nlymph node dissection, with a goal of examining ≥16 lymph \nnodes.201,205,210,211 The guidelines emphasize that D2 lymph node \ndissections should be performed by experienced surgeons in high- volume \ncenters. Routine or prophylactic pancreatectomy is not recommended with D2 lymph node dissection,\n196,215 and splenectomy is acceptable only when \nthe spleen is involved  or extensive hilar adenopathy is noted.   \nLaparoscopic Resection  \nLaparoscopic resection is an emerging surgical approach that offers \nseveral potential advantages (less blood loss, reduced postoperative pain, \naccelerated recovery, early return to normal bowel function, and reduced \nhospital stay) when compared to open sur gical procedures for gastric \ncancer.216- 218 In a propensity score- matched analysis of 692 patients who \nunderwent total gastrectomy for gastric cancer, patients who received \nlaparoscopic resection had less blood loss, shorter mean operation time, \nand a higher number of retrieved lymph nodes compared to patients who PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

In the \nphase III CLASS- 01 tri al, 1056 Chinese patients with locally advanced \ngastric cancer (cT2 to cT4a) were randomized to receive laparoscopic or \nopen distal gastrectomy, both with D2 lymph node dissection.\n221 After 3 \nyears, the DFS rate was 76.5% in the laparoscopic group and 77.8% in \nthe open group (hazard ratio [HR] for recurrence = 1.069). The 3- year OS \nrates and cumulative incidence of recurrence were also similar between \nthe two groups (83.1% and 18.8%, respectively, in the laparoscopic group \nand 85.2% and 16.5% in the open group) , suggesting that the long -term \noncologic outcomes of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy were noninferior to \nthose of the conventional open surgery for patients with advanced gastric \ncancer. The randomized CLASS -02 trial compared the safety of \nlaparoscopic and open total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy in 277 patients with early -stage gastric cancer.\n222 The rates of overall morbidity \nand mortality, intraoperative complications, and overall postoperative complications were not significantly different between the groups . \nAlthough one patient in the laparoscopic  group died from intra -abdominal \nbleeding secondary to splenic artery hemorrhage, there was no significant \ndifference in mortality between the laparoscopic  and open groups.  These  \nresults showed that the safety of laparoscopic total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy by experienced surgeons for early -stage gastric cancer \nwas comparable to that of an open procedure . The randomized phase III KLASS -01 trial  reported the long- term outcomes \nof 1416 Korean patients with stage I gastric cancer randomized to receive \nlaparoscopic or open gastrectomy.\n223 The 5- year OS rates were 94.2% in \nthe laparoscopic group and 93.3% in the open surgery group ( P = .64) , \nand 5- year cancer -specific survival rates were 97.1% and 97.2%, \nrespectively ( P = .91).  Intention- to-treat analysis confirmed the \nnoninferiority of laparoscopic gastrectomy compared with the open \napproach. Although these results suggest that laparoscopic resection may \nbe a feasible surgical strategy, the role of this approach in the treatment of \ngastric cancer in Western countries requires further investigation.  The \nrandomized phase III KLASS -02 trial reported the long- term outcomes of \nlaparoscopic or open subtotal distal gastrectomy with D2 \nlymphadenectomy in 974 Korean patients with locally advanced gastric \ncancer .224 Compared to the open surgery group, the laparoscopy group \nsuffered fewer early complications (15.7% vs . 23.4%;  P = .0027) and late \ncomplications (4.7% vs . 9.5%;  P = .0038). The 3 -year relapse- free survival \nrate was 80.3% for the laparoscopy group and 81.3% for the open group (P = .726). Therefore, the outcomes of laparoscopic distal gastrectomy \nwith D2 lymphadenectomy were comparable to those of open surgery in \npatients with locally advanced gastric cancer.  \nBased on these and other data suggesting equivalent oncologic outcomes \nin the East and West, the P anel suggests that minimally invasive \napproaches may be considered for selected cases provided that the surgeon has experience in performing laparoscopic or robotic foregut \nprocedures and has experience in lymphadenectomy.\n225 Minimally \ninvasive approaches are generally not recommended for T4b or N2 bulky \ngastric cancer.  \nPrinciples of Radiation Therapy  \nRT has been assessed in randomized trials in both the preoperative and \npostoperative settings in patients with resectable gastric cancer.

Moertel et al assessed fluorouracil plus RT compared with RT alone in the treatment of \nlocally advanced unresectable gastric cancer.\n55 Patients receiving \ncombined modality treatment had significantly better median OS  (13 vs. 6 \nmonths) and 5- year OS (12% vs. 0%) rates compared to those receiving \nRT alone. In another study by the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group, 90 patients with locally advanced gastric cancer were randomized to receive \neither combination chemotherapy with fluorouracil and lomustine or split -\ncourse RT with concurrent bolus fluorouracil followed by maintenance with fluorouracil and lomustine.\n228 At 3 years, the survival curve reached a \nplateau in the combined modality arm while tumor -related deaths \ncontinued to occur in the chemotherapy -alone arm, suggesting that a \nsmall fraction of patients can be cured with combined modality therapy.  \nRandomized clinical trials have also been conducted to compare surgery \nalone to surgery plus RT in patients with resectable gastric cancer. In a \ntrial conducted by the British Stomach Cancer Group, 432 patients were \nrandomized to undergo surgery alone or surgery followed by either RT or \nchemotherapy.229 At the 5 -year follow -up, no survival benefit was seen for \npatients receiving postoperative RT or chemotherapy compared with those who underwent surgery alone. However, there was a significant reduction \nin locoregional recurrence with the addition of RT to surgery (27% for \nsurgery vs. 10% for surgery plus RT and 19% for surgery plus chemotherapy).  The results from a systematic review and meta- analysis \nalso showed a significant 5- year survival benefit with the addition of RT to \nsurgery in patients with resectable gastric cancer.\n230  Intensity -modulated RT (IMRT) has the potential to reduce radiation -\nrelated toxicity by delivering large doses of RT to target tissues while \nsparing adjacent organs. Retrospective studies have shown that IMRT can \nlead to improved organ sparing and lower toxicity, compared to 3D \nconformal techniques.231- 234 \nGeneral Guidelines  \nRT treatment recommendations  should be made after joint consultation \nand/or discussion by a multidisciplinary team , which should include \nmedical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgical oncologists, \nradiologists, gastroenterologists, and pathologists. Imaging studies and \nendoscopy reports should be reviewed by this multidisciplinary team to \nensure an informed determination of treatment volume and field borders \nprior to simulation. All available information from pretreatment diagnostic \nstudies should be used to determine the target volume. Image guidance \nmay be used appropriately to enhance clinical targeting. In general, Siewert Type I and II tumors should be managed with RT guidelines \napplicable to esophageal and EGJ cancers (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nEsophageal and EGJ Cancers  [available at www.nccn.org\n]). Depending \non the clinical situation, Siewert Type III tumors may be appropriately managed with RT guidelines applicable to either esophageal and EGJ \ncancers or gastric cancer. These recommendations may be modified \ndepending on the location of the bulk of  the tumor.  \nA dose range of 45 to 50.4 Gy delivered in fractions of 1.8 Gy per day is recommended by the Panel. Higher doses may be used as a boost for \npositive surgical margins in select patients.  \nSimulation and Treatment Planning    \nCT simulation and conformal treatment planning should be used. IV and/or \noral contrast may be used for CT simulation to aid in target localization \nwhen clinically appropriate.

The use \nof an immobilization device is strongly recommended for reproducibility. \nMotion management techniques, such as 4D -CT planning, may be \nappropriately utilized in select circumstances where organ motion with respiration may be significant.  \nIMRT may be used in clinical settings where dose reduction to organs at risk is required.\n231- 234 Target volumes need to be carefully defined and \nencompassed when designing IMRT plans. Uncertainties from variations in stomach filling and respiratory motion should be considered . In \ndesigning IMRT for organs at risk, attention should be given to the volume receiving low to moderate doses, as well as the volume receiving high \ndoses.  \nTarget Volume  \nIn the postoperative setting, clip placement should be performed in \naddition to pretreatment diagnostic studies  to identify the tumor/gastric \nbed, the anastomosis or stumps, and pertinent nodal groups.\n57,226 \nTreatment of the remaining stomach should depend on a balance of the \nnormal tissue morbidity and the risk of local recurrence in the residual \nstomach.   \nThe relative risk of nodal metastases at a specific location is dependent on \nthe site of the primary tumor and other factors including the depth of \ninvasion into the gastric wall. Nodal areas at risk include the perigastric, \nceliac, left gastric artery, splenic artery, splenic hilar, hepatic artery, porta \nhepatic, suprapyloric, subpyloric, and pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes. \nCoverage of nodal areas may be modified based on clinical circumstances \nand the risks of toxicity. See Principles of Radiation Therapy  - Target \nVolume in the algorithm for more information.  Normal Tissue Tolerance and Dose Limits  \nTreatment planning is essential to reduce unnecessary RT doses to \norgans at risk (liver, kidneys, small bowel, spinal cord, heart, and lungs) \nand to limit the volume of organs at risk receiving high RT doses . \nParticular e ffort should be made to keep RT doses to the left ventricle of \nthe heart to a minimum. Additionally, lung dose- volume histogram (DVH) \nparameters can be used as predictors of pulmonary complications in \npatients treated with concurrent chemoradiation. Although every effort \nshould be made to m inimize RT doses to organs at risk, it is recognized \nthat these dose guidelines may be appropriately exceeded based on clinical circumstances.  \nSupportive Care  \nCareful monitoring and management of acute toxicities with aggressive \nsupportive care is essential to avoid treatment interruptions or dose \nreductions. During an RT treatment course, patients’ vital signs, weight, \nand blood counts should be measured at least once per week. \nProphylactic antiemetics should be given when appropriate. Additionally, \nantacid and antidiarrheal medications may be prescribed when needed. If \nthe estimated caloric intake is inadequate (<1500 kcal/day ), oral and/or \nenteral nutrition should be considered.

Preoperative  or \nperioperative ICIs can be considered for certain patients with an MSI-\nH/dMMR gastric tumor.  Importantly, for MSI- H/dMMR tumors, a \nmultidisciplinary team should be consulted for perioperative \nimmunotherapy. The role of surgery following  biopsy proven and \nconfirmed radiologic/metabolic CR after preoperative immunotherapy is \nunclear.  \nPerioperative Chemotherapy   \nThe survival benefit of perioperative chemotherapy in gastric cancer was \nfirst demonstrated in the landmark phase III MAGIC trial.239 This study, \nwhich compared perioperative chemotherapy with epirubicin, cisplatin, and \nfluorouracil (ECF) to surgery alone, established that perioperative \nchemotherapy improves progression- free survival ( PFS)  and OS in \npatients with non- metastatic stage II and higher gastric or  EGJ \nadenocar cinoma. In the randomized controlled phase II/III FLOT4 trial, Al -\nBatran et al compared perioperative chemotherapy with fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (FLOT) to the standard ECF regimen \nin patients w ith resectable non- metastatic gastric or  EGJ adenocarcinoma \n(≥cT2 and/or N+) .\n54,241 In the phas e II part of the study, 265 patients were \nrandomized to rec eive either three preoperative and postoperative  cycles \nof ECF (n = 137) or four preoperative and postoperative cycles of  FLOT (n \n= 128). Results showed that  FLOT was associated with significantly higher \nproportions of  patients  achieving pathologic CR than was ECF (16%; 95% \nCI, 10 –23 vs. 6%;  95% CI, 3– 11; P = .02).241 Additionally, FLOT was \nassociated with a reduction in the percentage of patients experiencing at \nleast one grade  3–4 adverse event  (AE), including neutropenia, \nleucopenia, nausea, infection, fatigue, and vomiting (40% of patients in the ECF group vs. 25% of patients  in the FLOT group). In the phase III part of the trial, 716 patients were randomized to receive FLOT (n = 356) or ECF \n(n = 360).\n54 Results showed that median OS was increased in the FLOT \ngroup compared with the ECF group (50 vs.  35 months; HR , 0.77; 95% CI, \n0.63– 0.94). The percentage of patients with serious chemotherapy -related \nAEs was the same  in the two groups (27% in the ECF group vs. 27% in \nthe FLOT group). Therefore, ECF should no longer be recommended in \nthis setting . However, because of considerable toxicity associated with the \nFLOT regimen, the Panel recommends its use in select patients with good \nperformance status  (category  1). The perioperative regimen for most \npatients who have  good to moderate  performance status is fluorouracil \nand oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX ). \nIn the FNCLCC ACCORD 07 trial (n = 224 patients; 25% had gastric \nadenocarcinoma), Ychou et al reported that perioperative chemotherapy \nwith fluorouracil and cisplatin significantly increased the curative resection \nrate, DFS, and OS in patients with resectable cancer.52 At a median \nfollow- up of 5.7 years, the 5- year OS rate was 38% for patients in the \nperioperative chemotherapy group and 24% for patients in the surgery \nalone group ( P = .02). The corresponding 5 -year DFS rates were 34% and \n19%, respectively. Although this trial was prematurely terminated due to low accrual, the P anel feels that  perioperative  fluorouracil and cisplatin is a \nviable treatment option for patients with locally advanced resectable gastric cancer  (category 1) .   \nThe phase III randomized CRITICS trial, which compared perioperative chemotherapy with preoperative chemotherapy followed by postoperative \nchemoradiation in 788 patients with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma, \nfound that postoperative chemoradiation did not improve OS compared \nwith postoperative chemotherapy.\n238 Patients were randomized to receive \neither three  preoperative and three  postoperative cycles of modified ECF \nregimens (chemotherapy group; n = 393) or capecitabine and cisplatin \nwith concurrent RT (chemoradiation group; n = 395).

After a \nmedian follow -up of 6.7 years, the 5- year OS was 58% in the \nchemotherapy group versus 46% in the chemoradiation group (HR , 1.62; \nP = .0004).242 Therefore, adding RT to postoperative chemotherapy \nconfers no survival benefit following adequate preoperative chemotherapy \nand surgery. Since there was poor postoperative adherence in both \ntreatment groups, optimization of preoperative treatment strategies is integral . An ongoing phase II trial (CRITICS II)  is compar ing three  \npreoperative strategies (chemotherapy, concurrent chemoradiation, and sequential chemotherapy and chemoradiation) in participants with \nresectable gastric cancer (Clinical Trial ID:  NCT02931890\n).243  \nPreoperative  or Perioperative Immunotherapy \nFor certain patients with MSI -H/dMMR gastric tumors, immunotherapy in \nthe neoadjuvant or perioperative setting may be an option. The GERCOR \nNEONIPIGA phase II trial investigated the use of  neoadjuvant  nivolumab  \n(monoclonal PD -1 antibody ) plus ipilimumab (monoclonal CTLA- 4 \nantibody) followed by adjuvant nivolumab in 32 patients with  locally \nadvanced gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma and confirmed  MSI-H/dMMR.244 \nFollowing neoadjuvant therapy, 29 patients underwent R0 resection and a little more than half (~59%) had a p athologic CR. Of the 31 patients \nevaluated for survival, 97% had a survival benefit.\n244 The Panel \nrecommends nivolumab plus ipilimumab followed by nivolumab as a \ncategory 2A option useful in certain circumstances for patients with MSI -\nH/dMMR  gastric  tumors  in the neoadjuvant or perioperative settings .  \nIn another phase II trial, 35 patients with locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR \nsolid tumors  (most with stage III colorectal cancer)  received neoadjuvant \npembrolizumab (monoclonal PD -1 antibody).245 Among 33 patients \nassessed, the overall response rate (ORR) was 82%  and CR was \nobserved in 30% of patients. Out of 17 patients whose tumors were surgically resected, 65% had a p athologic CR.245 Individual case reports  \nhave also shown certain patients with MSI -H/dMMR gastric cancer may \nbenefit from neoadjuvant pembrolizumab.246 Based on these data, t he \nPanel recommends pembrolizumab as a category 2A  option useful in \ncertain circumstances for patients with MSI -H/dMMR gastric tumors in the \nneoadjuvant or perioperative settings.  \nThe combination of tremelimumab, a CTLA -4 inhibitor, and durvalumab, a  \nPD-L1 inhibitor , was previously approved by the FDA for unresectable \nhepatocellular carcinoma and for certain patients with metastatic non -\nsmall cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) . These ICIs have also been investigated in \ncombination in gastric cancer. In a randomized phase I b/II trial, previously \ntreated patients with gastric or EGJ cancer  received either tremelimumab \nmonotherapy , durvalumab monotherapy,  or the combination.247 There was \nno significant difference in ORR and PFS  between  the combination and \neither durvalumab or tremelimumab monotherapy, and median OS between the same treatment arms was 9.2, 3.4, and 7.7 months, \nrespectively.  The most common AEs regardless of treatment were fatigue, \ndecreased appetite, diarrhea, and pruritis.\n247 In the ongoing phase II \nINFINITY trial, patients with resectable MSI -H/dMMR gastric or EGJ \nadenocarcinoma received preoperative or definitive \ntremelimumab/durvalumab. Primary endpoint analysis showed a \npathologic CR rate of 60% in the preoperative arm, and those who had \npathologic CR were negative for  ctDNA prior to surgery.248 The Panel \nrecommends tremelimumab and durvalumab as preoperative therapy only \n(category 2A, useful in certain circumstances).                          \nPostoperative Chemoradiation Therapy  \nThe landmark INT- 0116 trial  investigated the effectiveness of surgery \nfollowed by postoperative chemotherapy plus chemoradiation on the survival of patients with resectable gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma.\n57,58 In \nthis trial, 556 patients (stage IB to IV, M0) who had not received PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

The postoperative \nchemotherapy plus chemoradiation group also had better 3- year OS (50% \nvs. 41%) and RFS rates (48% vs. 31%) than the surgery -only group. \nThere was also a significant decrease in local failure as the first site of failure in the c hemoradiation group (19% vs. 29%). After a median follow -\nup of > 10 years, survival remained improved in patients treated with \npostoperative chemoradiation.\n58  \nThe results of the INT- 0116 trial established the efficacy of postoperative \nchemoradiation in patients with completely resected gastric or EGJ \nadenocarcinoma  who have not received preoperative therapy. However, \nthe dosing and schedule of chemotherapy agents used in this trial were \nassociated with high rates of grade 3– 4 hematologic and GI toxicities \n(54% and 33%, respectively). Among the 281 patients assigned to the \nchemoradiation group, 17% discontinued treatment and three patients \ndied as a result of chem oradiation- related toxicities, including pulmonary \nfibrosis, cardiac events, and myelosuppression. Therefore, the doses and \nschedule of chemotherapy agents used in the INT- 0116 trial are not \nrecommended by the Panel due to concerns regarding toxicity. See \nPrinciples of Systemic Therapy —Regimens and Dosing Schedules  in the \nalgorithm for recommended modifications to this regimen.  \nThe degree of lymph node dissection during gastrectomy may influence \nthe efficacy of postoperative chemoradiation. A retrospective analysis that \ncompared the outcomes of patients treated with surgery alone to patients \ntreated with postoperative fluoropyrim idine -based chemoradiation reported that postoperative chemoradiation was associated with significantly lower \nrecurrence rates after D1 lymph node dissection. However, there was no \nsignificant difference in recurrence rates between the two groups following \nD2 lymph node dissection.240 The results of the phase III ARTIST trial \nconfirmed that postoperative chemoradiation did not significantly reduce \nrecurrence rates after D2 lymph node dissection in patients with curatively \nresected gastric cancer compared to postoperative chemotherapy.59,249 \nInterestingly, postoperative chemoradiation was associated with a \nsignificant prolongation of 3 -year DFS compared to postoperative \nchemotherapy in a subgroup (ad -hoc) of patients with positive lymph \nnodes (78% vs. 72%; P =  .0365).249 However, the phase III ARTIST II trial \ndemonstrated no survival benefit for the addition of radiation to postoperative chemotherapy in 546 patients with node- positive, D2 -\nresected gastric cancer (3- year DFS of 74.3% vs. 72.8% for postoperative \nchemotherapy and postoperative chemoradiation, respectively; HR , .971; \nP = .879).\n250 Therefore, postoperative chemoradiation is recommended for \npatients who received less than a D2 lymph node dissection while patients \nwho received a D2 lymph node dissection should be treated with \npostoperative chemotherapy.  \nPostoperative Chemotherapy  \nThe phase III CLASSIC trial (conducted in South Korea, China, and \nTaiwan) evaluated postoperative chemotherapy with capecitabine and \noxaliplatin after curative gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection in \n1035 patients with stage II or IIIB gastric cancer.61,62 In this study, patients \nwere randomized to receive either surgery alone (n = 515) or surgery followed by postoperative chemotherapy (n = 520). After a median follow -\nup of 34.2 months, postoperative chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin significantly improved 3- year DFS (74%) compared to surgery \nalone (59%) for all disease stages ( P < .0001).\n61 After a median follow -up \nof 62.4 months, the estimated 5- year DFS rate was 68% for the \npostoperative chemotherapy group compared to 53% for the surgery alone PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

The Panel also endorses the use of FOLFOX in this setting. However, \nit should be noted that the benefit of postoperative chemotherapy following \na D1 or D0 lymph node dissection has not been documented in \nrandomized clinical trials. Thus, postoperative chemoradiation remains the \ntreatment of choice for this patient population.57,58,240  \nPeritoneal Carcinoma as Only Disease \nFor many patients with locally advanced  or metastatic  gastric cancer,  \nthere is a  high risk of peritonea l disease, which confers a poor prognosis. \nThe blood- peritoneal barrier presents challenges in effectively treating \nthe disease.251,252 For selected patients with only peritoneal metastatic \ndisease, see Peritoneal Carcinoma As Only Disease in the algorithm for \nPanel recommendations. Briefly, following workup (if not previously done), selected patients should be given  systemic therapy for a minimum \nof 3 months. Before considering further therapy, patients should undergo restaging. Multidisciplinary discussion is then recommended for patients \nwith low peritoneal cancer index ( PCI) (≤10), improved or stable disease, \nand no metastasis/extraper itoneal disease to determine status for \ncytoreduction.  Regardless of whether complete or incomplete \ncytoreduction is predicted, these patients have the option of clinical trial \nparticipation or continuing systemic therapy. Only patients who are likely \nto have  complete cytoreduction of all visible nodes/plaques  have the \noption of gastrectomy with cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal \nchemotherapy (IC)/hyper thermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).  \nFor patients with high PCI (>10) and disease progress ion or \nextraperitoneal disease, the Panel recommends systemic therapy, \nclinical trial participation, or best supportive care.  IC/HIPEC  \nOnly case reports and small series are available to support the use of \nIC/HIPEC/pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy (PIPAC) \nin resectable gastric tumors. The HIPEC procedure involves the \ncontinuous circulation of a heated sterile chemotherapy –containing \nsolution throughout the peritoneal cavity following cytoreductive surgery. HIPEC enables the infusion of high doses of chemotherapy directly into \nthe abdominal cavity, where traditional methods of chemotherapy cannot \neffectively reach. Similarly, PIPAC is the introduction of chemotherapy \ndirectly to the abdomen but via aerosol. Note that PIPAC is considered investigational and should only be performed in the context of a clinical \ntrial. Therefore, the focus of this section is on HIPEC and the  Panel’s \nrecommendations.  \nHIPEC  can potentially improve long -term outcomes and provide more \ntreatment options for certain patients with advanced gastric cancer. This \ntechnique is currently under investigation in clinical trials.  In the CYTO -\nCHIP study, which included 277 patients with peritoneal metastases from gastric cancer who underwent cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC (n = \n180) or cytoreductive surgery alone (n = 97), the addition of HIPEC \nimproved OS and recurrence -free survi val, without increasing morbidity \nor mortality.\n253 However, the median PCI remained higher in the HIPEC \ngroup following treatment. Therefore, cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC \nmay be effective for strictly selected patients with limited peritoneal \nmetastases. \nIn a phase II trial, 20 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and positive peritoneal cytology or carcinomatosis who completed systemic \nchemotherapy and laparoscopic HIPEC underwent cytoreduction, \ngastrectomy, and HIPEC.  The 90 -day morbidity and mortality rates were \n70% and 0%, respectively. A median OS of 16.1 months was observed \nfrom the time of cytoreduction, gastrectomy, and HIPEC .

Four patients (11.7%) in the surgery alone group and 5 (14.7%) in the HIPEC group developed serious AEs (P = .839). Multivariate analysis \nfound that the addition of HIPEC to cytoreductive surgery is an independent predictor for better survival.  \nA recent phase III trial, GASTRIPEC -I, investigated cytoreductive surgery \nwith and without HIPEC following preoperative chemotherapy in patients \nwith gastric or EGJ cancers and peritoneal metastasis. No significant \ndifferences were observed in OS between t he two approaches (HR, 0.72; \nP = .1647).\n256 Median PFS (7.1 vs . 3.5 months; P  = .0472) and other \ndistant metastasis -free survival (10.2 vs . 9.2 months; P = .0286) w ere \nimproved with the addition of HIPEC. Of note, some patients were excluded from further treatment and complete cytoreduction after initial \npreoperative chemotherapy due to disease progression, among other \ncauses, and almost half had a PCI of ≥7.\n256 Additionally, an ongoing \nDutch study, PERISCOPE II, is investigating gastrectomy followed by cytoreductive surgery plus HIPEC versus systemic treatment in \nresectable cT3– cT4 gastric cancer with limited peritoneal carcinoma (PCI \n<7). The primary endpoint is OS and secondary endpoints are PFS, toxicity, and  quality of life.\n257 \nDue to limited evidence and a lack of randomized clinical trials to support the use of these methods in resectable tumors, the Panel recommends \nthat IC/HIPEC should be pursued only in select circumstances and after \nmultidisciplinary discussion. Any patient considered for IC/HIPEC should \nundergo pretreatment evaluation  as described in the algorithm for those \nwith documented peritoneal carcinoma as the only disease. This includes staging with chest/abdomen/pelvis CT, diagnostic laparoscopy with washings for PCI and/or cytology -positive disease evaluation, and \nconsideration of a PET scan to rule out distant metastases. For certain \npatients with PCI ≤10 and candidates for complete cytoreduction, \nIC/HIPEC in conjunction with cytoreductive surgery is an option. For \ncertain  patients with PCI >10, IC/HIPEC may be considered in a clinical \ntrial. All treatment decisions should be made in the context of a \nmultidisciplinary tumor board.  \nUnresectable Locally Advanced, Recurrent, or Metastatic \nDisease \nWhen locoregional recurrence develops after prior therapy, the clinician \nshould determine whether surgery is an appropriate option. Surgery \nshould be considered in patients who are medically fit with isolated \nresectable recurrences. Palliative management, which may include \nchemoradiation (only if locally unresectable and not previously received), \nsystemic therapy, and/or best supportive care, is recommended for \npatients with unresectable or metastatic recurrence. If not done previously, \nHER2, PD- L1, CLDN18.2,  and MSI /MMR testing should be performed. \nNGS should be considered via a validated assay.  \nManagement of unresectable or metastatic disease may include either  \nsystemic therapy and/or chemoradiation, with the goal of providing \nsymptom relief and delaying progression and should incorporate symptom- directed best supportive care  (See Palliative/Best Supportive \nCare  below).  The decision to offer palliative/best supportive care alone or \nwith systemic therapy is dependent upon the patient’s performance status. \nThe Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Scale\n \n(ECOG PS) and the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale  (KPS) are \ncommonly used to assess the performance status of patients with \ncancer.258- 260 Patients with higher ECOG PS scores are considered to \nhave worse performance status while lower KPS scores are associated with worse survival for most serious illnesses.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-27 <60% or an ECOG PS score ≥3 should be offered palliative/best \nsupportive care only. Systemic therapy or chemoradiation (only if locally \nunresectable and not previously received) can be offered in addition to \npalliative/best supportive care for patients with better performance status (KPS score of ≥60% or ECOG PS score ≤2).   \nThe survival benefit of systemic therapy compared to palliative/best supportive care alone for patients with advanced gastric cancer has been \ndemonstrated in several randomized trials.\n261- 264 In an early comparison \nbetween chemotherapy and best supportive care versus best supportive \ncare alone, OS (8 vs. 5 months) and time to progression (5 vs. 2 months) \nwere longer in patients receiving chemotherapy in addition to best \nsupportive care for adv anced gastric cancer.261 More patients in the \nchemotherapy group (45%) had an improved or prolonged quality of life for \na minimum of 4 months compared to those who received best supportive \ncare alone (20%). In a randomized phase III study, the addition of second-\nline chemotherapy  with irinotecan significantly prolonged OS compared to \nbest supportive care alone in patients with metastatic or locally advanced \ngastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma (n = 40).262 Median survival was 4 months \nin the irinotecan and best supportive care group compared to 2.4 months \nin the best supportive care alone group. However, the study was closed \nprematurely due to poor accrual. In a larger randomized trial (n = 193), \nsecond- line chemotherapy with irinotecan (or docetaxel) was also found to \nsignificantly improve OS compared to best supportive care alone (5.1 vs. 3.8 months) in patients with advanced gastric cancer.\n263 In another phase \nIII randomized trial, the addition of docetaxel to best supportive care was \nassociated with a survival benefit for patients with advanced \nadenocarcinoma of the esophagus (n = 33), EGJ (n = 59), or stomach (n = \n76) that had progressed on or within 6 months of treatment with platinum \nand fluoropyrimidine- based combination chemotherapy.264 After a median \nfollow- up of 12 months, the median OS was 5.2 months for patients in the \ndocetaxel and best supportive care group compared to 3.6 months for those in the best supportive care alone group ( P = .01). Therefore, the \naddition of systemic therapy to best supportive care can improve the \nquality of life and may prolong survival in patients with advanced gastric \ncancer.  \nSee Principles of Systemic Therapy  in the algorithm for a full list of specific \nregimens for unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic \ndisease. Some of the regimens and dosing schedules included in the \nguidelines are based on extrapolations from published literature and \nclinical practice.  \nChemoradiation for Unresectable Disease  \nChemoradiation alone may be offered to certain  patients who are \nmedically fit with unresectable disease  and if not received previously . \nSince  there are limited data  in gastric cancer , the Panel recommends \nextrapolation of fluorouracil -based chemoradiation regimens with proven \nefficacy in esophageal carcinoma.  Preferred regimens  in this setting  \ninclude FOLFOX as well as fluorouracil and cisplatin . Another \nrecommended regimen is  fluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil or capecitabine) \nand paclitaxel  (category 2B) . Chemoradiation with either FOLFOX or \nfluorouracil and cisplatin  were shown to be effective in a randomized \nphase III trial of patients with unresectable esophageal cancer.265 In a \nrandomized phase III trial (PRODIGE5/ACCORD17), 267 patients with \nunresectable esophageal cancer or those medically unfit for surgery were \nrandomized to receive chemoradiation with either FOLFOX or fluorouracil \nand cisplatin.  The median PFS was 9.7 months in the FOLFOX group \ncompared to 9.4 months in the fluorouracil and cisplatin group ( P = .64). \nAlthough FOLFOX was not associated with a PFS benefit compared to \nfluorouracil and cisplatin, the investigators suggest that FOLFOX might be \na more convenient option for patients who may not be candidates for \nsurgery.265 A trial of patients with stage II –IV esophageal carcinoma \nconfirmed the safety and efficacy of FOLFOX combined with RT with or PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

Surgery is preferred if \nappropriate for patients with resectable and medically operable disease \nafter chemoradiation,  while those found to still have unresectable or \nmedically inoperable and/or metastatic disease should re ceive palliative \nmanagement.  \nFirst -Line Therapy  \nSystemic t herapy can provide palliation, improved survival, and enhanced \nquality of life in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric \ncancer.261- 264 First-line systemic therapy regimens with two  cytotoxic drugs  \nare preferred for patients with advanced disease because of their lower \ntoxicity. The use of three cytotoxic drugs in a regimen should be reserved \nfor patients who are medically fit with excellent PS and easy access to \nfrequent toxicity evaluations.269 Oxaliplatin is generally preferred over \ncisplatin due to lower toxicity.  \nFor HER2 overexpression- positive disease, the addition of trastuzumab to \nchemotherapy with or without pembrolizumab is a treatment option for \ncertain patients in this setting. Preferred regimens for HER2 \noverexpression- negative disease include certain ICIs  combined with \nfluoropyrimidine and platinum -based therapies.  Specifically, an ICI should \nbe added to first -line chemotherapy for patients with PD -L1 CPS ≥1. For \nMSI-H/dMMR tumors, treatment options  also include certain ICIs . See \nTargeted Therapies  below for more information and specific Panel \nrecommendations.  The preferred regimens for HER2- negative disease also include a \nfluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil or capecitabine) combined with either \noxaliplatin270- 272 or cisplatin.270,273- 275 A phase III trial conducted by the \nGerman Study Group compared treatment with fluorouracil and cisplatin to \nFOLFOX  in patients (n = 220) with previously untreated advanced \nadenocarcinoma of the stomach or EGJ.270 Results showed that FOLFOX \n(referred to as FLO) was associated with significantly less toxicity and \nshowed a trend towards improved median PFS (5.8 vs. 3.9 months ; P = \n.77) compared to fluorouracil , leucovorin,  and cisplatin (FLP).270 However, \nthere was no significant difference in median OS (10.7 vs. 8.8 months, \nrespectively) between the two groups. FOLFOX resulted in significantly \nsuperior response rates (41.3% vs. 16.7% ; P = .12 ), time to treatment \nfailure (5.4 vs. 2.3 months ; P < .001 ), PFS (6.0 vs. 3.1 months ; P = .029), \nand improved OS (13.9 vs. 7.2 months) compared with FLP  in patients \n>65 years  (n = 94) . Therefore, FOLFOX offers reduced toxicity and similar \nefficacy compared to fluorouracil plus cisplatin and may also be \nassocia ted with improved efficacy in older adult patients. The safety and \nefficacy of FOLFOX have  also been demonstrated in other \nstudies.271,276,277  \nRegimens combining a platinum  agent  with capecitabine have also been \nevaluated in several studies for patients with advanced gastric cancer.\n275,278,279 A phase III randomized trial (ML 17032) that evaluated the \nefficacy of combined capecitabine and cisplatin compared to fluorouracil \nand cisplatin found that capecitabine was noninferior to fluorouracil  as \nfirst-line therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer .275 Two phase II \ntrials concluded that capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin is active \nand well -tolerated as first -line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.278,279 \nFurthermore, r esults of a meta -analysis suggest  that OS was superior in \npatients with  advanced gastroesophageal cancer treated with \ncapecitabine- based combinations compared to patients treated with \nfluorouracil -based combinations, although no significant difference in PFS PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-29 between treatment groups was seen.280 Another meta -analysis reported \nthat treatment with oxaliplatin- based regimens significantly improved the \npartial response rate, disease progression rate , and 1- year OS rate of \npatients with gastric cancer as compared to cisplatin- based regimens.281 \nTherefore, capecitabine and oxaliplatin is also a preferred  regimen for  first-\nline treatment of patient s with advanced gastric  cancers. The GO2 phase \nIII trial demonstrated that a low -dose capecitabine and oxaliplatin regimen \n(60% of the standard dose) was noninferior in terms of PFS and resulted \nin significantly lower toxicities and better overall treatment utility in  patients \nwho are older  and/or frail with advanced gastroesophageal  cancer s (n = \n514).282 Therefore, this low -dose regimen is recommended as an \nalternative to standard- dose capecitabine and oxaliplatin for patients who \nare older  and/or frail  with advanced or metastatic disease. See Principles \nof Systemic Therapy —Regimens and Dosing Schedules  in the algorithm \nfor recommended modifications to this regimen.  \nFirst-line treatment with irinotecan- based regimens has been explored \nextensively in clinical trials involving patients with advanced or metastatic \ngastroesophageal cancers.274,283- 294 The results of a randomized phase III \nstudy comparing irinotecan and fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) to cisplatin and fluorouracil (CF) in patients with advanced gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma \n(n = 337) showed that FOLFIRI was noninferior to CF in terms of PFS , but \nnot in terms of OS or time to progression.\n289 FOLFIRI was also associated \nwith a more favorable safet y profile. A phase III trial (French Intergroup \nStudy) compared FOLFIRI with ECF as first -line treatment in patients (n = \n416) with advanced or metastatic gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma.294 After \na median follow -up of 31 months, median time to treatment failure was \nsignificantly longer with FOLFIRI than with ECF (5.1 vs. 4.2 months; P =  \n.008).294 However, there were no significant differences in median PFS \n(5.3 vs. 5.8 months; P =  .96), median OS (9.5 vs. 9.7 months; P = .95), or \nresponse rate (39.2% vs. 37.8%). Importantly, FOLFIRI was less toxic and \nbetter tolerated than ECF. Therefore, FOLFIRI may be recommended as an option for first -line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic \ngastric cancer.  \nDocetaxel, cisplatin,  and fluorouracil (DCF) has also demonstrated activity \nin patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.295,296 An \ninternational phase III study (V325) that randomized 445 patients with \nuntreated advanced gastric or EGJ cancer to receive either DCF or CF \nfound that the addition of docetaxel to CF significantly improved time to \nprogression , OS, and ORR .295 However, DCF was associated with \nincreased toxicities including myelosuppression and infectious \ncomplications.  Various modifications of the DCF regimen have \ndemonstrated improved safety in clinical trials of patients with advanced gastric cancer compared to the DCF regimen evaluated in the V325 \nstudy.\n297- 302 Therefore, d ue to concerns regarding toxicity,  dose -modified \nDCF or other DCF modifications should be used as alternative options  to \nthe standard DCF regimen for first -line therapy.298,301,302 Other \nrecommended regimens for first -line therapy include fluorouracil plus \nirinotecan,294 paclitaxel with either cisplatin or carboplatin,303- 305 docetaxel \nwith cisplatin,306,307 docetaxel plus oxaliplatin and fluorouracil,308 and \nsingle -agent fluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil or capecitabine),274,309,310 \ndocetaxel,264,311 or paclitaxel.312,313  \nSecond -Line and Subsequent Therapy  \nThe selection of regimens for second- line or subsequent therapy is \ndependent upon prior therapy and performance status.

PFS was significantly \nlonger in the trifluridine and tipiracil group (2.0 vs. 1. 8 months; HR , 0.57; \n95% CI, 0.47– 0.70; P < .0001).\n321,322 The efficacy benefits of trifluridine \nand tipiracil were observed regardless of whether or not the patient had undergone previous gastrectomy.323 The most frequently reported grade \n3–4 toxicities were neutropenia (38%), leukopenia (21%), anemia (19%), \nand lymphocytopenia (19%).321 Patients ≥65 years had a higher incidence \nof moderate renal impairment compared to the overall study population \n(31% vs. 17%).322 In the  trifluridine and tipiracil arm versus the placebo \narm, the ORR was 4.5% versus 2.1% , respectively, and the disease \ncontrol rate was 44.1% versus 14.5%.321 However, trifluridine and tipiracil \nproduced substantial grade 3– 4 toxicities. Therefore, this treatment should \nbe considered for a very select population of patients with low -volume \ngastric cancer who have minimal or no symptoms and the ability to swallow pills.  Trifluridine and tipiracil is recommended as a preferred \ncategory 1 treatment option for patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer in the third -line or subsequent setting.  \nOther recommended regimens for second -line or subsequent therapy \ninclude single -agent  ramucirumab (category 1),\n324 irinotecan and \ncisplatin ,271,325 ramucirumab combined with irinotecan326 or FOLFIRI,327 \nand irinotecan and docetaxel (category 2B).328 Options that are useful in \ncertain circumstances include pembrolizumab,158,329,330 nivolumab and \nipilimumab,331 or dostarlimab- gxly332 for MSI -H/dMMR  tumors ; \npembrolizumab  for TMB -H (≥10 mutations/megabase) tumors333; \nentrectinib,  larotrectinib , or repotrectinib for NTRK  gene fusion- positive \ntumors334- 336; dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAF  V600E -mutated \ntumors337; and selpercatinib for RET  gene fusion- positive tumors.338 See \nTargeted Therapies  below for more information on these agents .   \nTargeted Therapies  \nAt present, several targeted therapeutic agents,  including HER2 -directed \ntherapies , ICIs, and various kinase inhibitors , have been approved by the \nFDA for advanced gastric cancer.

Median follow -up was 19 months and 17 months, \nrespectively, in the two groups. Results showed significant improvement in \nmedian OS with the addit ion of trastuzumab to chemotherapy in  patients \nwith HER2 overexpression- positive  disease  (13.8 vs. 11 months, \nrespectively; P = .046). This study established trastuzumab in combination \nwith cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine as a treatment  option for patient s with \nHER2 overexpression- positive  advanced gastr oesophageal  \nadenocarcinoma. In a post -hoc subgroup analysis, the addition of \ntrastuzumab to chemotherapy further  improved OS in patients whose \ntumors were IHC 2+ and FISH  positive or IHC 3+ (n = 446; 16 vs. 11.8 \nmonths; HR , 0.65) compared to those with tumors that were IHC 0 or 1+ \nand FISH positive (n = 131; 10 vs. 8.7 months; HR , 1.07).  \nThe phase II  HERXO  trial assessed the combination of trastuzumab with \ncapecitabine and oxaliplatin in the first -line treatment of patients with \nHER2 overexpression- positive  advanced gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma  \n(n = 45) .339 At a median follow -up of 13.7 months, PFS and OS were 7.1 \nand 13.8 months, respectively, and 8.9%, 37.8% , and 31.1% of patients \nachieved a CR, partial response,  and stable disease. The most frequently \nreported grade 3 or higher AEs  were diarrhea (26.6%), fatigue (15.5%), \nnausea (20%) , and vomiting (13.3%). In a retrospective study of 34 \npatients with  HER2 overexpression- positive  metastatic gastric or EGJ \nadenocarcinoma, the combination of trastuzumab with a modified FOLFOX regimen (mFOLFOX6) improved toler ability compared with the \ncisplatin plus fluorouracil regimen in previously untreated patients with \nHER2 overexpression- positive  tumors.340 The ORR with this regimen was \n41% and median PFS and OS were 9.0 months and 17.3 months, \nrespectively. The most frequent grade 3– 4 toxicities were neutropenia \n(8.8%) and neuropathy (17.6%). These results suggest that the combinations of trastuzumab  with capecitabine and oxaliplatin or with \nmFOLFOX are  effective regimens with acceptable safety profiles in \npatients with HER2 overexpression- positive  gastroesophageal cancers.  \nTrastuzumab should be added to first -line chemotherapy for patients with \nadvanced HER2 overexpression- positive adenocarcinoma (combination \nwith a fluoropyrimidine and a platinum agent is preferred [category 1 for \ncisplatin\n145; category 2A for oxaliplatin]). Pembrolizumab can also be \nadded to this regimen for treatment of advanced HER2 overexpression-\npositive adenocarcinoma  341 (see Pembrolizumab  below).

Median OS was 20 months in the pembrolizumab arm compared to \n16.9 months in the placebo arm (HR, 0.87; 95% CI , 0.72–1.06; P = .084) , \nwith the PD-L1 subgroup analys is following a similar trend to the PFS \nanalysis .344 The third interim analysis was consistent with the second.  \nImproved ORR ( 72.6% vs. 59.8 %) and median duration of response ( 11.2 \nvs. 9  months) was observed with the addition of pembrolizumab compared \nto placebo.  CRs were also more frequent in the pembrolizumab group \ncompared to placebo (14 % vs. 11 %).344 Similar incidence of AEs  was \nobserved in the pembrolizumab and placebo groups, the most common \nbeing diarrhea, nausea , and anemia.343,344 Based on KEYNOTE -811, in \n2021 the FDA approved pembrolizumab in combination with trastuzumab \nplus fluoropyrimidine-  and platinum -containing chemotherapy for locally \nadvanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or  EGJ \nadenocarcinoma  in first -line. The approval was modified in 2023 for \npatients in this setting whose tumor has  PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1. Therefore, \npembrolizumab combined with trastuzumab and fluoropyrimidine and \nplatinum -based chemotherapy is a category 1  preferred first-line therapy \noption f or treatment of patients with advanced HER2 overexpression-\npositive adenocarcinoma  and PD -L1 CPS ≥1. \nHER2 Overexpression -Negative Tumors  \nThe randomized phase III KEYNOTE -859 trial investigated pembrolizumab \nplus chemotherapy versus  placebo plus chemotherapy in treatment -naïve \npatients with advanced HER2- negative gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma.345 \nAt a median 31 -month follow -up, OS and PFS were favorable for the \npembrolizumab combination versus placebo.  More specifically, i n the PD -\nL1 CPS ≥10 subgroup, median OS was significantly longer with \npembrolizumab compared with placebo (15.7 vs. 11.8 months; HR, 0.65; P \n< .0001) , and median PFS was also longer with pembrolizumab (8.1 vs. \n5.6 months; HR, 0.62; P  < .0001). Objective responses were observed in 61% of patients with pembrolizumab versus 43% with placebo.345 In the \nPD-L1 CPS ≥1 subgroup, median OS was 13 months versus 11.4 months  \n(HR, 0.74; P  < .0001)  and median PFS  was 6.9 months versus 5.6 months \n(HR, 0.72; P  < .0001)  for pembrolizumab versus placebo, respectively . \nObjective responses were observed in 52 % compared to 43 %. Incidence \nof AEs were similar between the two treatment arms, with the most common grade 3– 5 AEs being anemia and decreased neutrophils.\n345 \nBased on this study, the FDA granted approval for pembrolizumab in \ncombination with fluoropyrimidine-  and platinum -based chemotherapy for \nlocally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic HER2- negative gastric or \nEGJ cancer  in first -line therapy . \nThe Panel includes  pembrolizumab in combination with fluoropyrimidine-  \nand platinum -based chemotherapy  as a preferred option for first -line \ntreatment of advanced HER2 overexpression- negative gastric cancer with \nPD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 if no prior ICI therapy or  no tumor progression while on an \nICI. This is  a category 1 preferred option when PD -L1 CPS is ≥5.  \nMSI-H/dMMR Tumors  \nPembrolizumab was FDA approved in 2017 for the treatment of patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic MSI -H or dMMR solid tumors that have \nprogressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory \nalternative treatment options.  This first -ever tissue - and site- agnostic \napproval was based on data from 149 patients with MSI -H/dMMR cancers \n(90 patients had colorectal cancer) enrolled across five multicenter single-\narm clinical trials.158,329,330 The ORR was 39.6% and responses lasted ≥6 \nmonths for 78% of those whose disease responded to pembrolizumab. \nThere were 11 CRs  and 48 partial responses, and the ORR was similar \nirrespective of cancer type.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-33 (DOR)  was 47.5 months. Among the 42 patients with gastric cancer , the \nORR was 31%.346  \nA few studies investigating pembrolizumab monotherapy  and/or plus \nchemotherapy in advanced gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma included \npatients whose tumors were MSI -H. In the phase II  KEYNOTE- 059 trial of \na cohort of previously treated recurrent or metastatic gastric and EGJ \ncancers , four out of seven  patients with an MSI-H tumor obtained  an \nobjective response with pembrolizumab  monotherapy , with an ORR of \n57.1%. Median OS and PFS were not reached among these same \npatients.155,347 Previously treated patients in the phase III KEYNOTE- 061 \ntrial received either pembrolizum ab or paclitaxel.348 Among the 5.3%  of \npatients with  MSI-H tumors , median OS was not reached with \npembrolizumab compared to 8.1 months with paclitaxel only . Median PFS \nwas 17.8 months and ORR was 46.7 % in patients with MSI -H tumor who \nreceived pembrolizumab versus  3.5 months  and 16.7%, respectively,  with \npaclitaxel  alone.155,348 In the phase III KEYNOTE -062 trial, treatment -naïve \npatients received pembrolizumab ± chemotherapy.349 Similar to the other \ntrials, m edian OS  was not reached in the 7% of patients with MSI-H \nuntreated locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic disease who \nreceived pembrolizumab ± chemotherapy versus  8.5 months with \nchemotherapy . Median PFS was 11.2 months among these patients with \npembrolizumab and not reached with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy \nversus 6.6 months with chemotherapy alone.155,349 ORR was 57 .1% and \n64.7% with pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, \nrespectively , compared to 36.8% with chemotherapy alone.155 Similar \nincidences of treatment -related all -grade or  grade 3– 5 AEs were observed \nwith pembrolizumab and were lower than chemotherapy  in the two phase \nIII trials .348- 350  \nBoth pembrolizumab monotherapy  and pembrolizumab in combination \nwith fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin are recommended as category 2A \npreferred first-line therapy options  for patients with advanced MSI-H/dMMR  gastric cancer, independent of PD -L1 expression.  \nPembrolizumab monotherapy is also a category 2A option useful in certain \ncircumstances for MSI -H/dMMR tumors in second - and subsequent -line. \nTMB -H Tumors  \nIn June 2020, the FDA approved pembrolizumab for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic TMB -H solid tumors, as determined by an FDA -\napproved test, that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options . This approval was \nbased on a prospective analysis of 102 patients enrolled in the KEYNOTE -\n158 trial who had tumors identified as TMB -H.\n333 The ORR for these \npatients was 29%, with a 4% CR rate. The median duration of response \nwas not reached, with 50% of patients having response duration for  ≥24 \nmonths.333 Based on these data, pembrolizumab may be used for the \nsecond- line or subsequent treatment of TMB -H gastroesophageal tumors.  \nHowever, it should be noted that no patients with gastroesophageal cancer were included in this TMB analysis from the KEYNOTE- 158 trial.  \nNivolumab \nHER2 Overexpression -Negative Tumors  \nAs mentioned, nivolumab is a monoclonal PD -1 antibody . It was approved \nby the FDA in April 2021, in combination with fluoropyrimidine-  and \nplatinum -based chemotherapy, for the first -line treatment of patients with \nadvanced or metastatic gastric cancer.  This approval was based on \nresults from the phase III Checkmate- 649 trial, which randomized 1581 \npatients with previously untreated, HER2- negative, unresectable gastric, \nEGJ, or esophageal adenocarcinoma to receive chemotherapy alone or \nnivolumab plus chem otherapy (capecitabine and oxaliplatin or \nmFOLFOX).351 The 3- year follow -up was consistent with initial efficacy \nresults.

OS and PFS \nbenefit was maintained with nivolumab plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in the 5- year follow -up.\n353 These patients also had an \nORR of 60%, and 13% achieved CR with nivoluma b plus chemotherapy \ncompared to an ORR of 45% and CR rate of 7% with chemotherapy.352 In \nthe PD -L1 CPS ≥1 cohort, median OS for nivolumab plus chemotherapy \nwas 13.8 versus 11.3 months with chemotherapy (HR, 0.75) and median \nPFS was 7.5 versus 6.9 months (HR, 0.77), respectively.352,353 Among all \npatients, 59% of those in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and \n44% of those in the chemotherapy alone group experienced grade 3– 4 \ntreatment -related AEs, remaining consistent in the 3- year follow -up.351,352 \nThe most common any -grade treatment -related AEs were nausea, \ndiarrhea, and peripheral neuropathy across both groups. Sixteen \ntreatment -related deaths occurred in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy \ngroup compared to four in the chemotherapy alone group.351 Therefore, \nnivolumab plus fluoropyrimidine-  and oxaliplatin- based chemotherapy  is a \npreferred first -line treatment option for patients with HER2- negative gastric \ntumors with PD -L1 expression levels by CPS ≥1 if no prior ICI therapy or \nno tumor progression while on an ICI . This combination is a category 1 \npreferred option when CPS is ≥ 5.   \nMSI-H/dMMR Tumors  \nAbout 3% of patients enrolled in Checkmate -649 had MSI -H \ntumors .351,352 In the 3 -year follow -up, the OS benefit observed with \nnivolumab plus chemotherapy was better  for those with MSI -H tumors  \nthan chemotherapy alone. This was true in patients who had MSI -H \ntumors with PD -L1 CPS ≥5 (n = 34; 44.8 vs. 8.8 months; HR, 0.29) and \nin all randomized patients with MSI -H tumors (n  = 44; 38.7 vs. 12.3 \nmonths; HR, 0.34).352 The Checkmate -649 trial also randomized some  patients to nivolumab \nplus ipilimumab or chemotherapy . At a minimum 24- month follow -up, \npatients with tumors having PD -L1 CPS ≥5 and all randomized patients \ndid not have improved OS, PFS, or ORR with nivolumab plus ipilimumab \nversus chemotherapy alone.331 However, patients with MSI -H tumors \ntreated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab had improved median OS versus \nchemotherapy  (not reached vs. 10 months; HR, 0.28) . ORR was also \nimproved  with the combination versus  chemotherapy (70% vs. 57% ) in \nthose with  an MSI-H tumor . There was no survival benefit in the \nmicrosatellite stable cohort.331      \nFor MSI -H/dMMR tumors , independent of PD -L1 status, the Panel \nrecommends nivolumab plus fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin as a \ncategory 2A preferred option in first-line. The Panel also recommends \nnivolumab plus ipilimumab as a category 2A preferred option in first -line \nand a category 2A option useful in certain circumstances in second-  and \nsubsequent -line for patients with MSI -H/dMMR tumors.  \nTislelizumab- jsgr \nAnother PD -1 inhibitor, tislelizumab, was recently approved by the FDA in \ncombination with fluoropyrimidine-  and platinum -based chemotherapy for \nthe treatment of unresectable or metastatic HER2- negative gastric or EGJ \nadenocarcinoma with PD -L1 CPS ≥1. The randomized, global multicenter \nphase III trial RATIONALE -305 investigated the use of tislelizumab plus \nchemotherapy (investigator’s choice, capecitabine plus oxaliplatin or \nfluorouracil plus cisplatin) in the first -line setting for unresectable locally \nadvanced or metastatic gastric of EGJ adenocarcinoma.354 Patients \nreceived either tislelizumab plus chemotherapy (n = 501) or placebo plus \nchemotherapy (n = 496). In all randomized patients, median OS for \ntislelizumab was 15 months versus 12.9 months with placebo (HR, 0.80; P \n= .001).

In the tislelizumab arm, 23% experienced serious treatment -related AEs and 31% experienced immune- related AEs, \ncompared to 15% and 12% with placebo,  respectively.\n354 Based on these \ndata, the Panel recommends tislelizumab in combination with \nfluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil or capecitabine) and platinum (oxaliplatin or \ncisplatin) as a first-line treatment option for patients whose tumors are PD -\nL1 CPS ≥ 1, if no prior ICI therapy or no tumor progression while on an ICI . \nFor tumors with PD -L1 CPS ≥ 5, this is a category 1, preferred option.  \nZolbetuximab -clzb \nThe FDA recently approved zolbetuximab combined with fluoropyrimidine-  \nand platinum -based therapy for patients with HER2- negative, CLDN18.2-\npositive , unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or EGJ  \nadenocarcinoma in the first -line setting.  Zolbetuximab is a novel \nmonoclonal antibody targeting the tight junction protein, CLDN18.2, that \ndemonstrated significant survival benefit in two global,  randomized, \nmulticenter phase III trials  in this setting.169,179 \nIn the SPOTLIGHT trial,  565 treatment -naïve patients with HER2 -negative, \nCLDN18.2 -positive , unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or \nEGJ tumors received either zolbetuximab plus mFOLFOX6 (n = 283) or \nplacebo plus mFOLFOX 6 (n = 282).169 Median PFS was 10.61 months \nwith zolbetuximab compared to 8.67 months with placebo, with the HR for disease progression or death being 0.75  (P = .0066) . Median OS was  also longer  with zolbetuximab at 18.23  months  versus placebo at 15.54  months  \n(HR for risk of death , 0.75; P  = .0053) . ORR and median DOR were similar \nbetween treatment groups.\n169 In the GLOW trial,  507 untreated patients \nwith unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -negative, \nCLDN18.2 -positive gastric  or EGJ adenocarcinoma received either \nzolbetuximab plus CAPOX  (n = 254)  or placebo plus CAPOX  (n = 253) .179 \nMedian PFS was longer in the zolbetuximab arm versus the placebo arm (8.21  vs. 6.8 months; HR, 0.687; P  = .0007) . Median OS  was also \nimproved with zolbetuximab compared to placebo (14.39 vs . 12.16 \nmonths; HR, 0.771; P  = .0118).  In the zolbetuximab group, ORR and DOR \nwere 42.5% and 6.14 months versus placebo, which was 40.3% and 6.08 months, respectivel y.\n179  \nIn both studies, treatment -emergent all grade AEs with a >10% difference \nbetween zolbetuximab and placebo arms were nausea and vomiting. \nThese events were also accounted for  in the most frequent AEs of grade 3 \nor higher. Other AEs of grade 3 or higher in the GLOW trial were anemia and neutropenia, while decreased appetite was also observed in the \nSPOTLIGHT trial.\n169,179 Based on these data, fluoropyrimidine- based \nchemotherapy plus oxaliplatin and zolbetuximab is a  category 1, preferred  \nfirst-line therapy option for patients with unresectable locally advanced, \nrecurrent or metastatic gastric cancer whose tumors are HER2- negative \nand CLDN18.2- positive.  \nRamucirumab \nRamucirumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR )-2 \nantibody, has shown favorable results in patients with previously treated \nadvanced or metastatic  gastroesophageal cancers in two phase III clinical \ntrials.324,355 An international randomized multicenter phase III trial \n(REGARD) demonstrated a survival benefit for ramucirumab in patients \nwith advanced gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma progressing after first -line \nchemotherapy.324 In this study, 355 patients were randomized to receive PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

Median OS was 5.2 months \nin patients treated with ramucirumab compared to 3.8 months for those in \nthe placebo group ( P = .047). Ramucirumab was associated with higher  \nrates of hypertension than placebo (16% vs. 8%), whereas rates of other AEs were similar.\n324  \nAn international phase III randomized trial (RAINBOW) evaluated \npaclitaxel with or without ramucirumab in patients (n = 665) with metastatic \ngastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma progressing on first -line chemotherapy.355 \nPatients randomized to receive ramucirumab plus paclitaxel (n = 330) had \nsignificantly longer median OS (9.63 months) compared to patients \nreceiving paclitaxel alone (n = 335; 7.36 months; P < .0001). The median \nPFS was 4.4 months and 2.86 months, respectively , and the ORR was \n28% for ramucirumab plus paclitaxel compared to 6% for paclitaxel alone \n(P = .0001). N eutropenia and hypertension were more common with \nramucirumab plus paclitaxel. An exposure -response analysis revealed that \nramucirumab was a signif icant predictor of OS and PFS in both studies.356 \nBased on these  results, ramucirumab ( as a single agent or in combination \nwith paclitaxel ) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with \nadvanced gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma refractory to or progressive following first -line therapy with platinum - or fluoropyrimidine- based \nchemotherapy. The guidelines recommend r amucirumab as a single agent \n(category 1 , other recommended) or in combination with paclitaxel \n(category 1; preferred) as treatment options for second- line or subsequent \ntherapy  in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma.  \nRamucirumab combined with FOLFIRI is a category 2A other recommended  option for second- line or subsequent therapy . In a multi -\ninstitutional retrospective analysis of 29 patients with advanced gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma who received FOLFIRI plus ramucirumab in the \nsecond- line setting, the ORR was 23% with a disease control rate of \n79%.\n327 Median PFS was 6 months and median OS was 13.4 months. Six - \nand 12- month OS were 90% and 41%, respectively. No new safety signals were observed with the combination treatment , making FOLFIRI plus \nramucirumab a safe, non -neurotoxic alternative to ramucirumab plus \npaclitaxel. Ramucirumab combined with irinotecan is also a category 2A \nother recommended option for second -line or subsequent therapy for \npatients with advanced gastric cancer.326 \nDue to the results of  the international phase III RAINFALL trial , in which \ntreatment with ramucirumab did not reduce the risk of disease progression \nor death in treatment -naïve patients with metastatic gastroesophageal \nadenocarcinoma, the addition of ramucirumab to first -line chemotherapy is \nnot recommended at this time .357  \nFam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki \nFam-trastuzumab deruxtecan- nxki is an antibody -drug conjugate \nconsisting of trastuzumab and a cytotoxic topoisomerase I inhibitor connected by a cleavable tetrapeptide- based linker.

This second -ever tissue -agnostic FDA approval for \nthe treatment of patients with cancer  was based on data from three \nmulticenter , singl e-arm clinical trials . Patients  with prospectively  \nidentified NTRK  gene fusion -positive cancers  were enrolled  into one of \nthree protocols : a phase I  trial involving adults  (LOXO -TRK-14001) , a \nphase I –II trial  involving  children  (SCOUT) , and a phase II  trial involving  \nadolescents and adults  (NAVIGATE) .335 A total of 55 patients with \nunresectable or metastatic solid tumors harboring an NTRK gene fusion \nwho experienced disease progression following systemic therapy were \nenrolled across the three trials and treated  with larotrectinib . The most \ncommon cancer types represented were salivary gland tumors, soft \ntissue sarcoma, infantile fibrosarcoma, and thyroid cancer. In an updated \npooled analysis of the 3 trials (n  = 153), t he ORR was 7 9%, with a  CR \nrate of 16%.364 At a median follow -up of 12.9 months,  23% of patients \nwho had responses experienced a progression event. Median DOR, PFS, and OS were 35.2 months, 28.3 months , and 44.4 months, \nrespectively. AEs were predominantly grade 1 –2, the most common \nbeing fatigue, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  and alanine \naminotransferase (ALT)  levels, vomiting, constipation , and dizz iness.\n364 \nThe SCOUT (Clinical Trial ID: NCT02637687 ) and NAVIGATE (Clinical \nTrial ID: NCT02576431 ) trials  are ongoing.   \nIn 2019, the FDA approved the second TRK inhibitor , entrectinib, for the \nsame indications as larotrectinib, as well as for adult patients with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-38 metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are  ROS1  positive . The approval of \nentrectinib for the treatment of NTRK gene fusion- positive tumors was \nbased on data from three multicenter , single -arm phase I and phase II \nclinical trials . A total of 54 patients aged ≥18 years with metastatic  or \nlocally advanced NTRK gene fusion- positive solid tumors were enrolled \ninto one of the three protocols (ALKA -372-001, STARTRK -1, and \nSTARTRK -2).334 The most common cancer types represented were \nsarcoma, NSCLC, mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, breast, \nthyroid, and colorectal. The ORR across the three trials was 57% , with a \nCR rate of 7% . Response duration was ≥6 months for 68% of patients \nand ≥12 months for 45% of patients. The median duration of response \nwas 10 months. The most common grade 3 –4 treatment -related AEs \nwere increased weight and anemia while the most common serious \ntreatment -related AEs were nervous system disorders. STARTRK -2 \n(Clinical Trial ID: NCT02568267 ) is ongoing.  \nRepotrectinib was FDA approved in 2023 for patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic ROS1 -positive NSCLC.  It was  given accelerated \napproval  by the FDA  in 2024 for similar indications to larotrectinib and \nentrectinib  in patients with NTRK  gene fusion -positive solid tumor s. This \nwas based on data from the phase I/II TRIDENT- 1 trial  investigating \nrepotrectinib in previously tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI)-treated and TKI -\ntreatment –naïve patients with NSCLC and NTRK + solid tumors  (ongoing, \nClinical Trial ID: NCT03093116 ).336 The most common tumor types were \nNSCLC, salivary gland, thyroid, and soft tissue sarcoma. Confirmed ORR \nwas 58% in the TKI -naïve group and 50% in the previously treated \ngroup.  The 12 -month DOR and PFS were 86% and 56%  for the TKI -\nnaïve patients, respectively, and 39% and 22%, respectively, for the previously treated patients.  Dizziness was the most common treatment -\nemergent  AE of any grade, and AEs grade 3 or higher  were observed in \n51% of patients.\n336  These data demonstrate that these NTRK inhibitors  induce durable and \nclinically meaningful responses in patients with NTRK  gene fusion-\npositive tumors  with m anageable safety profile s. Entrectinib, larotrectinib , \nor repotrectinib  are recommended as  first-line (category 2B)  and second -\nline or subsequent  treatment options (category 2A)  for patients  with \nNTRK  gene fusion -positive gastric  tumors.  \nDostarlimab -gxly  \nDostarlimab -gxly, an anti -PD-1 antibody, was approved by the FDA in \nAugust 2021 for the treatment of patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced solid tumors that have progressed on or following prior \ntreatment, who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options, and who \nhad not previously received a PD- 1 or PD -L1 inhibitor.  This approval was \nbased on data from the nonrandomized phase 1 multi -cohort GARNET \ntrial that evaluated the safety and antitumor activity of dostarlimab- gxly in \npatients with dMMR solid tumors who had not received prior PD- 1, PDL -1, \nor CTLA4 inhibitors.\n365,366 The majority of patients had endometrial or GI \ncancers. At median follow -up of 27.7 months, the ORR was 44% and DOR \nwas not reached.366 Median PFS and OS were 6.9 months and not \nreached, respectively.  The m ost common treatment -related AEs of any \ngrade were fatigue, diarrhea, asthenia, pruritus , and hypothyroidism. \nImmune- related AEs that occurred in 34% of patients included \nhypothyroidism, elevated ALT , and arthralgia.366 Based on these data, \ndostarlimab -gxly is a category 2A, preferred option for first -line therapy  for \nMSI-H/dMMR tumors. It is also  useful in certain circumstances for second-\nline therapy in patients with MSI -H/dMMR gastric tumors  whose disease is \nprogressing on or following prior treatment that does not include immuno-\noncology therapy and who have no satisfactory alternatives.     \nDabrafenib and Trametinib  \nIn June 2022, the FDA granted tumor -agnostic approval for the \ncombination of dabrafenib, a  BRAF  inhibitor, and trametinib, a MEK PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

This \napproval was based in part on data from the phase II BRF117019 and \nNCI-MATCH trials, which enrolled a combined 131 adult patients with \nvarious BRAF  V600E -mutated tumor types.337 In subprotocol H (EAY131-\nH) of the NCI -MATCH platform trial, patients with BRAF  V600E -mutated \nsolid tumors (except for melanoma, thyroid cancer, or colorectal cancer) received combined dabrafenib and trametinib continuously until disease \nprogression or intolerable toxicity. The ORR was 38% ( P < .0001) and \nPFS was 11.4 months.\n337 The median OS in this cohort was 29 months. \nFor the 131 patients across both trials, the ORR was 41%. The most \ncommon treatment -related AEs included pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, rash, \nchills, headache, hemorrhage, cough, and vomiting.337 Based on these \ndata, dabrafenib and trametinib may be used for second- line or \nsubsequent therapy (category 2A) for patients with BRAF  V600E -mutated \ngastroesophageal tumors.     \nSelpercatinib  \nIn September 2022, the FDA granted tumor -agnostic approval for \nselpercatinib, a TKI , for treatment of patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic solid tumors with RET  gene fusions who have progressed \nfollowing prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment \noptions . This approval was based on an interim analysis of data from the \nongoing phase I/II LIBRETTO -001 trial, which evaluated 41 patients with \nRET fusion- positive tumors (other than NSCLC and thyroid cancer)  who \nreceived selpercatinib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n338 The ORR was 44% with a duration of response of 25 months. \nThe most common treatment -related AEs included edema, diarrhea, \nfatigue, dry mouth, hypertension, and abdominal pain. The most common \ngrade 3 or higher treatment -related AEs were hypertension, increased \nALT, and increased AST .338 Based on these data, selpercatinib may be used for second- line or subsequent therapy (category 2A) for patients with \nRET gene fusion -positive gastroesophageal tumors.  \nLeucovorin Shortage  \nLeucovorin is indicated  with certain fluorouracil- based regimens. However, \nthere is currently a shortage of leucovorin in the United States.367 There \nare no specific data to guide management under these circumstances, and all proposed strategies are empiric. One is the use of levoleucovorin, \nwhich is commonly used in Europe. A levoleucovorin dose of 200 mg/m\n2 is \nequivalent to 400 mg/m2 of standard leucovorin. Another option is to use \nlower doses of leucovorin in all patients, since lower doses are likely to be \nas efficacious as higher doses, based on several studies in patients with \ncolorectal cancer.368- 370 However, the Panel recommends use of these \nregimens without leucovorin in situations where leucovorin is not available.  \nSurvivorship \nIn addition to survivorship care relevant to all survivors of cancer (see NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship  [available at www.nccn.org\n]), survivors \nof gastric cancer have special long- term care needs due to the nature of \ntheir illness and treatments. Therefore, screening and management of long- term sequelae are important for all survivors of gastric cancer. \nHowever, due to a lack of large randomized trials, the survivorship management recommendations provided by the Panel are based on \nsmaller studies , clinical experience, and other consensus \nrecommendations and guidelines .\n371- 374 Survivorship care planning should \ninclude appropriate timing of transfer of care to a primary care physician and maintenance of a therapeutic relationship with the primary care \nphysician throughout life. The oncology team and primary care physician \nshould have clearly delineated roles in survivorship care, with these roles \ncommunicated to the patient.

Surveillance should be performed in conjunction with good \nroutine medical care, including routine health maintenance, preventive \ncare, and cancer screening.  Survivors of gastric cancer should be \ncounseled to maintain a healthy body weight, adopt a physically active lifestyle, consume a healthy diet with an emphasis on plant -based \nsources, and limit alcohol intake. Smoking cessation should also be \nencouraged, as appropriate. Additional preventive health measures and \nimmunizations should be performed as indicated under the care of or in \nconjunction with a primary care physician.  \nCommon issues facing survivors of  gastric cancer include weight loss, \ndiarrhea, chemotherapy -induced neuropathy, and fatigue. Weight loss and \nfatigue can be effectively managed by monitoring patients’ weight \nregularly, encouraging more frequent consumption of smaller meals \nwithout fluid i ntake, and encouraging physical activity and energy \nconservation measures. Anti -diarrheal medications, bulk -forming agents , \nor diet manipulation can be considered to treat diarrhea. Duloxetine can \nbe considered to treat pai nful chemotherapy -induced neuropathy but is \nineffective for numbness or tingling. Referral to occupational, \nrehabilitation, and/or physical therapy should be considered for patients \nwith chemotherapy -induced neuropathy who are at risk for falls.  \nOsteopenia/osteoporosis is another common long -term sequelae in \nsurvivors of gastric cancer, caused by deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, \nphosphorus, and other vitamins and minerals. Supplementation with \nvitamin D, and treatment with other therapies, has been shown to improve \nbone health in these patients.\n375,376 Therefore, bone density should be \nscreened at regular intervals and low bone density should be managed as \nper established national guidelines.377 \nIn addition to the issues discussed above, survivors of gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy face other long- term health issues  (usually \nlifetime)  including postprandial fullness, nutritional deficiencies ( including \nvitamins B\n12 and D , calcium, iron, and zinc), dumping syndrome,  and bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine (blind loop) . See Principles of \nSurvivorship in the algorithm  for specific management recommendations. \nLifelong monitoring and management of nutritional sequelae of \ngastrectomy should be established with appropriate practitioners and \nspecialists.  \nSurvivors who undergo  gastrectomy are at risk for long- term health issues, \nas they have been shown to have greater restrictions and a significantly \nworse quality of life compared to those who receive partial gastrectomy.378-\n380 A prospective study of 254 patients who were followed for 5 years \nfollowing gastrectomy (partial or total) as treatment for gastric cancer \nfound that symptoms including diarrhea, dysphagia, reflux, eating \nrestrictions, physical functioning, cognitive funct ioning, and fatigue \nnegatively impacted the patients’ long- term quality of life.381 Survivors of \ngastrectomy also have unique nutritional needs due to frequent vitamin \nand mineral deficiencies and other GI dysfunctions.382 Studies have shown \nthat long- term anemia  and deficiencies in nutrients such as  iron, vitamin \nB12, vitamin D, and zinc  can occur  in patients treated with gastrectomy for \ngastric cancer.383- 386 Supplementation of nutrients such as vitamin B 12387 \nand iron388 is safe and effective for reversing these deficiencies.  It is \nrecommended to supplement and monitor levels of vitamin B 12 and D, iron, \nand calcium. Daily multivitamin and mineral complexes that include other vitamins and nutrients, as listed in the algorithm , are recommended as \nclinically indicated.   \nDumping syndrome, which results from rapid emptying of the stomach into \nthe small bowel, is another concern for survivors of total gastrectomy. \nPatients suffering from early dumping syndrome (within 30 minutes of \neating a meal) may experience palpitations, diarrhea, nausea , and cramps \nwhile those with late dumping syndrome (within 2– 3 hours of eating a \nmeal) may experience dizziness, hunger, cold sweats , and faintness. A \nlarge study of 1153 total survivors of gastrectomy reported that 67.6% and \n38.4% of pat ients experienced early and late dumping, respectively.\n389 To PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-41 help manage the symptoms of dumping syndrome, the P anel recommends \nmaking dietary changes including frequent eating throughout the day, \navoiding fluid intake with meals, and consuming a diet high in protein and \nfiber and low in simple carbohydrates and sugars.  \nPatients who undergo gastrectomy can experience small intestinal \nbacterial overgrowth, a shift in the microbiome of  the small intestine.390,391 \nSmall intestin al bacterial overgrowth (blind loop) can have nonspecific \nsymptoms and lead to maldigestion and malabsorption.391,392 Modifications \nto diet391 and use of antibiotics such as rifaximin can be effective in \ntreating certain patients.393,394 The Panel recommends  consideration of \nantibiotic treatment and a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates.   \nThe Panel recommends the development of a survivorship care plan that \nincludes i nformation on treatments received (surgeries, RT, and systemic \ntherapies), follow -up care, surveillance, screening recommendations, and \npost-treatment needs regarding acute, late,  and long- term treatment -\nrelated effects and health risks. The roles  of oncologists, primary care \nphysicians, and subspecialty care physicians in the survivorship care plan should be clearly delineated. Long- term survivorship care plans should \nalso include a periodic assessment of ongoing needs and identification of \nappropriate resources, including timing of transfer of care, if appropriate . \nPalliative/Best Supportive Care  \nThe goals of palliative/best supportive care are to prevent, reduce, and \nrelieve suffering and improve the quality of life for patients and their \ncaregivers, regardless of the stage of the disease or the need for other \ntherapies. In patients with advanced or metastatic  gastric cancer, \npalliative/best supportive care provides symptom relief  and improvement \nin overall quality of life and may result in prolongation of life. This is \nespecially true when a multimodality interdisciplinary approach is pursued. \nTherefore, a mul timodality interdisciplinary approach to palliative/best \nsupportive care of  patients with  gastric cancer is encouraged.  Bleeding  \nAcute bleeding is common in patients with gastric cancer and may be tumor -related or a consequence of therapy. Patients with acute severe \nbleeding (hematemesis or melena) should undergo prompt endoscopic \nassessment.\n395 The efficacy of endoscopic treatment for bleeding in \npatients with gastric cancer is not well -studied, but limited available data \nsuggest that while endoscopic therapies may be effective as initial \ntreatment, the rate of recurrent bleeding is very high.396,397 Widely available \noptions for endoscopic therapies include injection therapy, mechanical \ntherapy (eg, endoscopic clip placement), ablative therapy (eg, argon \nplasma coagulation or other laser therapy), or a combination of \nmodalities.396 Interventional radiology with angiographic embolization \ntechniques may be useful in situations where endoscopy is not helpful.398 \nAdditionally, external beam RT (EBRT) has been shown to effectively \nmanage acute and chronic GI bleeding.399,400 Palliative gastrectomy is also \nan option in select patients.  Proton pump inhibitors can also be prescribed \nto reduce the risk of bleeding from gastric cancer; however, there are no \ndefinitive data supporting their use at this time.  \nObstruction  \nThe primary goals of palliation for patients with malignant gastric obstruction are to reduce nausea and vomiting and, when possible, allow \nresumption of an oral diet. Management of malignant gastric obstruction \nshould be individualized, and treatment opti ons should be selected as \nclinically appropriate. Treatment options used to alleviate or bypass obstruction include surgery (gastrojejunostomy\n401 or gastrectomy in select \npatients198), EBRT, chemotherapy, and endoscopic placement of an \nenteral stent for relief of gastric outlet obstruction401 or esophageal stent \nfor EGJ/cardia obstruction. Endoscopic placement of a SEMS is a safe and effective minimally invasive palliative treatment for patients with \nluminal obstruction due to advanced gastric cancer.\n402- 405 In a systematic \nreview, patients treated with endoscopic placement of a SEMS were more PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:37:40 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-42 likely to tolerate oral intake and had shorter hospital stays than patients \ntreated with gastrojejunostomy.406 The results of another systematic \nreview suggest that SEMS placement may be associated with more favorable results in patients with a relatively short life expectancy, whereas \ngastrojejunostomy is preferable in patients with a more prolonged \nprognosis.\n401 A randomized trial also reported similar findings.199 However, \nthese results need to be confirmed in larger randomized trials.  \nWhen obstruction cannot be alleviated or bypassed, the primary goal is to \nreduce the symptoms of obstruction via venting gastrostomy.407 \nPercutaneous, endoscopic, surgical, or interventional radiology gastrostomy tube placement may be performed for gastric decompression, \nif tumor location permits. Percutaneous decompressive gastrostomy has \nbeen associated with palliative benefit for patients with gastric outlet \nobstruction.\n408,409 Ascites, if present, should be drained prior to venting \ngastrostomy tube placement to reduce the risk of infectious complications.\n410,411 Feeding gastrostomy tubes for patients with \nEGJ/gastric cardia obstruction or jejunal feeding tubes for patients with mid and distal gastric obstruction may be necessary to provide adequate \nhydration and nutritional support for patients who cannot tolerate an oral \ndiet. Nutritional counseling may also be valuable.  \nPain  \nPain control may be achieved with the use of EBRT or chemotherapy. If \nthe patient is experiencing tumor -related pain, then pain should be \nassessed and treated according to the NCCN Guidelines for Adult Cancer Pain (available at  www.nccn.org\n). Severe, uncontrolled pain following \ngastric stent placement should be treated with immediate endoscopic removal of the stent.  Nausea and Vomiting  \nPatients experiencing nausea and vomiting should be treated according to the NCCN Guidelines for Antiemesis  (available at www.nccn.org\n). Nausea \nand vomiting may be associated with luminal obstruction, so endoscopic or fluoroscopic evaluation should be performed to determine if obstruction \nis present.  \nSummary  \nGastric cancer is rampant in many parts of  the world  and is often \ndiagnosed at an advanced stage . Risk factors for gastric cancer include H. \npylori  infection , smoking, and high salt intake. Some  gastric cancers are \nassociated with inherited gastric cancer predisposition syndromes . See  \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: \nColorectal, Endometrial, and Gastric  (available at www.nccn.org ) for more \ninformation. The NCCN Panel strongly recommends multidisciplinary team \nmanagement as essential for treating localized gastric cancer. Best \nsupportive care is an integral part of treatment, especially in patients with unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic  disease. \nER (EMR or ESD) is the primary treatment option for patients with early -\nstage ( Tis or T1a ) tumors. Patients who are m edically fit with resectable \nT1b or higher, any N tumors can  receive s urgery with  D2 lymph node \ndissection. Perioperative chemotherapy is a category 1 recommendation \nfor patients with resectable T2 or higher, any N tumors  or \nneoadjuvant/perioperative ICI can be considered for certain patients with \nMSI-H/dMMR tumors (category 2A) . Patients who are medically fit with \nsurgically unresectable tum ors have the option of chemoradiation or \nsystemic therapy. Nonsurgical candidates (patients who cannot tolerate \nsurgery or decline surgery) and patients with metastatic disease should \nreceive palliative management.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nGastric Cancer  \n \nMS-43 Following an R0 resection,  observation is an option for patients with Tis or \nT1,N0 tumors  who did not receive previous systemic therapy . \nPostoperative chemoradiation is recommended for patients with T3– T4, \nany N  tumors  or any T, N+  tumors  in patients who had received less than \na D2 lymph node dissection and had not received previous systemic \ntherapy  (category 1) . Selected patients with T2, N0 tumors and high-risk \nfeatures  can also be considered for postoperative chemoradiation. \nPostoperative chemotherapy should be reserved for patients with T3 –T4, \nany N and or any T, N+ tumors  who received D2 lymph node dissection \n(category 1) . Postoperative chemoradiation is recommended for all \npatients with residual disease at surgical margins  if it was not received \npreviously . Palliative management is also an option for certain patients \nfollowing R2 resection.  Options for patients who have received previous \nsystemic therapy  include systemic therapy  (category 1) following R0 \nresection.  Patients with R1 or R2 resection have the option of \nchemoradiation. Patients with R1 resection can  also be considered for re -\nresection , while patients with R2 resection can receive palliative \nmanagement. Palliative management is an option for patients with M1 \ndisease, regardless of whether they received preoperative therapy.  \nHistologic subtype and molecular characteristics have important \nimplications in diagnosing and treating gastric cancer.  The list of \nbiomarkers that will characterize more subsets will continue to evolve.  \nSeveral targeted therapeutic agents,  including HER2 -directed therapies , \nICIs, and various kinase inhibitors , have been approved by the FDA for \nadvanced gastric cancer.  Targeted therapies have produced encouraging \nresults in the treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer.  The \nNCCN Guidelines for Gastric Cancer are based on evidence-  and \nconsensus -based treatment approaches for the comprehensive care of \npatients with gastric cancer . The Panel encourages patients with gastric \ncancer to participate in well -designed clinical trials investigating novel therapeutic strategies to enable further advances  in the management of \nthis disease.
