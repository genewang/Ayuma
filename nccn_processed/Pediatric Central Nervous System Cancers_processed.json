Baseline imaging of the brain and spine, especially by MRI, is \nrecommended before treatment for high-grade gliomas. Imaging is always recommended to investigate the etiology of emergent signs and \nsymptoms.

T2 hypointensity or reduced diffusion may indicate high cellularity .5,1\n• Brain and spine MRI with and without gadolinium is the recommended imaging modality for staging and response evaluation for high-grade \nglioma. \n• Rapid sequence MRI is not a substitute for a full brain and spine MRI when staging or assessing for response evaluation for high-grade \nglioma.\n• CT is not recommended for staging and response evaluation for high-grade glioma unless in the very rare cases where MRI is not feasible.\n• Basic MRI sequences of the brain should include: T2/FLAIR, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), gradient echo (GRE) or susceptibility weighted \nimaging (SWI), T1-weighted images pre-contrast, as well as T1-weighted images in two planes post-contrast (one of which would ideally be \nacquired as a 3D sequence)6,7 (see Table 1 [PGLIO-A 3A of 4]). \n\u0017These should be utilized for initial preliminary diagnostic evaluation and immediate postoperative follow-up (ideally within 24–48 hours post-\nop, if clinically feasible) to facilitate comparison of disease burden (measurable and non-measurable disease) on initial examination and \nextent of resection on immediate postoperative scan.\n\u00172D acquisitions should be ≤4-mm slices; 3D acquisitions should be nearly isotropic. \n\u0017T1 post-contrast sequences should be obtained as either 3D T1-weighted GRE or turbo spin echo (TSE) acquisitions for planar \nreconstructions and/or volumetric analysis of tumors.\n• Basic MRI imaging of the spine should include sagittal and axial T2-weighted and post-contrast T1-weighted images of the entire neural axis. \nAdditional sequences such as high-resolution heavily T2-weighted images, 3D balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) sequence \n(CISS/FIESTA-C), and/or DWI may be helpful1,7 (see Table 2 [PGLIO-A 3B of 4])\n\u0017These should be utilized to evaluate for infiltrative disease within the spinal cord as well as leptomeningeal spread of neoplasm.\n\u0017Sagittal slices should be ≤3 mm and axial slices may be 3- to 4-mm slices.\n\u0017Preoperative spine imaging should be performed at the time of brain imaging, because many children require sedation to tolerate the \nexamination and to prevent potential confusion for blood products in the spinal canal in the postoperative setting.\n\u0017Postoperative spine MRIs should be delayed to occur at least 10 to 14 days postoperatively, if evaluating for leptomeningeal spread of \nneoplasm to avoid confusion with blood products.\n• For MRI contrast, group II gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are recommended for use given the potential of higher gadolinium \nretention with linear GBCAs.6\n• Follow-up studies of the brain and spine should be performed at intervals defined by the treatment algorithms. More frequent imaging may \nbe necessary if indicated by the treating physician in the event of clinical deterioration or evolving imaging findings that are concerning for \nrecurrent or residual disease.\n\u0017Longitudinal follow-up studies may be complemented by MR perfusion or MR spectroscopy , if those techniques are available, to assess \nresponse to therapy or to evaluate for progression, pseudoprogression, or radiation necrosis.\na Some imaging modalities or techniques may not be available at all institutions.Continued\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

Patients should subsequently undergo MRI unless \ncontraindicated or not available. In those cases, CT with contrast may be obtained to evaluate the mass, understanding it has limited \nsensitivity compared to MRI.6\n•  Benefits: Shorter acquisition time; generally no sedation is needed; ideal in acutely emergent or immediate postoperative settings; and \nsensitive to acute blood products and calcium\n•  Limitations: Ionizing radiation; limited soft tissue contrast; limited evaluation of metastatic disease; and metal causes streak artifact, which \nlimits evaluation\nMR Perfusion6,8-10: Measures cerebral blood volume and/or cerebral blood flow in neoplasms; choice of various techniques (dynamic \nsusceptibility contrast-enhanced [DSC] vs. dynamic contrast-enhanced [DCE] vs. arterial spin labeling [ASL] perfusion) will depend upon user \navailability and preference\n• May be helpful for grading neoplasms, assessing response to therapy, identifying malignant degeneration and pseudoprogression, \ndistinguishing radiation necrosis from recurrent neoplasm, and choosing biopsy site\n• Limitations: Reliability degraded by adjacent metal, blood byproducts, air, and bone/soft tissue interface; other general limitations of MRI are \nas previously listed\nMR Spectroscopy6,10,11: Assess metabolites of neoplasms (choice of single voxel vs. multivoxel spectroscopy will depend on user preference \nand availability)\n• May be helpful for grading neoplasms, assessing response to therapy, identifying malignant degeneration and pseudoprogression, \ndistinguishing radiation necrosis from recurrent neoplasm, and choosing biopsy site\n• Limitations: Complex acquisition technique and post-processing that benefits from expertise; long acquisition times; requires nonstandard \nacquisition and post-processing; reliability degraded by adjacent metal, blood byproducts, and bone/soft tissue/air interfaces\nPET Studies : Assess brain tissue metabolism with radiopharmaceuticals\n• May be useful in differentiating between neoplasm and radiation necrosis, tumor grading, or identifying more aggressive focus for biopsy\n• Limitations: Limited spatial resolution compared to brain CT and MRI; heterogenous availability of radioisotopes; and additional radiation \nexposure\nSupplemental Imaging for Preoperative Planning :\n• Isotropic volumetric MRI to accurately localize the neoplasms by coregistering the data with intraoperative guidance software; often \ncomplemented with isotropic CT studies to improve localization6\n• Functional MRI studies can be used to depict spatial relationships between eloquent cortex (eg, regions of the brain primarily responsible for \nspeech, vision, and motor and sensory function) and the neoplasms to serve as a road map and promote safe resections6\n• Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with tractography may also be used to localize major white matter tracts underlying the eloquent cortex that \ncould also comprom ise vital functions if injured during surgery6\nReferencesContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

A general workflow for processing of tissue and tumor \ncharacterization using histologic, immunohistochemical (IHC), and molecular data is presented. However, this is not meant to serve as an \nexhaustive algorithm for diagnosis and classification of the multitude of subtypes of pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas that have presently \nbeen described.\nStandard Histopathologic Examination and Classification\nHistologic and IHC examination of the tumor should be performed. Care should be taken to conserve tissue, and IHC studies for molecular \nmarkers may be skipped in lieu of submitting tissue directly for molecular studies in cases where the specimen is scant. Commonly used IHC \nmarkers for molecular alterations, and broad indications for using them, are presented below. Molecular alterations demonstrated by IHC may \nrequire confirmation by molecular methods ( Molecular Characterization [PGLIO-B 2 of 4] ).\nCommonly Used IHC Markers for High-Grade Glial Tumors\n• BRAF V600E (particularly if epithelioid or piloid histology): Potentially therapeutically actionable\n• H3 K27me3 (particularly for midline, diffuse glial tumors1): Loss (negativity) is diagnostic of diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered, WHO \ngrade 4, with fulfillment of appropriate histologic parameters, particularly with a supportive molecular profile. Should be used in conjunction \nwith H3 K27M, in which positivity is also diagnostic of this entity in the appropriate context\n• INI1 (SMARCB1 ) rhabdoid morphology\n• IDH1 R132H (particularly for adolescent and young adult [AYA] patients): Positivity is diagnostic of an IDH-mutant diffuse glioma including \noligodendroglioma; IDH-mutant and 1p/19q codeleted; and astrocytoma, IDH-mutant. These tumors are considered to be adult-type diffuse \ngliomas and are beyond the scope of these guidelines. Please refer to the adult NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers .\nLimited Tissue Sample/Specimen\n• When tissue is limited, recommend obtaining the following if possible:\n\u0017Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology\n\u0017Limited IHC panel\n\u0017Next-generation sequencing (NGS)\n\u0017Methylation profiling\n• Limited IHC panels should only employ stains that would provide essential diagnostic information; in cases of particularly limited tissue, \nstains for mutations (such as IDH1 R132H or BRAF V600E) already covered by NGS can also be omitted if redundant.\nPGLIO-B \n1 OF 4Continued\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

In adults, molecular workup has remained \nrelatively simple, with focus on distinguishing IDH-mutant from IDH-wild-type gliomas. However, in the majority of pediatric tumors, there \nexists a high degree of histologic overlap and non-specificity of histologic features amongst the numerous recognized pathologic entities, \nand underlying molecular alterations in pediatric gliomas are distinct from those seen in adults. This underscores the immense importance \nof molecular testing in pediatric tumor diagnostics.\n\u0017Molecular testing in many cases is critical to diagnosis, distinguishing high-grade tumors from lower grade counterparts, and uncovering \nalterations that have been demonstrated to be prognostically relevant2-7 (Table 1 PGLIO-B 3 of 4 ). \n\u0017While targeted therapies are still limited, clinical trial stratification is becoming increasingly dependent on molecular characterization. \n• In light of the number of genes of interest, in conjunction with the many types of recurrent alterations (including point mutations, insertion/\ndeletions, copy number variations, and fusions), broad molecular testing is required for comprehensive classification of pediatric diffuse \nhigh-grade gliomas:\n\u0017Copy number and fusion detection:\n ◊NGS with fusion detection (ie, ROS1, MET, NTRK1/2/3, ALK, FGFR1/2/3)\n ◊RNA sequencing \n ◊High-resolution copy number array\n\u0017DNA methylation-based analysis may offer objective, more precise tumor classification; however, it should not be used as a first-line \nmolecular test\n• In the pediatric population, dedicated germline testing should be strongly considered in the appropriate clinical context, recognizing that not \nall sequencing assays readily distinguish between germline and somatic variants.8,9\nPGLIO-B \n2 OF 4Continued\nReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

Treatment decision planning should include radiation oncology, neurosurgery, radiology, and oncology/neuro-oncology.\n• Consider physical therapy/occupational therapy and sleep and swallow assessments to assist with comorbidity management.\n• Consider referral to a child life social worker for family/patient support.\nPostoperative Management\n• Monitor for signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.\n• Consider the following: \n\u0017Seizure prophylaxis2\n\u0017Antibiotics for infection prophylaxis \n\u0017Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxisSurgical Procedure\n• Alleviate symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure or tumor mass effect, increase survival, and decrease corticosteroid dose \nrequirements.\n• Obtain adequate and optimal tissue for a pathologic diagnosis and molecular genetic characterization. \n• In pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas, a meta-analysis has demonstrated an association between greater extent of resection and improved \noverall survival.1\n• Nearly all diffuse high-grade gliomas recur. Re-resection at the time of recurrence may improve outcomes.

CT simulation for treatment planning should include ≤0.25 cm slice thickness. \nVolumetric CT simulation for treatment planning is recommended. \n\u0017Image-guided RT (IGRT) may be used to ensure daily setup accuracy.\n\u0017Tumor volumes are best defined using pre- and postoperative MRI imaging using both post-contrast T1 volumetric and T2/FLAIR \nsequences to define gross tumor volume (GTV). Obtain RT treatment planning MRI to account for any postoperative evolution of tumor and/\nor surgical changes. Volumetric T2/FLAIR and DTI (for white matter tracts) are optional but can be helpful sequences to define GTV.\n\u0017GTV1 includes the enhancing and non-enhancing areas of tumor both pre- and post-resection. GTV1 should take into account changes in \nbrain anatomy post-resection and surgical tracts for deep tumors may be excluded if not involved pre-surgery. \n\u0017GTV2 will include residual tumor post-resection. It will typically include the resection bed. For no residual tumor GTV1 = GTV2. \n\u0017Clinical target volume (CTV) 1 is an isotropic 1- to 2-cm expansion of GTV1, with the larger margins along white matter tracts.\n\u0017CTV2 is an isotropic expansion of 0.5–1 cm on GTV2. \n\u0017PTV1/2 is an isotropic expansion that is institution-specific, but typically 3–5 mm, and dependent on frequency and modality of imaging, \nand size of the targets.

The mass characteristically demonstrates reduced diffusion due to high cellularity . Most cases demonstrate \nheterogeneous cyst formation or necrosis, with heterogeneous and variable enhancement. In the spine, medulloblastoma can demonstrate \nleptomeningeal dissemination.5,6\n• Brain and spine MRI with and without gadolinium is the recommended imaging modality for initial staging and response evaluation for \nmedulloblastoma. \n• Rapid sequence MRI is not a substitute for a full brain and spine MRI when staging or assessing for response evaluation for \nmedulloblastoma.\n• CT is not recommended for staging and response evaluation for medulloblastoma unless in the very rare cases where MRI is not feasible.\n• Basic MRI sequences of the brain should include: T2/FLAIR, DWI, GRE or SWI, T1-weighted images pre-contrast, as well as T1-weighted \nimages in two planes post-contrast (one of which would ideally be acquired as a 3D sequence)7,8 (see Table 1 [PGLIO-3A of 4]).\n\u0017These should be utilized for initial preliminary diagnostic evaluation and immediate postoperative follow-up (ideally within 24–48 hours \npost-op, if clinically feasible) to facilitate comparison of disease burden (measurable and non-measurable disease) on initial examination \nand extent of resection on the immediate postoperative scan.\n\u00172D acquisitions should be ≤4-mm slices; 3D acquisitions should be nearly isotropic. \n\u0017T1 post-contrast sequences should be obtained as either 3D T1-weighted GRE or TSE acquisitions for planar reconstructions and/or \nvolumetric analysis of tumors.\n• Basic MRI imaging of the spine is designed to evaluate for leptomeningeal disease and should include sagittal T2-W images, and post-\ncontrast sagittal and axial T1-weighted images of the entire spine. Additional sequences such as high-resolution heavily T2-weighted \nimages, 3D bSSFP sequence (CISS/FIESTA-C), and/or DWI may be helpful and should also be obtained when feasible8 (see Table 2 [PGLIO-\n3B of 4])\n\u0017These sequences should be utilized to evaluate for leptomeningeal spread of neoplasm.\n\u0017Sagittal slices should be ≤3 mm and axial slices may be 3- to 4-mm slices in thickness.\n\u0017Preoperative spine imaging should be performed at the time of brain imaging, because many children require sedation to tolerate the \nexamination and to prevent potential confusion for blood products in the spinal canal in the postoperative setting.\n\u0017Postoperative spine MRIs should be delayed to occur at least 10–14 days postoperatively, if evaluating for leptomeningeal spread of \nneoplasm to avoid confusion with blood products.\n• For MRI contrast, Group II GBCAs are recommended for use given the potential of higher gadolinium retention with linear GBCAs.7\n• Follow-up studies of the brain and spine should be performed at intervals defined by the treatment algorithms. More frequent imaging may \nbe necessary if indicated by the treating physician in the event of clinical deterioration or evolving imaging findings that are concerning for \nrecurrent or residual disease.\n\u0017Longitudinal follow-up studies may be complemented by MR perfusion or MR spectroscopy , if those techniques are available, to assess \nresponse to therapy or to evaluate for progression, pseudoprogression, or radiation necrosis.PRINCIPLES OF NEUROIMAGINGa\nPMB-A\n2 OF 4a Some imaging modalities or techniques may not be available at all institutions.

Patients should subsequently undergo MRI unless contraindicated or not available.  \nIn those cases, CT with contrast may be obtained to evaluate the mass, understanding it has limited sensitivity compared to MRI.7\n•  Benefits: Shorter acquisition time; generally no sedation is needed; ideal in acutely emergent or immediate postoperative settings; and sensitive to acute \nblood products and calcium.\n•  Limitations: Ionizing radiation; limited soft tissue contrast; limited evaluation of metastatic disease, and metal causes streak artifact, which limits \nevaluation.\nMR Perfusion:7,9-11 Measures cerebral blood volume and/or cerebral blood flow in neoplasms; choice of various techniques (DSC vs. DCE vs. ASL perfusion) \nwill depend upon user availability and preference.\n• May be helpful for grading neoplasms, assessing response to therapy, identifying malignant degeneration and pseudoprogression, distinguishing radiation \nnecrosis from recurrent neoplasm, and choosing biopsy site.\n• Limitations: Reliability degraded by adjacent metal, blood products, air, and bone/soft tissue interface; poor signal to noise (ASL imaging) and other \ngeneral limitations of MRI are as previously listed. \nMR Spectroscopy:7,11,12 Assess metabolites of neoplasms (choice of single voxel vs. multivoxel spectroscopy will depend on user preference and \navailability).\n• May be helpful for grading neoplasms, assessing response to therapy, identifying malignant degeneration and pseudoprogression, distinguishing radiation \nnecrosis from recurrent neoplasm, and choosing biopsy site.\n• Limitations: Complex acquisition technique and post-processing that benefits from expertise; long acquisition times; and reliability degraded by adjacent \nmetal, blood products, and bone/soft tissue/air interfaces.\nPET Studies : Assess brain tissue metabolism with radiopharmaceuticals.\n• May be useful in differentiating between neoplasm and radiation necrosis, tumor grading, or identifying more aggressive focus for biopsy . In some studies, \nintensity of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET uptake has been correlated with prognosis and survival in medulloblastoma.13,14\n• Limitations: Limited spatial resolution compared to brain CT and MRI; heterogenous availability of radioisotopes; and additional radiation exposure.\nSupplemental Imaging for Preoperative Planning :\n• Isotropic volumetric MRI to accurately localize the neoplasms by coregistering the data with intraoperative guidance software. It is often complemented \nwith isotropic CT studies to improve localization.7\n•  Functional MRI studies can be used to depict spatial relationships between eloquent cortex (eg, regions of the brain primarily responsible for speech, \nvision, and motor and sensory function) and the neoplasms to serve as a road map and promote safe resections.7\n• DTI with tractography may also be used to localize major white matter tracts underlying the eloquent cortex that could also compromise vital functions if \ninjured during surgery.7\n• Different deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for imaging that assist in identifying different pediatric medulloblastoma types are still at \nan early stage. There is a possibility of enhancing the classification of medulloblastoma subtypes by merging data from textured images and the original \nhistopathologic images. This evaluation that combines radiology and genomics could become significant in the future.15PRINCIPLES OF NEUROIMAGINGa\na Some imaging modalities or techniques may not be available at all institutions.\nPMB-A\n3 OF 4ReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

However , \nmorphologic patterns with clinicopathologic utility remain critical to recognize as they correlate well with molecular subtypes and may \ntherefore predict molecular group(s) before molecular data are available, as well as support molecular characterization. To this end, IHC \nanalysis is also of great utility, especially as these stains provide rapid screening for specific genetic alterations (eg, beta-catenin, p53, INI1/\nSMARCB1 ). Integration of morphologic, IHC, and molecular data is always required.\n• Currently, five medulloblastoma molecular groups are recognized (2021 CNS WHO Classification, 5th edition):\n\u0017WNT-activated\n\u0017SHH-activated, TP53-wild-type \n\u0017SHH-activated, TP53-mutant \n\u0017Group 3\n\u0017Group 4\n• Group 3 and Group 4 have been combined and collectively referred to as “non-WNT/non-SHH medulloblastomas.” DNA  methylation profiling \nsupports the existence of eight robust non-WNT/non-SHH subgroups; among these are high-risk DNA methylation patterns associated with a \npoor prognosis.\n• Exceptional cases of medulloblastomas that do not classify precisely with a known group based on molecular profiling may receive a \ndiagnosis of \"medulloblastoma, not elsewhere classified (NEC).\" Examples include medulloblastomas with both WNT -activating and SHH-\nactivating mutations that do not match well with a known methylation profile, medulloblastomas without driver mutations characteristic of a \ngroup that do not match a known methylation profile, and others. Though the expected prognoses of such tumors may be unclear , histology \nand molecular markers, including presence or absence of those associated with more aggressive behavior, may be suggestive.\n• Per the 2021 CNS WHO Classification (5th edition), DNA methylation profiling is recommended for determining medulloblastoma group or \nsubgroup statusa; however, the findings should always be interpreted in conjunction with genetic profiling ( TP53 mutation, MYC/MYCN \namplification, and germline testing for cancer predisposition syndromes), as well as histologic and IHC parameters. IHC for beta-catenin may \nbe particularly helpful to demonstrate WNT-pathway activation in patients with low-risk, WNT-activated medulloblastoma.\n• Timely molecular testing is important for diagnosis.\n• Germline testing and genetic counseling is recommended.\na Additional methods used for assigning molecular group include IHC, RNA-based gene expression profiling, and additional methylation-based analyses among others.\nPMB-B \n1 OF 3ContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

Even when viewed by molecular subtype, GTR and NTR (≤1.5 cm2 residual) produce roughly \nequivalent overall survival. \n• Surgical management of obstructive hydrocephalus must be considered alongside relief of local mass effect and diagnostic considerations. \nAdjuvant treatment initiation should not be delayed, once surgical wound healing, hydrocephalus, and brainstem/cranial nerve dysfunction \naffecting airway protection are adequately addressed. Early physical therapy , occupational therapy, and speech therapy intervention are \nrecommended for cases of posterior fossa syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, or brainstem dysfunction. \nPreoperative Assessment\n• Treat emergent situations prior to further investigative studies or interventions.\n• Provide medical management to temporarily relieve local mass effect (ie, corticosteroids), focal neurologic deficits, or seizure (ie, anti-\nepileptics).\n• Avoid medications that may alter the patient's neurologic examination (eg, narcotics) or increase surgical risks (eg, anticoagulants).\n• Patients should undergo gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the full neural axis, preferably before surgery.\nSurgical Procedure\n• Alleviate symptoms related to local mass effect to increase survival.\n• Obtain adequate tissue for histopathologic diagnosis and molecular genetic characterization.\n• The goal of extent-of-resection should be GTR or at least NTR (≤1.5 cm2 residual), if feasible in the context of minimizing postoperative \nneurologic deficits.\n• Second-look surgery is recommended for patients with resectable residual disease.\n• Re-resection at the time of recurrence may confer overall survival benefit in the setting of a single, focal posterior fossa recurrence. \n• Biopsy of recurrent disease may identify actionable molecular findings, or rarely , a secondary malignancy.\nPostoperative Management\n• Monitor for signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Either ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt or endoscopic third \nventriculostomy (ETV) are acceptable CSF diversion techniques.8\n• Lumbar puncture for CSF studies should be done ≥10 days postoperatively and before adjuvant treatment.\n• Early consultation with radiation oncology and neurooncology is recommended.\n• Early physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy intervention are recommended in cases of posterior fossa syndrome, \ncerebellar ataxia, or brainstem dysfunction.\n• Consider referral to a child life social worker for family/patient support.PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY1-7\nPMB-C\n1 OF 2ReferencesPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

Although \npediatric tumors are rare, accounting for only 1% of all cancer  diagnoses  \n(adult and pediatric) , they are  the leading cause of disease -related death \nin children.  CNS  cancers  are the second most common malignancy in \nchildren after leukemia  and lymphoma combined .1 They  account for 26% \nof all pediatric tumors  and are the leading cause of cancer -related death in \nchildren .2 More than 4000 brain and spinal cord tumors are diagnosed \neach year in children and teens , and t he incidence rate has remained \nsteady  in recent years.1 According to the Central Brain Tumor Registry of \nthe United States (CBTRUS) Statistical Report , the incidence rate of \nprimary CNS tumors i n children <20 years was  6.23 per 100,000  \npopulation between 2014 and 201 8.3 The most common malignant \npediatric CNS tumors are gliomas  and embryonal tumors , the latter  \nconsisting predominately of medulloblastomas.3   \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the publication  of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in \nOncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Pediatric Central Nervous System \nCancers, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to \nobtain key literature in the field of neuro -oncology  published since the \nprevious Guidelines update , using the  following  search terms : pediatric \ndiffuse high-grade glioma  and pediatric medulloblastoma . The PubMed \ndatabase was chosen because it remains the most widely used resource \nfor medical literature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.4  The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial; Clinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, \nPhase IV; Practice Guideline; Guidelines; Randomized Controlled Trial; \nMeta -Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  The data \nfrom key PubMed articles and articles from additional sources deemed as \nrelevant to these Guidelines have been included in this version of the \nDiscussion section. Recommendations for which high -level evidence is \nlacking are based on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and \nexpert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.5 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person -first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  NCCN \nGuidelines incorporate non -gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan -specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women , female , and male  when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not diffe rentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to colle ct more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-3 Tumor Types  \nThe NCCN Guidelines® for Pediatric Central Nervous System Cancers \nfocus on the comprehensive care  of pediatric  patients with malignant \ndiseases of the CNS . These guidelines will be  updated annually to include \nnew information or treatment philosophies as they become available. \nHowever, because this field continually evolves, practitioners should use \nall available information to determine the best clinical options for their \npatients.  The updated version of the Guidelines addresses  diffuse high -\ngrade glioma s and medulloblastoma in children and adolescents .  \nPrinciples of Management  \nSeveral important principles guide surgical management and treatment \nwith radiation therapy ( RT) and systemic therapy for children with CNS \ntumors, including tumor histology, patient age and performance status, \nlocation of the tumor in the brain, resectability of the tumor, and prior \nmanagement. All patients with pediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas  and \nmedulloblastomas  should be cared for  by a multidisciplinary team with \nexperience managing CNS tumors. The involvement of pediatric \noncologists /neuro -oncologists, pediatric radiation oncologists, pathologists \nwith expertise in neuropathology a nd molecular pathology, pediatric \nneuroradiologists , and pediatric neurosurgeons is strongly encouraged . \nPathologic  diagnosis is critical and may be difficult to accurately determine \nwithout sufficient tumor tissue. Review of the tumor tissue by an \nexperienced neuropathologist is highly recommended. The i nformation \ncontained in the algorithms and principles of management sections are \ndesigned to help clinicians navigate the complex management of CNS \ntumors in pediatric patients.  \nWHO Classification of Pediatric CNS Tumors  \nDue to the unique nature of childhood tumors made clear by  \nadvancements in molecular analyses, pediatric tumors are now covered in separate sections of the published fifth edition of the World Health \nOrganization ( WHO ) Classification  of Tumors  of the Central Nervous \nSystem (WHO CNS5)  as well as in the inaugural WHO C lassification  of \nPediatric Tumors .6,7 These volumes reflect  fundamental paradigm shifts \naffecting  pediatric  CNS tumor classification , including the use of a layered,  \nintegrated , diagnostic approach involving  both histologic  and molecular \nanalyses ; the inclusion of novel , molecularly  defined tumor  entities ; the \nadaptation of  tumor grading as a measure for differential aggressiveness \nwithin a tumor type rather than between tumor types ; and the widespread \nintroduction of novel molecular diagnostic  tools for tumor classification . \nPediatric Diffuse High -Grade Gliomas  \nIn WHO CNS5, gliomas  are divided into di stinct  categories: adult-type \ndiffuse gliomas (the majority of primary brain tumors in adults), p ediatric -\ntype diffuse low -grade gliomas (expected to have good prognoses), and \npediatric -type diffuse high -grade gliomas (expected to have poor \nprognosis ); circumscribed astrocytic gliomas (referring to their more \nconcentrated growth pattern) ; glioneuronal and neuronal tumors ; and \nependymomas .6  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Pediatric Central Nervous System  Cancers \ncurrently include recommendations for the management of the four types \nof pediatric -type diffuse high -grade gliomas  recognized in WHO CNS56 \nand refer to children and adolescents ≤21 years of age : \n• Diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34-mutant  \n• Diffuse pediatric -type high -grade glioma, H3 wild-type and IDH \nwild-type  \n• Infant -type hemispheric glioma  \n• Diffuse midline glioma  (DMG) , H3 K27-altered  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-4 The first three are newly recognized  tumor entities.  Diffuse hemispheric \nglioma, H3 G34-mutant is a malignant, infiltrative glioma of the cerebral \nhemispheres with a missense  mutation in the H3F3A gene that results in a \nG34R/V substitution of histone H3. Diffuse pediatric -type high -grade \nglioma, H3 wild-type and IDH wild-type represents a  mixture of  distinct  \nmolecular subtypes specified as being wild -type for both H3 and IDH gene \nfamilies.  Infant -type hemispheric glioma is a novel tumor type typically \noccurring  in newborns and very young children and is associated with \nfusion genes involving ALK, ROS1 , NTRK1/2/3 , or MET.  While not a new \nentity , the nomenclature was changed from  DMG , H3 K27-mutant to \nDMG , H3 K27-altered in order  to include subtypes with a different \nmechanism for the loss of H3 K27 trimethylation (eg, EZHIP protein \noverexpression) .6,7 These guidelines do not include recommendations for \nprimary spinal cord tumors.  \n \nIntroduction  \nEpidemiology  \nPediatric diffuse high-grade glioma  represents approximately 9.3% of all \nprimary malignant and non-malignant brain and other CNS  tumors  \ndiagnosed in children and adolescents ≤19 years .3 Although i ncidence \nrates generally decrease with age from 0  to 19 years , the rate of high-\ngrade glioma in the brain-stem, specifically,  is highest  for age groups 5 to \n9 years ( 0.56 per 100,000 population).3 The prognosis  for aggressive \ndiffuse high -grade gliomas  is general ly poor with 5 -year survival rates of \n<20% despite the use of combined modality therap ies of surgery, RT , and \nsystemic therapy .8 Prognosis and survival rates for diffuse high -grade \ngliomas  depend  on multiple factors including the  age at presentation , \ntumor location, sex, extent of resection, histologic  subtype , and genomic \nprofile .9 While diagnosis is more common in females, males typically have \nhigher mortality rates from CNS tumors .10 Risk Factors  \nAlthough the cause of most  pediatric  CNS  tumors  is unknown, several \ngenetic and environmental factors have been linked to  an increase d risk of \nprimary brain tumor development in children . Certain i nherited cancer \npredispositio n syndromes , including neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1), Li -\nFraumeni syndrome, and Turcot syndrome/Lynch syndrome/ constitutional \nmismatch repair deficiency ( CMMRD) , are associated with increased \nsusceptibility to  pediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas .11-14 Exposure to high-\ndose ionizing  radiation has also been linked to pediatric brain \nmalignancies .11,15,16 Ionizing radiation has more carcinogenic potential in \nchildren because they are more radiosensitive than adults and have more \npotential years of life to express the risk.16 Estimated risk is higher for \nyounger children, and the predicted latency between radiation exposure \nand brain tumor  development  is 7 to 9 years , with meningiomas and \ngliomas being the most common  radiation -induced tumor types .9-11,16  \nClinical Presentation  \nPresentation and symptoms depend largely on tumor location and \npatient age at the time of diagnosis.17 The m ost common symptoms \ninclude effects of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache s \nthat worse n over time , nausea , vomiting , and blurred vision . These may \nbe caused by growth of the tumor, swelling in the brain, or blocked flow \nof cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF) .1 Other presenting symptoms include \nseizure, hemiparesis, monoparesis, cranial nerve deficits, ataxia, \nhemisensory loss, dysphasia, aphasia , and memory impairment . \nPresenting symptoms among infants include i ncreasing head \ncircumference and loss of developmental milestones.  School -age \nchildren may experience poor school performance, fatigue , and \npersonality changes. Symptoms may occur gradually and worse n over \ntime, or occur  suddenly, such as with a seizur e.1  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-5 Treatment Overview  \nTreatment for pediatric diffuse high -grade glioma  depends on many \nfactors such as the type of tumor, its location and size, how far it has \nspread , and the age and overall health of the patient.1 The main treatment \nparadigm includes  surgery  followed by  systemic therapy with or without \nRT. The g oals of surgery include the safe reduction of tumor -associated \nmass effect and obtaining adequate tissue for histologic and molecular  \nclassification.  The location and size of the tumor  and the general \ncondition of the patient  are important determinants of surgical \noutcome .9,11,18,19 Crani al radiation  may result in developmental \nimpairments in young children ; therefore , it is reasonable to defer or omit \nRT in  children <3 years.9 Despite surgery and adjuvant therapy,  pediatric \ndiffuse high -grade gliomas  typically have a poor prognosis.  Referral for \ncancer predisposition evaluation and/or genetic counseling should be \nconsidered.  \nPrinciples of Neuroi maging  \nConventional MRI is recommended  for tumor diagnosis, surgical \nguidance, and therapeutic monitoring. It may be complemented by \nadvanced neuroimaging techniques such as MR perfusion imaging, MR \nspectroscopy, and PET to enhance diagnostic capability, differentiate \nradiation necrosis from a ctive neoplasm, and guide biopsy. Some \nimaging modalities or techniques may not be available at all institutions. \nImaging is always recommended to investigate the etiology of emergent \nsigns and symptoms.  Below is a list of im aging modalities used in neuro -\noncology to make treatment decisions.  \nMRI of the Brain and/or Spine  \nConventional MRI of the entire neural axis (with and without intravenous \n[IV] contrast ) is the imaging modality  of choice  for the evaluation of \npediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas.20 MRI offers  excellent soft tissue \ncontrast and depiction of neoplasms through a combination of standard, universally available pulse sequences . An addition al benefit of MRI is  \nthat there is no exposure of the patient to ionizing radiation . Pediatric \ndiffuse high -grade gliomas  typically show a n infiltrative growth pattern  \nand present as large, heterogeneous, poorly differentiated , intracranial \nmasses with indistinct borders occupying most of one hemisphere.9 They  \nmay demonstrate mass effect  on surrounding structures , hemorrhage, \nincreased perfusion, vasogenic edema , and a variable degree of contrast \nenhancement.20 Higher grade components commonly enhance and \ndemonstrate restricted diffusion , which  is a key feature that reflects the \nhigh-grade  nature of the tumor .9 Rarely, high -grade pediatric gliomas \nmay be well -circumscribed without  the above -mentioned imaging \nfeatures; hence, tissue biopsy is always recommended when possible . \nLimitations  of MRI include the relatively long examination  time, \nrequirement of deep sedation/anesthesia for  younger children , metal \nfrom surgery and implants caus ing artifact s, and unsafe nature of some \nimplants in the MRI environment .  \nCompared  to gray matter, pediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas  may \ndemonstrate iso - to hypointense T1 signal and hyperintense T2 signal \nwith surrounding edema, which is apparent on fluid -attenuat ed inversion \nrecovery (FLAIR) images. Different signal characteristics can be seen  in \nthe case of tumor hemorrhage , such as T1 hyperintense, T2 \nhypointense, and low signal on susceptibility -weighted \nimaging.20 Therefore, basic MRI sequences of the brain should include \nT1-weighted images before contrast ; T1-weighted images in two planes \nafter contrast (one of which would ideally be acquired as a three -\ndimensional [ 3D] sequence) ; T2-weighted, T2 -FLAIR, and diffusion -\nweighted imaging (DWI) ; and gradient echo or susceptibility -weighted \n(blood -sensitive) imaging.  T2 hypointensity or reduced diffusion may \nindicate high cellularity.21 These images should be utilized for preliminary \ndiagnostic evaluation and immediate postoperative follow -up (ideally \nwithin 24 –48 hours after surgery , if clinically feasible) to evaluate disease PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-6 burden (measurable and non -measurable disease) on initial exam ination  \nand extent of resection on immediate postoperative scan.21-24 \nBasic MRI imaging of the spine should include post -contrast sagittal and \naxial T1 -weighted images of the entire neural axis; additional sequences \nsuch as heavily T2 -weighted images and/or DWI may be considered . \nThese images should be utilized to evaluate for leptomeningeal \nmetastasis. Preoperative spine imaging should be performed at the time \nof brain imaging since many children require sedation to tolerate the \nexam ination . Baseline imaging of the brain and spine, especially by MRI, \nis recommended before tr eatment for high -grade gliomas.   \nFollow -up studies of the brain and spine should be performed at intervals \ndefined by the treatment algorithms. More frequent imaging may be \nnecessary in the event of clinical deterioration or evolving imaging \nfindings concerning  recurrent or residual disease. Longitudinal follow -up \nstudies may be complemented by MR perfusion or MR spectroscopy to \nassess response to therapy or to evaluate for progression, pseudo -\nprogression, or radiation necrosis.  Postoperative spine MRI evaluating \nfor leptomeningeal spread of neoplasm should be delayed 2  to 3 weeks \nto avoid confusion with blood byproducts.  \nMR Perfusion  \nMR perfusion refers to a group of techniques that measure cerebral \nblood volume  (CBV)  and/or cerebral blood flow (CBF) in neoplasms . \nThese techniques m ay be useful for grading, response assessment, \nidentifying malignant degeneration and pseudo -progression, \ndistinguishing radiation necrosis from recurrent neoplasm, and choosing \nbiopsy site.25-27 Limitations of MR perfusion include the degradation of \nreliability by adjacent metal, blood byproducts, air, and bone/soft tissue \ninterface; and other general limitations of MRI as listed above.  Generally , \nmost high-grade gliomas  show higher perfusion (increased CBV and/or \nCBF) than low -grade gliomas .20,28 Various  MR perfusion  techniques include dynamic susceptibility contrast -\nenhanced [DSC], dynamic contrast -enhanced [DCE], and arterial spin \nlabeling [ASL] perfusion. The choice among these will depend upon user \navailability and preference.  DSC perfusion is the most commonly used  \ntechnique . Due to the need for power injectors and large -bore IV access, \nDSC  is challenging to perform on infants but is feasible in young \nchildren.20 Other l imitations  include calcification and hemorrhage -induced \nsusceptibility within the tumor and contrast leakage due to breakdown of \nthe blood -brain barrier .20 DCE can be used as an alternative or \ncomplementary technique to DSC , although few studies have assessed \nits use in children.29,30 The advantages of DCE over DSC are fewer \nartifacts , multiparametric characterization of tumor microvasculature , and \nthe quantification of leakage to assess blood -brain barrier integrity31; \nhowever,  DSC typically offers better blood volume estimation  than \nDCE .32  \nASL perfusion , which  uses magnetically labeled water as contrast , has \nbeen shown to be effective in  grading  and choosing biopsy site  in \nchildren  with brain tumors .33-35 ASL lacks contrast injection and high -flow \ninjections making it advantageous for pediatric use . Other advantages \ninclude easier potential for CBF quantification, better image quality in \nyounger children due to their immature sinus cavities, and the ability to \nrepeat the test if the patient moves.20,36 Limitations of ASL perfusion \ninclude a low signal -to-noise ratio , the need for greater magnetic field \nstrength , and the fact that assessment is limited to CBF .37  \nMR Spectroscopy  \nMR spectroscopy is used to a ssess the metabolites of tissues including \nneoplasms and may be useful for grading, response assessment, \nidentifying malignant degeneration and pseudo -progression, \ndistinguishing radiation necrosis from recurrent neoplasm, and choosing \nbiopsy site.20,27,38 The choice between  single voxel and multivoxel \nspectroscopy will depend on user preference and availability .

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-7 limitations  of MR spectroscopy include the degradation of reliability by \nadjacent metal, blood byproducts, and bone/soft tissue/air interfaces; \nlong and  complex acquisition s; expertise in technique/post -processing ; \nnonstandard acquisition s; nonstandard post -processing ; and post -\nprocessing  time.  \nA systematic review and meta -analysis comprising 455 patients across \n18 studies showed that MR spectroscopy alone only has moderate \ndiagnostic ability to differentiate glioma recurrence from radiation \nnecrosis, and should therefore be combined with other techniques for \nthis purpose.38 Another systematic review and meta -analysis comparing \nthe diagnostic accuracy of advanced MRI techniques to conventional \nMRI found that MR spectroscopy had the highest diagnostic accuracy for \ntreatment response evaluation in  patients with high -grade glioma, \nsupporting its use for this purpose .27  \nCT of the Brain  \nMRI scans are used more often than CT scans for brain and spine \nimaging because they are more detailed and do not use radiation. \nHowever, there are some circumstances in which CT scan provides \nadvantages over MRI. CT offers higher sensitivity to dystrophic \ncalcification in neoplasms. It also provides  greater detail of bone \nstructures  and therefore might show the effects of tumors on the skull.1 \nCT also has a shorter acquisition time and sedation is generally not \nneeded.  Limitations of CT include limited soft tissue contrast; limited \nevaluation of metastatic disease ; and metal -caused streak artifacts.   \nOn CT, pediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas typically present as \nheterogeneous lesions with mass effect,  poorly defined margin s, and \nvariable areas of hyperattenuation, which may reflect  hemorrhage , \nnecrosis , or surrounding edema. Contrast -enhanced CT features are \nvariable .20 CT of the brain (with out contrast or with and without contrast) is ideal for \nrapid assessment in the acute or immediate postoperative setting and for \nthe evaluation of acute intracranial hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly, and \nshunt -related issues. CT is recommended  when MRI is not available  or \nin patients in whom an MRI is contraindicated because of unsafe \nimplants or foreign bodies.  However, CT is not recommended for staging \nand response evaluation for high -grade glioma unless in the very rare \ncases where MRI i s not feasible.  \nBrain PET Studies  \nBrain PET studies a ssess brain tissue metabolism using a \nradiopharmaceutical , usually the glucose metabolism tracer \nfluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ). PET is typically combined with anatomical \nimaging and m ay be useful in differentiating between neoplasm and \nradiation necrosis, tumor grading, or identifying more aggressive focus \nfor biopsy . Since PET scan image s are  not as detailed as CT or MRI, it is \nused mostly as a complementary test to provide information about \nwhether abnormal areas seen on other imaging tests are likely to be \ntumors.39 PET is more likely to be helpful for identifying high -grade \ntumors than low -grade tumors.39 Additional limitations of PET include \navailability of radioisotopes and radiation exposure  to the patient.   \nSupplemental Imaging for Preoperative Planning  \nIsotropic volumetric MRI may be used for preoperative planning to \naccurately localize neoplasms by co -registering the data with \nintraoperative guidance software . This technique is often complemented \nwith isotropic CT studies to improve localization . Functional MRI studies \ncan be used to depict spatial relationships between eloquent cortex (eg, \nregions of the brain primarily responsible for  speech, vision, and motor \nand sensory function) and the neoplasms to serve as a road map and \npromote safe resections . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with \ntractography may also be used to localize major white matter tracts PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-8 underlying the eloquent cortex that could also  compromise vital functions \nif injured during surgery . \nPrinciples of Neurop athology   \nThere are fundamental  molecular differences between  pediatric and \nadult CNS tumors,  most recently recognized  in WHO  CNS5.6,7,20 In \ncontrast to tumors in adults, t umors in children typically carry a much \nlower burden of genetic aberrations  (except for hypermutant tumors) , \nand are often driven by a single genetic driver event, such as a point \nmutation or translocation leading to an oncogenic fusion.6,7 The NCCN \nGuidelines  describe guiding principles for the diagnosis of pediatric CNS \ntumor s according to the parameters of WHO CNS5 .6,7 A general \nworkflow for processing of tissue and tumor characterization using \nhistologic, immunohistochemical (IHC), and molecular data is covered in  \nthe algorithm. However, this is not meant to serve as an exhaustive \nalgorithm for diagnosis and classification of the multitude of subtypes of \npediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas that have presently been described.  \nStandard Histopathologic Examination and Classification  \nIntegrated histopathologic and molecular characterization of gliomas per \nWHO CNS5 should be standard practice.6 Molecular  and genetic \ncharacterization complements standard histo patho logic analysis, \nproviding additional diagnostic and prognostic information that improves \ndiagnostic accuracy and aids in treatment and clinical trial selection.  \nTherefore, histologic and IHC examination should be performed  on all \ntumors . Care should be taken to conserve tissue, and IHC studies for \nmolecular markers may be skipped in lieu of submitting tissue directly for \nmolecular studies in cases where the specimen is scant. Molecular \nalterations demonstrated by IHC may require confirmation by other \ntechniques .  Molecular Characterization  \nPediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas comprise a biologically diverse \ngroup of tumors. There is a high degree of histologic overlap and non -\nspecificity of histologic features amongst the numerous recognized \npathologic entities  of pediatric tumors , which underscores the importance \nof molecular testing in pediatric tumor diagnostics. Molecular testing is \nrequired in many cases to distinguish high -grade tumors from lower \ngrade counterparts, and uncovering alterations that have been \ndemonstrated to be prognostically relev ant.40-45 In addition , clinical trial \nstratification is becoming increasingly dependent on molecular \ncharacterization.  See Table 1 on PGLIO -B 3 of 4  in the algorithm  for \nmolecular alterations of significance in pediatric gliomas .  \nConsidering  the sheer number of genes of interest, in conjunction with \nthe many types of recurrent alterations (including point mutations, \ninsertion/ deletions, copy number variations , and fusions), broad \nmolecular testing is required for comprehensive classification of pediatric \ndiffuse high -grade gliomas . Therefore, the Panel recommends including  \ntests  to detect c opy number changes and gene fusion s via next-\ngeneration sequencing (NGS)  (including ROS1, MET, NTRK1/2/3, ALK, \nand FGFR1/2/3 ), RNA sequencing , or hi gh-resolution copy number \narray . DNA methylation -based analysis may offer objective, more precise \ntumor classification; however, it sho uld not be used as a first -line \nmolecular test . In the pediatric population, dedicated germline testing \nshould be strongly considered in the appropriate clinical context, \nrecognizing that not all sequencing assays readily distinguish between \ngermline and somatic variants.46,47  \nLimited Tissue Sample/Specimen  \nIn cases where there is limited tissue available for processing, care \nshould be taken to prioritize obtaining the following tests : hematoxylin \nand eosin (H&E) histology, limited IHC panel, NGS , and methylation PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

In cases of particularly limited \ntissue, stains for mutations (such as IDH1  R132H or BRAF  V600E) \nalready covered by NGS can be omitted if redundant.  \nPrinciples of Surg ery \nSurgical resection plays an important role in the primary treatment of non-\npontine pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas. The goals of surgery are \nmaximal safe tumor resection, alleviat ion of  symptoms related to \nincreased intracranial pressure or tumor mass effect, increase d survival, \ndecrease d need for corticosteroid s, and o btain ing adequate tissue for \npathologic diagnosis and molecular characterization.  The histology  and \nlocation of the tumor , as well as the extent of possible resection,  are \nsignificant prognostic factors that influence the decision for surgical \nmanagement .48 Surgical resection is not  feasible  for patients with DMG of \nthe pons or most other  brainstem  tumors.  \nPreoperative Assessment  \nAll patients being considered for surgery should undergo a preoperative \nassessment including lab oratory  work , imaging, and multidisciplinary \nconsultation . Advanced imaging can be c onsider ed in cases where \npatients may benefit from it . Emergent situations should be t reated prior to \nfurther investigative studies or interventions . Consider medical \nmanagement to treat focal neurologic deficits, seizure, and pain . However, \nmedications that may alter the patient's neurologic examination or \nincrease surgical risks  should be a voided. Outside of emergent clinical \npresentations, multidisciplinary case discussion should be utilized for \ntreatment planning and optimization of  patient care , including radiation \noncology, neurosurgery, radiology, and oncology/neuro -oncology.  Physical \ntherapy/occupational therapy and sleep and swallow assessments can be \nconsidered to assist with comorbidity management , and referral to a child \nlife social worker can be considered for family/patient support . Surgical Procedure  \nStudy -level and individual patient data meta -analyses  have \ndemonstrated an association between greater extent of resection and \nimproved overall survival (OS) and progression -free survival (PFS)  in \npatients with pediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas .49-56 In the HIT -GBM \nstudy of 85 pediatric patients  with malignant non -pontine gliomas, gross \ntotal resection ( GTR ) was the strongest predictor of OS and event -free \nsurvival (EFS) .55 In the HIT-GBM -C study, 5 -year OS was significantly \nimproved in patients with tumors that were  completely resected prior to \ncombination chemoradiotherapy (63%; N = 21) when compared to \nhistorical controls (17%; P = .003) .54 The Panel recommends maximal \nsafe resection with the goal of image -verified complete resection  \nwhenever possible . In cases where complete resection is not feasible,   \nsubtotal resection  (STR)  for tissue diagnosis and debulking  should be \nconsidered, especially if the patient exhibits symptoms due to mass \neffect . In cases where clinical benefit from cytoreduction is not feasible, \nbiopsy is recommended.   \nNearly all diffuse high -grade gliomas recur. Re -resection at the time of \nrecurrence may improve outcomes , although evidence varies widely .51,57 \nAs in adult patients with diffuse high -grade gliomas, tumor involvement in \nspecific critical brain areas and poor performance status may be \nassociated with unfavorable re -resection outcomes.57  \nPostoperative Management  \nAfter surgical resection, patients should be monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of increased intracranial pressure .

Child life \nspecialists, audio and video distraction techniques, and other pediatric -\nfriendly interventions are recommended to  improve pediatric tolerance of  \nRT without anesthesia.  The dose of RT administered varies depending on \nthe setting and pathology .  \nFollowing surgery, p atients ≥3 years with pediatric diffuse high -grade \ngliomas  (except for those  with pontine  DMG ) are treated with RT  \ncombined with concurrent and/or adjuvant  systemic therapy.59,60 Initiation \nof RT is recommended whenever the patient has recovered from surgery \nand should be gin within 8 weeks of resection. Intensity -modulated RT \n(IMRT)  is used i n most instances  to allow reduction of risk or magnitude of \nside effects from treatment.  Standard  normal tissue constraints should be \nused, and although the prognosis of these patients is often poor, the as \nlow as  reasonably achievable  (ALARA ) principle still applies to the lenses, \nretina, pituitary gland/hypothalamus, cochlea, lacrimal glands, hippocampi,  \ntemporal lobes, spinal cord, and uninvolved brain.  Proton therapy , which \noffers maximal sparing of normal tissue,  may be considered for patients \nwith better prognoses (eg, IDH1 -mutated tumors, 1p/19q -codeleted, \nyounger age) , since most of the data are derived from studies involving \npediatric patients with low -grade glioma .61-65  \nThe majority of studies on reirradiation are from adult high-grade glioma  \nstudies of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  and have suggested \nimprovements in PFS, but limited OS gains .57,66 -69 Multiple dosing \nschedules have been reported for reirradiation, including stereotactic \nradiosurgery (SRS) .57,67 -70 One of the few pediatric studies  conducted was  \na retrospective cohort study of 4 0 children with recurrent supratentorial \nhigh-grade glioma who had received at least one course of RT.71 Of the 40 \nchildren , 14 received reirradiation and had improved median survival from the time of first disease progression when compared with the 26 patients \nwho were not offered reirradiation (9.4 vs . 3.8 months ; P = .005) , \nsuggesting that reirradiation can be effective for short -term disease \ncontrol.  \nPatients with pontine DMG  should begin RT as soon as possible after \ndiagnosis,  regardless of age, given the highly effective nature of this \nmodality for symptom  control .19 Dose -escalated  RT and concurrent or \nadjuvant systemic therapy have produced disappointing results in patients \nwith pontine DMG, and therefore RT dose escalation  beyond the standard \nRT doses  is not recommended.19,72 -76 The Panel recommends using IMRT, \nbut 3D conformal RT is also an acceptable option.18 Hypofractionated RT \nhas been evaluated  as an alternative to standard fractionation in the first-\nline and reirradiation settings, although data are limited and studies are \nongoing to assess the benefits and safety of this approach.77-79 Although \ndata have show n hypofractionated RT to be statistically noninferior to \nconventional RT ,80,81 larger, multi -institution al trials  are needed to \nelucidate  the optimal technique, dose, and fractionation for RT in the \ntreatment of pediatric patients with pontine DMG . Patients with pontine \nDMG  whose tumor s progress  or recur following initial RT have poor \nprognosis and limited treatment options. Palliative r eirradiation has been \nshown to alleviate symptoms  in these patients  and improve quality of \nlife.82-84  \nPrinciples of Systemic Therapy  \nCombined Modality Therapy  \nThe Panel’s preference for the use of RT with concurrent temozolomide \n(TMZ) followed by adjuvant TMZ and lomustine  for patients ≥3 years is \nsupported by the results of the phase II COG ACNS 0423 trial .

Therefore, use of \nthis regimen without lomustine is also an option for adjuvant therapy .60 \nChemotherapy  \nIt is reasonable to  avoid  RT in patients <3 years due to the risk of brain  \ninjury ; therefore,  chemotherapy alone is recommended  for these  \npatients . The chemotherapy regimens recommended by the Panel in this \nsetting are cyclophosphamide ; vincristine, cisplatin , and etoposide ; and \nvincristine, carboplatin , and TMZ.85,86 A Pediatric Oncology Group study  \nshowed that high -grade gliomas in  children <3 years are sensitive to \nchemotherapy.85 In this study, 18 children <3 years with malignant \ngliomas  were treated with  postoperative cyclophosphamide and \nvincristine  for two cycles. Of the 10 patients evaluated for \nneuroradiologic response, the partial response rate was 60% and the 5 -\nyear PFS rate was 43%.  In the Head Start II and III trials, 32 children <6 \nyears with newly  diagnosed high -grade gliomas were treated with four \ncycles of induction chemotherapy with vincristine, carboplatin , and TMZ \nfollowed by myeloablative chemotherapy and autologou s hematopoietic \ncell transplantation .86 The 5 -year E FS and OS rates were 25% and 36%, \nrespectively. Children <3 years had improved 5 -year E FS and OS (44% \nand 63%, respectively) compared to older children (31% and 38% for \nchildren aged 36 –71 months and 0% and 13% for children ≥72 months).  \nTargeted Therapy  \nAdvances in molecular technology have  enabled the development of \nmolecular agents capable of  target ing the biological drivers of pediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas .87 These targeted therapies provide a means \nfor treating pediatric patients without the involvement of cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and radiation. Evidence for the use of s everal targeted \ntherapies in the treatment of patients with pediatric diffuse high -grade \nglioma s with various molecular signatures is  discussed  in further detail  \nbelow.  \nBRAF V600E -Mutated Tumor  \nThe BRAF  V600E point mutation, which results in constitutive activation \nof the MEK/ERK pathway, is detected  in approximately 10 % to 15% of \npediatric high-grade gliomas.88-90 Many tumors that initially respond to \nBRAF  inhibition eventually develop resistance due to reactivation of the \nMAPK pathway .91,92 Combined therapy targeting BRAF  and downstream \nMEK has shown success in several clinical trials in adults  with cancer.91-\n93 However, data on this regimen in the pediatric population are limited to \ncase series and reports.94,95 In one such  case series, three pediatric \npatients with BRAF  V600E –mutat ed high -grade glioma s exhibited clinical \nresponses to combined BRAF/MEK blockade using dabrafenib and \ntrametinib.94 One patient who received the combination as maintenance \ntherapy  following resection and RT remained disease -free for 20 months, \nat which time disease progression was noted. The other two patients \nwho were treated with the combined regimen  at the time of disease \nprogression  or at initial diagnosis  experienced a reduction in tumor size \nand stabilized disease for 32 and 23 months, respectively. None of the \npatients exhibited significant toxicities.  \nBRAF  blockade with vemurafenib has also shown early success in \ntreating patients with pediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas.87,96,97 In the \nphase I trial of the Pediatric Neuro -Oncology Consortium study (PNOC -\n002),  19 pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive  BRAF  V600E –\nmutated high -grade glioma s were treated with vemurafenib for a median \nof 23 cycles.87 One patient had a complete response, 5 patients had PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

G rade \n≥3 adverse events included secondary keratoacanthoma , rash, and \nfever . The phase II part of the trial is currently ongoing  (NCT01748149 ). \nTRK Fusion -Positive Tumor  \nGene fusions involving NTRK1 , NTRK2 , or NTRK3  encode  for TRK \nfusion proteins ( ie, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC) that have increased kinase \nfunction and are implicated in the oncogenesis of many solid tumors.98,99 \nThe small -molecule  TRK inhibitors larotrectinib and entrectinib have \ndemonstrated activity in several trials of adults  and children  with various \ncancers.100-103 In the multicenter phase I SCOUT trial, 24 pediatric and \nadolescent  patients (aged 1 month to 21 years ; median age , 4.5 years ) \nwith advanced solid or primary CNS tumors were treated  with \nlarotrectinib, regardless of TRK fusion status.102 In patients with TRK  \nfusion -positive tumors, the objective response rate (ORR) was 93% \ncompared to 0% in patients without TRK fusion.  In addition to a high \nORR, larotrectinib was also well tolerated, with most patients \nexperiencing only grade 1 adverse events  and dose -limiting toxicity in \none patient . The phase II part of this trial is currently ongoing \n(NCT02637687 ). \nThe phase I/II STARTRK -NG trial assessed the activity of entrectinib in \n43 pediatric patients (aged <22 years) with solid tumors including \nprimary CNS tumors , regardless of TRK fusion status.101 In patients with \nTRK fusion -positive tumors, the ORR was 5 8% and the median duration \nof treatment was 1 1 months. The median duration of response was not \nreached . Treatment with entrectinib resulted in antitumor activity in \npatients with TRK  fusion -positive tumors ; however,  it also led to  dose -\nlimiting toxicities in four patients  (9%). T he most common treatment -\nrelated adverse event s were  weight gain (4 9%) and bone fractures \n(21%). The phase II part of this trial is currently ongoing ( NCT02650401 ).  Based on the TRIDENT trial, th e FDA issued accelerated approval for \nrepotrectinib , another NTRK -based regimen, for  adult and pediatric \npatients ≥12 years with solid tumors that have a n NTRK  gene fusion, are \nlocally advanced or metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to \nresult in severe morbidity, and that have progressed following treatment \nor have no satisfactory alternative therapy.104,105 An ongoing phase I/II \nCARE study is recruiting children and young adults with advanced or \nmetastatic solid tumors to evaluate repotrectinib in combination with \nchemotherapy  (NCT05004116 ). The Panel recommends repotrectinib as  \nan option  in both adjuvant and recurrent or progressive disease for  \ndiffuse high -grade gliomas .  \nALK Rearrangement -Positive  Tumor  \nThe Panel included  options for ALK rearrangement -positive, high-grade \ngliomas based on studies/case report  for this  hard-to-treat young \npopulation group. Alectinib and lorlatinib were tolerated in th ese small \nsubgroup s and showed clinical ly beneficial outcomes.106,107 Both alectinib \nand lorlatinib are included as options  in both adjuvant and recurrent or \nprogressive disease for diffuse high -grade gliomas.  \nHypermutant Tumor  \nThe inherited cancer predisposition syndrome  CMMRD  often leads to the \ndevelopment of pediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas characterized by a \nhigher mutational burden  than typically seen in sporadically occurring \nbrain tumors or other solid tumors .108 The resultant hypermutant tumors  \nmay be amenable to immune checkpoint inhibition ; however, evidence of \ntheir efficacy is currently limited to case reports and single -institution \nexperiences.108-110 In one such case report, two siblings with recurrent  \nhypermutant pediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas were treated with the  \nanti-programmed cell death  protein 1 (PD -1) inhibitor nivolumab , which \nresulted in significant clinical  and radiologic responses in both children \nfollowing several months of treatment.108 A retrospective chart review of  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

T argeted therapy based on the molecular composition of the \ntumor is recommended for patients with good performance status . This \nincludes but is not limited to the following: checkpoint blockade for high \ntumor mutational burden (TMB) or personal or family history of CMMRD ; \nRAF and MEK inhibition for tumors with BRAF  V600E mutation, TRK \ninhibitors for tumors with NTRK gene fusion , and ALK inhibitors for ALK \nrearrangement -positive tumors .  \nPatients with poor performance status may receive palliative \nchemotherapy with oral etoposide ,111 bevacizumab (or a U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration [ FDA]-approved biosimilar) ,112 or single -agent  \nnitrosoureas (lomustine or carmustine).59 In a phase II trial , 28 children \nwith recurrent brain and solid tumors received daily oral etoposide  for 21 \nconsecutive days  with courses repeating  every 28 days pending bone \nmarrow recovery.111 Three out of the four patients with medulloblastoma \nexhibited a partial response and two of the five patients with ependymoma \nhad a response (one with a complete response and one with a partial \nresponse) , demonstrating activity for etoposide in recurrent brain tumors.  \nToxicity was manageable with only one hospitalization for neutropenic \nfever  and two patients who withdrew due to treatment -related adverse events  (one with grade 4 thrombocytopenia and one with grade 2 \nmucositis).  \nThe multicenter phase II HERBY trial  evaluated the addition of \nbevacizumab to RT plus TMZ for treatment of pediatric patients (N = 121 ; \naged between 3 and 18 years ) with newly diagnosed non -pontine high -\ngrade gliomas.112 Median EFS did not differ significantly between the \ntreatment groups  and the addition of bevacizumab did not reduce the risk \nof death. Adding bevacizumab  to RT  + TMZ did not improve EFS in \npediatric patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma s. Therefore,  the \nPanel has reserved use of bevacizumab  (or an FDA -approved biosimilar) \nas a single agent in the palliati ve setting for patients with  recurrent or \nprogressive disease . \nBrief Summary of NCCN Recommendations  for Diffuse High-Grade \nGliomas  \nRadiologic Prese ntation and Multidisciplinary Review  \nWhen a patient presents with a clinical and radiologic p icture suggestive \nof pediatric diffuse high -grade glioma s, input from a  multidisciplinary \nteam is needed for  treatment planning . The involvement of pediatric \noncologists/neuro -oncologists, pediatric radiation oncologists, \npathologists with expertise in neuropathology and molecular pathology, \npediatric neuroradiologists , and pediatric neurosurgeons with specific \nexpertise in the management of pediatric high -grade gliomas is strongly \nencouraged. Neurosurgical input is needed to determine the feasibility of \nmaximal safe resection.  A pathologic diagnosis is critical and may be \ndifficult to accurately determine without sufficient tumor tissue  obtained \ndurin g biopsy .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-14 verified complete resection,  whenever possible. If the patient is \nsymptomatic because of mass tumor effect but complete resection is not \nfeasible, then subtotal resection is recommended for tissue diagnosis and \ndebulking. A postoperative MRI is recommended, ideally within 24  to 48 \nhours after surgery,  to confirm extent of resection.21-24 If a clinically \nbeneficial cytoreduction is not feasible, then a stereotactic biopsy or open \nbiopsy is recommended for pathologic analysis. Recommendations for \nmolecular testing of diffuse high -grade glioma tumors are provided in the \nalgorithm . The resulting information should be used to form a pathologic \ndiagnosis. Detection of genetic alterations may also expand clinical trial \noptions for the patient.   \nAdjuvant Therapy  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends clinical trial enrollment whenever \npossible as the preferred treatment option for all pediatric patients with \ndiffuse high -grade gliomas. Outside of a clinical trial, p atients ≥3 years \nwith pediatric diffuse high -grade gliomas, except DMG,  H3 K27-altered  \nor other tumor  with a pontine tumor location , can receive standard brain \nRT with concurrent and adjuvant TMZ without lomustine or with \nlomustine (preferred).59,60 Standard brain RT alone and standard brain \nRT with concurrent TMZ and adjuvant targeted therapy based upon the \nmolecular composition of the tumor are also options in this setting. \nPatients <3 years can receive systemic chemotherapy with either \ncyclophosphamide, vincristine, cisplatin , and etoposide85 or vincristine, \ncarboplatin , and TMZ86 to delay the need for RT or with adjuvant \ntargeted therapy based upon the molecular composition of the tumor.  \nPatients with non-pontine DMG,  H3 K27-altered can receive  either \nstandard brain RT alone or standard brain RT with concurrent and \nadjuvant TMZ alone  or with lomustine. Patients with pontine located \ntumors, including  DMG,  H3 K27-altered  or pediatric diffuse high -grade \nglioma, H3 wild-type, and IDH wild-type, should receive standard brain \nRT alone if clinical trial enrollment is not possible.  Follow -up and Recurrence  \nMost pediatric p atients with diffuse high -grade gliomas  eventually develop \ntumor recurrence or progression. Therefore, patients should be followed \nclosely with brain MRI scans starting at 2  to 6 weeks post -irradiation, then \nevery 2  to 3 months for 1 year, then every 3  to 6 months indefinitely after \nthe completion of treatment for newly diagnosed disease. Pseudo -\nprogression may occur within 6  to 9 months after RT and can be seen on \nMRI; therefore, pseudo -progression should be considered if MRI changes \nare no ted in this period. Management of recurrent or progressive disease  \ndepends on the extent of disease and the patient ’s condition.  The efficacy \nof current treatment options remains poor; therefore, enrollment in a \nclinical trial, whenever possible, is preferred  for the management of \nrecurrent or progressive disease . Surgical resection of locally recurrent \ndisease is reasonable followed by an additional brain MRI scan . However, \nenrollment in a phase 0 or preoperative clinical trial should be considered \nbefore resection.  If recurrent  or progressive  local disease is not resectable \nor if it is diffuse with multiple lesions, then surgery can still be considered \nfor large symptomatic lesions. Re -resection at the time of recurrence may \nimprove outcomes; however, tumor involvement in specific critical brain \nareas and poor performance status  may be associated with unfavorable \nre-resection outcomes.  In cases of poor performance status or where \naggressive therapy is unlikely to provide meaningful survival benefit, \npalliat ive and best supportive care including family -centered care with \nattention  on quality of life is recommended.   \nPreferred systemic ther apy options for recurrent disease include but are \nnot limited to dabrafenib/trametinib94 or vemurafenib87 for BRAF  V600E -\nmutated tumors, larotrectinib102 or entrectinib101 for TRK fusion -positive \ntumors, nivolumab108,109 or pembrolizumab110 for hypermutant tumors , and \nlorlatinib or alectinib for ALK rearrangement -positive tumors . Reirradiation, \nif feasible, is an alternative option. Patient s with poor performance status  \nshould receive palliative/best supportive care.

However , with advances in multimodality therapies \napproximately 75% children with medulloblastoma will have prolonged \nsurvival .114 Pediatric medulloblastoma c onsists of at least four distinct \nmolecular subtypes , which  include s wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog \n(SHH), Group 3, and Group 4.115 Group 3 and 4 have been combined \nand are collectively referred to as “Non-WNT/non-SHH ” \nmedulloblastoma. Incidence of the different molecular subtype s of \nmedulloblastoma can vary with age and sex  and are detailed in this \nsection .115,116 Current therapeutic regimens are highly effective for certain \nmolecular groups of medulloblastoma leading to a high rate of cure in \nthese subgroups. WNT-activated tumors represent 10% of \nmedulloblastoma  and are most common in children age d 7 to 14 years \nwith a good prognosis ( long-term survival rates >90%). The SHH -\nactivated, TP53 -wild-type or -mutant tumors  represent  10% to 20% of \nmedulloblastomas , and TP53  mutations and/or MYCN  amplification in \nthis subtype  is associated with poor prognosis.  The WHO classifies \nSHH -activated/ TP53 -wild-type and SHH -activated/ TP53 -mutant tumors  \nas separate subtypes.  TP53  mutation and MYCN  amplification are \nassociated with each other and  with a very poor outcome worse than that \nof TP53  mutation alone .117 Finally , group 3 and 4 tumors represent about 25% to 35% of medulloblastomas , respectively . Even though they are \ncombined, g roup 3 tumors have a less favorable prognosis ( 5-year \nsurvival rates between 20%–30%) compared to group 4 tumors ( OS \nrates between 75%–90%).  \nRisk Factors /Genetic Predisposition  \nThe risk factors  for pediatric medulloblastoma are not well -known. \nHowever, certain genetic conditions and germline mutations  are \nassociated with a higher  risk of developing medulloblastoma at a young \nage. These include Li-Fraumeni syndrome  that occurs due to  germline \nTP53  mutations and/or family history of certain cancers ; Turcot \nsyndrome/Lynch syndrome/CMMRD  that present s with mutations in \nhMSH2 , hMSH6 , hMLH1 , and hPMS2 ; and Gorlin syndrome (nevoid \nbasal cell carcinoma syndrome [NBCCS ]).118 Germline mutations in APC, \nBRCA2 , PALB2 , GPR161 , ELP1 , CREBBP , and EP300  can also \npredispos e children to develop pediatric medulloblastoma.119 The WNT \nand SHH subgroup s have the highest occurrence of t hese mutations and \nsyndromes , with a much lower frequency of genetic alterations in group 3 \nand 4 tumors. Individuals who should be referred to evaluation of cancer \npredisposition include those whose tumors harbor genetic alterations  or \nwith a clinical history  suggestive of predisposition to inherited cancer.  \nThe Panel notes that genetics associated risk factors may be updated in \nthe future with emerging data  and new discoveries in this field . \nClinical Presentation  \nThe symptoms, which can develop in weeks or gradually over months, \ncan be intermittent and subtle at first. The most  common symptoms  \ninclude consequences  of increased intracranial pressure, such as \nheadache, nausea , and vomiting. Prolonged elevated intracranial \npressure can lead to papilledema and changes in  vision .17 Other \npresenting symptoms include ataxia, cranial nerve deficits, loss of \ndevelopmental milestones, and back pain.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-16 Treatment Overview  \nTreatment for medulloblastoma includes surgery, RT, and chemotherapy. \nThe g oals of surgery include maximal safe resection, to reduc e tumor -\nassociated mass effect, to provide relief from hydrocephalus, and to \nobtain  adequate tissue for histologic and molecular classification.  The \nPanel encourages  enrollment in molecular classification -based clinical \ntrials , if available . Postoperative staging should include molecular \nfindings along with clinical factors to ascertain risk for recurrence that \ninforms adjuvant therapy  options . Given the younger age of diagnosis, \nthe Panel r ecommend s referr ing patients to infertility risk/fertility \npreservation counseling especially for those who are or will be  treated \nwith chemotherapy. The Panel also suggests  referring to the NCCN \nGuidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology . The Panel \nnotes that treatment for children <3 years is not covered in this guideline.  \nPrinciples of Neuroi maging  \nThe current guideline  recommendations  incorporate imaging followed by  \nmolecular subtyping to determine risk for recurrence and \nadjuvant/maintenance therapy. The Panel  includes imaging modalities , \namong other tests,  as follow -up/surveillance tools after adjuvant therapy \nto monitor response and  disease status. The recommendations for \nimaging medulloblastomas mostly  follow  that of diffuse high-grade \ngliomas. However , keeping in mind the challenges associated with \ncertain molecular subtypes , there are certain key differences regarding \ntumor appear ance  on imaging and/or acqui sition of  high-quality images  \nthat are listed below:  \n• Pediatric medulloblastoma usually appears as a large, heterogeneous, \nposterior fossa mass that occupies either the fourth ventricle  or \ncerebellar hemisphere. The mass characteristically demonstrates \nreduced diffusion due to high cellularity , with most cases exhibiting  heterogeneous cyst formation  or necrosis, with var ying degrees of \nenhancement .  \n \n• Medulloblastoma associated with leptomeningeal dissemination  in the \nspine is more evident  on an MRI .120 The Panel recommends obtaining  \nsagittal T2 -weighted  images, and postcontrast sagittal and axial T1 -\nweighted images of the entire spine. Additional sequences such as \nhigh-resolution heavily T2 -weighted  images, 3D bSSFP sequence \n(CISS/FIESTA -C), and/or DWI may be helpful and , when feasible , \nshould also be obtained .121 Furthermore , the apparent diffusion \ncoefficient (ADC) value calculation using DWI , among other imaging \nfeatures,  may aid in predicting molecular subtypes and optimiz ing \nplanning related to surgery.122,123  \n \n• FDG -PET/CT c an be a useful imaging tool in evaluating pediatric \nmedulloblastoma. A case study involving serial MRIs in a 20 -year-old \nafter radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy showed no disease \nprogression even though the patient had declining functional \nabilities.124 A follow -up FDG -PET/CT evaluation showed increased \nuptake along the length of the thecal sac suggesting metastatic \ndisease , which was confirmed by spine MRI imag ing with gadolinium \ncontrast. In another study of patients with medulloblastoma ( N = 22) , \nincreased  FDG  uptake correlated negatively with survival.125 These \nstudies suggest the potential utility of FDG -PET/CT in evaluating \nmetastatic disease  and prognosis . \n \n• Deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques using  imaging \nscans to predict the m olecular sub types are currently being \ninvestigated . While acknowledging that such studies  are in very early \nstages of development , the Panel notes that t here is a possibility of \nimproving  medulloblastoma classification by merging data from \ntextured images and the original histopathologic images.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-17 retrospective study across 12 international pediatric sites  (N = 263)  \napplied machine learning to MRI scans and constructed algorithms to \npredict the four major molecular subtypes  with some success .126 \nAnother study found an  increased frequency of equivocal findings on \nMRI in the SHH subtype compared to any other molecular \nsubgroup.127 Based on these and other ongoing studies, t he Panel \nnotes that evaluation s combin ing radiology and genomics could \nbecome more clinically relevant  in the  future.  \nPrinciples of Neurop athology  \nAll types of medulloblastomas are embryonal tumors composed of small, \npoorly differentiated cells with high nuclear:cytoplasmic  ratio, increased  \nmitotic activity, and prominent apoptosis. All medulloblastomas are CNS \nWHO grade 4  and categorized by molecular group based on the 2021 \nCNS WHO Classification (5th edition) .6 Morphologic patterns remain a \ncritical clinicopathologic tool that can correlat e well with molecular \nsubtypes and in some cases even predict  molecular  findings . However, \nsome observed morpholog ic patterns  (for example: large cell/anaplastic \nhistology ) are subjective  and depend on the pathologist’s  expertise ; \ntherefore , molecular characterization is now the gold standard for \nmedulloblastoma classification . IHC analysis can provide rapid screening \nfor specific genetic alterations ( eg, β-catenin, p53, INI1/SMARCB1 ). \nAltogether , the Panel deems  integration of morphologic, IHC, and \nmolecular data as necessary for diagnosing and treating pediatric \nmedulloblastomas . In addition, the Panel recommends germline testing \nand genetic counseling  in all diagnosed cases  of medulloblastoma . \nMolecular Characterization  \nThe well-established  molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma include \nWNT -activated, SHH -activated/ TP53  wild-type, SHH -activated/ TP53 -\nmutant, and combined Groups 3 and 4 , and are characterized by specific \ngenetic alterations .115,119,128 -130 WNT -activated tumors are distinguished by CTNNB1 mutation in 90% of cases  and usually result in a positive \nnuclear β-catenin IHC and chromosome 6 loss, whereas germline \nmutations like CMMRD  and APC are rare in this subtype . IHC for β-\ncatenin may particularly be helpful to demonstrate WNT  pathway \nactivation in patients within  the low-risk group within  WNT -activated \nmedulloblastoma.  In SHH -activated /TP53  wild-type tumors , frequent \nmutations , including those in PTCH1  (Gorlin syndrome), SUFU , SMO , \nMLL1 , MYCN , LDB1 , and GLI1 , occur . In contrast , DNA methylation \nchanges appear  more commonly in SHH -activated /TP53 -mutant  tumors . \nGroup 3 and 4 tumors are generally not associated with germline \nmutations but MYC  amplification and isodicentric 17q alterations can be \nfound in select cases. The Panel notes that although DNA m ethylation \nprofiling is robust for medulloblastoma subtyping, the data are yet to fully \nmature  and therefore  are not currently included in the se guidelines. The \nPanel recommends that w hen DNA methylation analysis is performed, \nthese findings should be integrated with genetic profiling  that includes \ngermline testing .  \nAfter in-depth discussion, t he Panel decided that considering molecular \nfeatures in the context of clinical finding s is the best approach  to risk-\nstratify  patients . Factors considered as risk for recurrence , based on \ncurrent evidence  and Panel consensus , are described in the algorithm \npages (PMB -2 and PMB -3). The Panel agrees that metastatic disease,  \nSTR,  or MYC  amplification will automatically classify  a patient into the \nhigh-risk group irrespective of  the molecular subgroup . However, the \nprognosis of patients with high-risk features may vary with different  \nmolecular characteristics . Furthermore, discerning molecular features \ncan be important for enrolling patients into appropriate clinical trials. For \nV.1.2025, the intermediate risk category for Groups 3 and 4 tumors was \nremoved since  the P anel felt that this risk category is an ongoing are a of \ninvestigation and does not have enough  compelling  evidence to be put in \ncurrent clinical  practice.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-18 can depend on age ; for example: a 4 -year old’s relative risk with M0, \nGTR, MYC  gain, large cell/anaplastic histology may be viewed differently \nfrom a 10 -year old’s relative risk with the same features. These nuances \nshould be kept in mind and clinical judgement should be used to treat \nthese patients . Diagnosis of  large cell/anaplastic histology is subjective , \nespecially in cases of mixed histology, and  varies across different \ninstitutions. While noting that large cell/anaplastic histology usually \noccurs wit h some other clinical/histologic/molecular features , the Panel \ndetermined  that diagnosis of large cell/anaplastic histology alone is not \nconsidered as a risk factor for recurrence.  Additionally , MYC  gain is \ndifferent from MYC  amplification,  but the distinguish ing features  between \nthe two are not clearly defined . The Panel contends that m ore data  are \nneed ed to integrate the subtle differences between gains and \namplifications  into risk stratification . Finally, t he Panel emphasized that \nthe molecular classification and associated risk stratification , particularly  \nfor pediatric medulloblastoma , is an evolving field and will be  update d \nbased on ongoing studies and available data.  \nPrinciples of Surgery  \nThe principles of surgery for medulloblastoma are largely similar to high -\ngrade gliomas.  One of the primary goals during  surgery is to maintain the \nfine balance between maximal cytoreduction and  preserving  quality of \nlife of the patient. Additional considerations for surgical resection of \nmedulloblastoma are listed below.  \n• Initial surgery should be performed with the goal of GTR while \nminimizing neurologic deficits incurred from surgery. Near total \nresection (NTR) (≤1.5 cm2 residual) is  acceptable in some settings. \nLess than NTR is also acceptable after review postoperatively by a \nmultidisciplinary team.  A retrospective s tudy that included  787 patients \nfound that extent of resection in only Group 4 tumors w as associated \nwith poor survival, with the authors acknowledging that the reason behind this correlation is not clear.114 Other studies have shown that \nextent of residual tumor is correlated with PFS in kids with no \ndisseminated  disease.131,132  \n \n• Medulloblastoma u sually appears as a p osterior fossa mass , but the \nnature of the mass may vary depending on the subtype.  For example, \nthe WNT medulloblastoma subtype is known to display intratumoral \nhemorrhage more frequently than the other molecular subtype .133  \n \n• The Panel recommends obtain ing adequate  tissue for histopathologic \ndiagnosis and molecular genetic characterization.  Molecular findings \nafter surgery are important for further risk stratification.  \n \n• For patients with resectable residual disease , the Panel contends  \nconsidering  if a second -look surgery is acceptable. Careful re -\ninspection of the area of resected tumor can reveal residual disease.134 \nRe-resection at the time of recurrence may confer OS benefit in the \nsetting of a single, focal posterior fossa recurrence.  \n \n• Any medulloblastoma that recurs  after 3  to 5 years  could be a second  \nmalignancy. Therefore , the Panel e mphasize s the need  to re-biopsy \nthe tumor to distinguish b etween medulloblastoma  and diffuse high -\ngrade gliomas . Biopsy of recurrent disease may also identify \nactionable molecular findings, or rarely, a secondary malignancy.  \n \n• The Panel notes that CSF diversion techniques including \nventriculoperitoneal shunt or endoscopic third ventriculostomy are \nacceptable.   \nPrinciples of Radiation Therapy Management  \nRadiation is an essential component of adjuvant therapy  for all risk \ncategories  of medulloblastoma and improves  survival for at least 20% of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

Craniospinal irradiation  (CSI) for primary disease is critical,  \nregardless of molecular subtype , to achieve potential cure  of \nmedulloblastomas .135,136 For high-risk subgroups , an elevated CSI dose \nis recommended whereas a lower dose is recommended for low-risk \nsubgroups . Using a lower dose of radiation , thought to have the same \ntherapeutic efficacy, while retaining  neurocognitive outcomes have not \nshown benefit  when the molecular subtypes are analyzed as  one \ngroup .137 It is yet to be determined  whether lower doses can be still be \neffective for certain molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma  (eg, WNT ); \nthis is a topic of investigation in some clinical trials, including \nNCT02724579  and NCT01878617 . In the recurrent setting, reirradiation \nis primarily based on clinical judgment, and a higher dose can be used  \nespecially  if the patient did  not receive any radiation ( an unusual \nscenario) as part of adjuvant treatment.   \nCertain chemotherapy agents are thought to act as radiosensitizers . In a \nrandomized phase 3 trial, treatment with carboplatin during radiation \nimproved EFS by 19% only in children with high -risk group 3 \nmedulloblastoma.138 The authors did observe  higher toxicities in patients \nwho received carboplatin during RT , which were attributed to an intense \ntreatment schedule . Nevertheless , this study emphasizes  the importance \nof molecular stratification , which  can provide information about which \npatient  subgroup  is most  likely to  benefit from certain treatments . Based \non th e study , the Panel recommends carboplatin prior to each RT \nfraction only for group 3 tumors  with very high risk of recurrence ( MYC  \namplification) .  \nA cohort study of patients with medulloblastoma showed that proton \nradiotherapy may be associated with  more favorable   intellectual \noutcomes , measured by global intelligence quotient ( IQ), perceptual \nreasoning, and working memory scores,  compared to  photon \nradiotherapy.139 The authors note d that modern photon radiotherapy techniques can result in  intellectual benefits;  however , they still favored \nproton radiotherapy.  Photon radiotherapy is also associated with side \neffects .140-142 The Panel notes that i t is important to remain vigilant \nregarding potential radiotherapy related morbidities, such as brainstem \ninjury, as date matures for the modern techniques . Regardless of the \ntype of therapy used, the Panel emphasizes the need for utilizing optim al \nnormal tissue -sparing techniques  during radiotherapy planning and \nadministration .  \nThere is some concern about secondary malignancies due to RT; \nhowever , the Panel feels that such risk can be largely attributed to \ngermline mutations , including TP53 , that predispose individuals to certain \ncancers. Finally, the Panel encourages clinical trial enrollment ; if a \npatient is enrolled in a clinical trial, the protocol recommendations and \nnormal tissue dose constraints  of the trial should be met.  \nPrinciples of Systemic Therapy  \nAdjuvant Chemoradiation Followed by Maintenance Chemotherapy  \nThe therapy for all risk categories consists of chemoradiation followed by \nmaintenance chemotherapy. The m aintenance  treatment schedule  from \nthe Children’s Oncology Group ( COG ) or St. Jude protocol can be \nutilized. However, these protocols are not interchangeable. Toxicity \nshould be monitored during treatment , including neuropathy associated \nwith vincristine and ototoxicity associated with cisplatin. The Panel \nrecommends slightly different chemoradiation regimens for low -/average -\nrisk and high -/very -high-risk categories.  \nLow and Average  Risk \nA randomized phase III trial (N = 464 eligible and evaluable patients ) \nconducted by the COG  studied weekly vincristine with radiotherapy ; after \n6 weeks patients received maintenance chemotherapy that cycle d \nbetween  cisplatin/lomustine/vincristine and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-20 cisplatin/ cyclophosphamide/vincristine.137 All the  molecular subtypes of \nmedulloblastoma were represented in this study with group 4 tumors \ncomprising the largest subgroup. In all patients, o utcomes including EFS \nand OS were comparable between posterior fossa and involved -field RT. \nHowever, the study showed that using low -dose CSI may not be as \nefficient as using standard -dose CSI. Another study conducted by \ninvestigators at St. Jude (N = 330) utilized a similar dosing strategy for \nCSI and primary chemotherapy , while  maintenance consisted of \nvincri stine /cisplatin/cyclophosphamide.143 Group 4 tumors were the \nlargest proportion  of subtypes  among  the molecular subtypes in this \nstudy . In general, the outcomes of this trial were comparable to \npreviously performed prospective studies.  Based on these two studies, \nthe Panel recommends weekly vincristine with RT (COG) that can be \nfollowed  by maintenance therapy from either the COG or St. Jude trial  as \noptions for low -/average -risk disease .  \nHigh and Very High Risk  \nStudies have investigated  potential radiosensitizing  effects o f \ncarboplatin.138,144 The addition of carboplatin during radiotherapy \nimprove d clinical outcomes in highrisk group 3 tumors. Therefore, the \nPanel recommends carboplatin prior to each RT fraction  for group 3 \ntumors with very high risk for recurrence ( MYC  amplification ). The Panel \nrecommends using the St. Jude trial protocol or the ACNS0332 protocol \n(consisting of 6 cycles of chemotherapy includ ing c isplatin, \ncyclophosphamide, and vincristin e) as maintenance options for high - and \nvery-high-risk disease .  \nRecurrent or Progressive Disease  \nRecurrent or progressive disease after first -line therapy is observed in \napproximately one -third of the patients  and is associated with \nsignificantly lower  survival rates  of <10% . Given the low survival rates, \nrecurrent/progressive medulloblastoma is thought of as high -risk disease . Therefo re, a combination of systemic therapies  based on \nexisting data , described below,  are options  for aggressive ly treating \nrecurrence/progressive disease. The Panel also encourages patients \nwith recurrent or progressive disease to participate in clinical trials.  \nTemozolomide (TMZ) and Irinotecan + Bevacizumab (TEMR)  \nThe addition of bevacizumab to TMZ and irinotecan demonstrated a 3 -\nmonth benefit to EFS (6 months without bevacizumab vs. 9 months with \nbevacizumab) in a phase II screening trial of patients with recurrent \nmedulloblastoma or CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) .145 \nBoth arms had similar toxicity profiles. Therefore, this regimen is \nincluded as an option to treat recurrent or progressive disease. The \nPanel notes that bevacizumab initiation can be delayed  to ensure  \nappropriate  wound healing  in patients who recently had surgery.  \nTMZ/ Topotecan (TOTEM)  \nIn a phase 2 basket trial, treatment with TMZ/topotecan led to a  28% \noverall objective response rate  in a small cohort of pediatric patients with \nrecurrent/refractory medulloblastoma .146 Hematologic toxicities were \nfrequently observed in patients treated with TMZ/topotecan.  \nMEMMAT Regimen  \nMetronomic antiangiogenic therapies are low doses of anticancer  drugs \nthat are administered on a regular basis over long periods of time.147 Two \npotential advantages of such low-dose regimens include  lowering  side \neffects and readministering drugs previously given at high doses to \ncircumvent tumor resistance.147 A few phase II trials and a retrospective \nanalysis showed  the benefit of MEMMAT or “MEMMAT -like” regimens in \ntreating pediatric medulloblastoma.148,149 Phase II trials in pediatric \npatients with recurrent or progressive  CNS  tumors evaluated  disease \nprogression after treatment with these regimens for up to 7 months.150,151 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:57:42 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPediatric Central Nervous System Cancers  \n \nMS-21 These trials  showed acceptable toxicity profiles and promising clinical \nactivity in a subset of patients.  \nCarboplatin/ Etoposide  \nA phase II  window -of-opportunity trial that included patients with \nrecurrent medulloblastoma (n = 93)  investigated the efficacy of three \narms (non -randomized): carboplatin/etoposide, oral chemotherapy with \nTMZ, and a documentation arm that included patients not treated with \nthe two regimens .152 Patients on the carboplatin/etoposide arm had \nbetter ORRs  compared to those who received TMZ (51.8% vs. 18.2%). \nThe authors noted that both hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities \nwere observed but were manageable. The clinical outcomes of this trial \nwere comparable to trials that investigated TOTEM or \nTMZ/irinotecan/bevacizumab . \nBrief Summary of NCCN Recommendations  for Medulloblastoma  \nRadiologic Presentation and Multidisciplinary Review  \nA contrast -enhanced MRI compatible with primary brain tumor is the \npreferred method to perform radiologic evaluation of medulloblastoma. \nThe Panel recommends that multidisciplinary review be conducted  once \npathology reports are evaluated,  and this should be performed before \nsurgery.  \nPrimary Treatment  \nThe primary treatment consists of surgery followed by adjuvant therapy. \nThe goals of surgery include GTR ; if that is not possible then maximal \nsafe resection is an option. The Panel strongly recommends referring the \npatient to a pediatric brain tumor center for evaluation of possible more \ncomplete surgical resection  when open biopsy or STR are being \nconsidered . STR may be  warranted o nly if the patient  has gross \nleptomeningeal disease and no detectable primary site . Postoperative \nstaging includes brain/spine MRI, CSF, and molecular analysis. Postoperative imaging is required for the brain only and i s ideally \nobtained within the first 24 –72 hours (within 24 hours preferred).  If spine \nMRI is not performed  prior to surgery, imaging should wait 10  to 14 days \npostoperatively to get an accurate image . The Panel notes that rapid -\nsequence MRI is not a substitute for a full brain and spine  MRI when \nstaging or assessing for response evaluation.  Timely m olecular testing of \nmedulloblastoma is recommended , which informs risk stratification \nbefore adjuvant treatment.  \nAdjuvant Therapy  \nAdjuvant treatment consists of chemoradiation followed by maintenance \nchemotherapy. CSI and chemotherapy recommendations differ for low -\n/average -risk and high -/very -high-risk disease.  \nFollow -up and Recurrence  \nThe algorithm lists details of recommended follow -up tests and \nsurveillance methods. This includes endocrine tests at least annually for 5 \nyears to ensure institutions and doctors can best follow -up with patients on \nan individualized basis. If thyroid -stimulating hormone ( TSH) or growth \nfailure is suspected, endocrine tests can be performed more frequently. \nThe oncologist may also refer to an endocrinologist i f any of the endocrine \ntest results raise suspicion. Recurrent/progressive disease  can be treated \nwith combined chemotherapy regimens. The Panel encourages enrollment \nin clinical trials. Palliative/supportive care that includes radiation and \nadditional resection are also included as options for recurrent/progressive \ndiseas e. \n \nSummary  \nPediatric CNS cancers are the leading cause of cancer -related death in \nchildren.
