Monocytopenia is characteristic. \nc HCLv (ICC)/SBLPN (WHO5) is characteristically CD25-, CD123-, \nannexin A1-, and negative for BRAF V600E mutations. This helps to \ndistinguish HCLv (ICC)/SBLPN (WHO5) form from cHCL. \nd See Use of Immunophenotyping/Genetic Testing in Differential Diagnosis \nof Mature B-Cell and NK/T-Cell Neoplasms in the NCCN Guidelines for \nB-Cell Lymphomas .DIAGNOSISaWORKUP\nESSENTIAL:\n• Bone marrow biopsy ± aspirate: \n\u0017Presence of characteristic hairy cells upon \nmorphologic examination of peripheral blood or bone \nmarrow and characteristic infiltrate with increased \nreticulin in bone marrow biopsy samples. Dry tap is \nfrequent. \n• Adequate immunophenotyping is essential for \nestablishing the diagnosis and for distinguishing \nbetween classical hairy cell leukemia (cHCL) and \nhairy cell variant (HCLv;ICC)/splenic B-cell lymphoma/\nleukemia with prominent nucleoli (SBLPN;WHO5)b,c,d\n\u0017Immunohistochemistry (IHC) or flow cytometry for: \nCD19, CD20, CD5, CD10, CD11c, CD22, CD25, CD103, \nCD123, cyclin D1, and CD200\nUSEFUL UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES:\n• Molecular analysis to detect: IGHV4-34 rearrangemente\n• IHC or molecular analysis to detect BRAF V600E \nmutation for cases that do not have cHCL \nimmunophenotypeeESSENTIAL:\n• History and physical exam with attention to node-\nbearing areas and the measurement of size of liver \nand spleen\n\u0017Presence of enlarged spleen and/or liver; \npresence of peripheral lymphadenopathy \n(uncommon)\n• Performance status\n• Peripheral blood smear examination\n• Complete blood count (CBC) with differential\n• Comprehensive metabolic panel with particular \nattention to renal function\n• Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)\n• Bone marrow biopsy ± aspirate\n• Hepatitis Bf and C testing if treatment contemplated\nUSEFUL UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES:\n• CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast of \ndiagnostic quality\n• Pregnancy testing in patients of childbearing age (if \nsystemic therapy planned)\n• Discussion of fertility preservationgInitial Treatment \n(HCL-2)\ne Ten percent to 20% of B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms with a cHCL phenotype \npossess IGHV4-34 rearrangements and typically lack BRAF V600E mutations. These \ndiseases behave more like HCLv (ICC)/SBLPN (WHO5) in that they do not respond \nwell to purine analog therapy and generally have a poorer prognosis. There is evidence \nthat HCLv (ICC)/SBLPN (WHO5) and IGHV4-34–mutant HCL often show mutations in \nMAP2K1.\nf Hepatitis B testing is indicated because of the risk of reactivation during treatment (eg, \nimmunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy). See Treatment \nand Viral Reactivation in the NCCN Guidelines for CLL/SLL . Tests include hepatitis B \nsurface antigen and core antibody for a patient with no risk factors. For patients with risk \nfactors or previous history of hepatitis B, add e-antigen. If positive, check viral load and \nconsult with gastroenterologist.\ng Fertility preservation options include: sperm banking, semen cryopreservation, in vitro \nfertilization (IVF), or ovarian tissue or oocyte cryopreservation.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:29 PM.

In those patients being treated with pentostatin, the bone marrow can be evaluated after the \nblood counts have nearly normalized and the physical examination shows no splenomegaly.\nComplete response \n(CR)Near normalization of peripheral blood counts: hemoglobin >11 g/dL (without transfusion); platelets >100,000/mcL; \nANC >1500/mcL.

Absence of morphologic evidence of HCL on \nboth the peripheral blood smear and the bone marrow examination.\nCR with or without \nminimal residual \ndisease (MRD)If CR is achieved, an IHC assessment of the percentage of MRD will be useful to stratify patients based on level of \nCR (with or without evidence of MRD ). \nPartial response \n(PR)A PR requires near normalization of the peripheral blood count (as in CR) with a minimum of 50% improvement in\norganomegaly and bone marrow biopsy infiltration with HCL.\nStable disease (SD) Patients whose disease has not met the criteria for an objective remission after therapy are considered to have SD. \nBecause patients with HCL are treated for specific reasons, including disease-related symptoms or decline in their \nhematologic parameters, SD is not an acceptable response.\nProgressive \ndisease (PD)Patients who have an increase in symptoms related to disease, a 25% increase in organomegaly, or a 25% decline in \ntheir hematologic parameters qualify for PD. An effort must be made to differentiate a decline in blood counts related \nto myelosuppression effects of therapy versus PD.\nHCL in relapse Morphologic relapse is defined as the reappearance of HCL in the peripheral blood, the bone marrow biopsy, or \nboth by morphologic stains in the absence of hematologic relapse. Hematologic relapse is defined as reappearance \nof cytopenia(s) below the thresholds defined above for CR and PR. Whereas no treatment is necessarily needed in \ncase of morphologic relapse, treatment decisions for a hematologic relapse are based on several parameters (eg, \nhematologic parameters warranting intervention, reoccurrence of disease-related symptoms).HCL RESPONSE CRITERIAa\na Grever MR, Abdel-Wahab O, Andritsos LA, et al.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHairy Cell Leukemia  \nMS-2 Overview \nHairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare type of indolent B -cell leukemia \ncomprising about 2% of all lymphoid leukemias.1 Leukemic cells typically \ninfiltrate the bone marrow and spleen, and may also be found in the liver, \nlymph nodes , and rarely in the skin. Small numbers of circulating hairy \ncells may be present. Clinically, HCL is characterized by symptoms of \nfatigue and weakness, and most patients will present with splenomegaly \n(symptomatic or asymptomatic) and/or hepatomegaly, pancytopenia, and \nuncommonly peripheral lymphadenopathy.2 In addition, patients may \nalso present with infection, including opportunistic  infection .  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) \nare available at www.NCCN.org .  \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines® for Hairy Cell \nLeukemia, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature in Hairy Cell Leukemia  published since the \nprevious Guidelines update. The PubMed database was chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes \npeer-reviewed biomedical literature.\n3 \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; \nGuideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta -Analysis; Systematic \nReviews; and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles selected by the panel for review during \nthe Guidelines update as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines have been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high- level evidence is \nlacking are based on the panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert \nopinion. \n \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist , and anti -weight -biased; and \ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. \nNCCN Guidelines incorporate non -gendered language, instead focusing \non organ -specific recommendations. This language is both more \naccurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of \nindividuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN \nGuidelines will continue to use the terms men , women , female, and male  \nwhen citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how \nsex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably \nor inconsistently. If sources do not diffe rentiate gender from sex \nassigned at birth or organs present, the inform ation is presumed to \npredominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages \nresearchers to collect more specific data in future studies and \norganizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their future \nanalyses.  \nDiagnosis \nMorphologic evaluation of peripheral blood smear, bone marrow biopsy \nwith or without aspirate , and adequate immunophenotyping by \nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) or flow cytometry are essential to establish \nthe diagnosis of HCL.2 Leukemic cells in HCL are small to medium in \nsize, and show a round, oval , or indented nucleus with a well -defined PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:29 PM.

The presence of a cytoplasm with prominent hair -like \nprojections of the cytoplasmic membrane is characteristic of HCL.2 \nExamination of bone marrow biopsy samples shows hairy cell infiltrates \nwith increased reticulin fibrosis, which frequently results in a “dry” tap. In \nsome patients with HCL, bone marrow may show hypocellularity . This  is \nimportant to recognize to  avoid an erroneous diagnosis of aplastic \nanemia .2 \nIn the 2017 WHO classification, classic HCL  (cHCL)  is considered as a \ndistinct clinical entity, separate from HCL variant ( HCLv ).4 In the updated \n2022 WHO classification (WHO5), HCLv  has been renamed splenic B -\ncell lymphoma/leukemia with prominent nucleoli (S BLPN) .5 The 2022 \nInternational Consensus Classification (ICC) continues to list HCLv as a \nsubtype of s plenic B -cell lymphoma/leukemia, unclassifiable.6 HCLv \n(ICC)/S BLPN (WHO5) tends to be associated with a more aggressive \ndisease course and may not respond to standard HCL therapies.7 \nTherefore, it is necessary to distinguish HCLv  (ICC)/S BLPN (WHO5)  \nfrom cHCL . \nSomatic hypermutation in  the IGHV  gene is present in the large majority \nof patients with HCL (80% –90%)8,9 The frequency of unmutated IGHV  is \nmuch lower in cHCL  than in HCLv  (ICC)/S BLPN (WHO5)  (17% vs . 54%; \nP < .001).9 About 40% of all patients diagnosed with HCLv  (ICC)/S BLPN \n(WHO5)  also express an unmutated IGHV4 -34, which typically results in \nhigher disease burden at initial diagnosis, poor response to single -agent \ntherapy , and shorter overall survival (OS).10,11 Unmutated IGHV  may \nserve as a prognostic marker for poorer outcomes with conventional \ntherapies since it is associated with primary refractoriness to purine \nanalog monotherapy , more rapid disease progression , and poor \nsurvival .12 \nThe BRAF  V600E kinase- activating mutation was identified in the \nmajority of patients with cHCL and is now regarded as the main source of pathogenesis .13-18 Additionally,  targeted sequencing has also identified \nrecurrent mutations in several other genes (eg , CDKN1B  in cHCL; \nMAP2K1  and CCND3  in HCL v).19-21 Unlike cHCL, HCLv  (ICC)/S BLPN \n(WHO5)  and B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms with a cHCL \nphenotype expressing IGHV4 -34 rearrangement lack BRAF  V600E \nmutation .11,16,22 A high frequency of MAP2K1  mutations were reported in \nHCLv (approximately 30% express a mutated MAP2K1  gene)  and in \ncHCL  with IGHV4 -34 rearrangement.23 \nImmunophenotyping is the primary methodology used to distinguish \ncHCL and HCLv  (ICC)/S BLPN (WHO5) , though the role of molecular \nanalysis is rapidly expanding.  BRAF  V600E mutation serves  as a reliable \nmolecular marker to distinguish cHCL  from HCLv  (ICC)/S BLPN (WHO5)  \nand other B -cell leukemias or lymphomas , and MAPK1 mutation analysis \nmay be useful to distinguish HCLv  (ICC)/S BLPN (WHO5)  from cHCL  in \nthe absence of BRAF  V600E mutation.11,16,23   \nIHC or flow cytometry panel for immunophenotyping should include CD5, \nCD10, CD11c, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD25, CD103, CD123, cyclin D1 , \nand CD200. The typical immunophenotype for cHCL shows CD5 -, \nCD10 -, CD11c+, CD20+(bright), CD22+, CD25+, CD103+, CD123+, \ncyclin D1+, annexin A1+ , and CD200+ (bright).16 In contrast, HCLv  \n(ICC)/S BLPN (WHO5)  is characteristically CD25 -, CD123 -, annexin A1- , \nand negative for BRAF  V600E mutation.16  \nIHC or molecular studies for BRAF  V600E mutation are useful for the \ndistinction of cHCL  from HCLv  (ICC)/S BLPN (WHO5)  and other splenic \nB-cell lymphomas.16,17,24 HCL expressing  IGHV4 -34 rearrangement  has a \nless favorable prognosis than cHCL and does not respond well to purine \nanalog- based therapy.25 Molecular analysis to identify the IGHV4 -34 \nrearrangement may be useful to distinguish cHCL from HCL with \nIGHV4 -34 rearrangement.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHairy Cell Leukemia  \nMS-4 Workup  \nThe initial workup should include a thorough physical examination with \nattention to node- bearing areas (although presence of peripheral \nlymphadenopathy is uncommon), measurement of size of liver and \nspleen , and evaluation of performance status. A bone marrow biopsy, \nwith or without aspirate, should be obtained. Laboratory assessments \nshould include complete blood count ( CBC)  with differential, \nmeasurements of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels , and a \ncomprehensive metabolic panel. Close  evaluation of renal function is \nadvised considering the renal route of drug excretion used in the \ntreatment of HCL. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing is recommended due to \nthe increased risk of viral reactivation associated with the use of \nimmunotherapy and chemotherapy. CT scans (with contrast of diagnostic \nquality) of the chest, abdomen , and/or pelvis may be useful under certain \ncircumstances.  \nTreatment Guidelines  \nThe current NCCN Guidelines apply to patients with cHCL. Regimens are \nstratified into three  categories (based on the evidence, efficacy, toxicity, \npreexisting comorbidities, and in some instances  access to certain \nagents): preferred regimens, other recommended regimens, and useful \nunder certain circumstances.  \nAt the present time, there are no established treatment options for  the \noptimal frontline or subsequent treatment  of patients with HCLv  \n(ICC)/S BLPN (WHO5) . However, cladribine  + rituximab26-28 and \nibrutinib29-31 have been shown to be effective in small cohorts of patients \nwith HCLv  (ICC)/S BLPN (WHO5) . Participation in a clinical trial and \nreferral to a medical center with expertise in the management of HCL is  \nrecommended.   Initial Treatment   \nClinical judgment is required in the decision to initiate therapy, since not all newly diagnosed patients with HCL will require immediate treatment. \nAsymptomatic disease is best managed by close observation (“watch \nand wait” approach), until indications develop.  \nIndications for treatment initiation may include symptomatic disease with excessive fatigue, physical discomfort due to splenomegaly or \nhepatomegaly, unexplained weight loss (>10% within prior 6 months), \ncytopenias (hemoglobin <11  g/dL, platelets <100,000/mcL , and/or \nabsolute neutrophil count <1000/mcL),  progressive  lymphocytosis , or \nlymphadenopathy.\n2  \nPurine Analogs ± Rituximab  \nCladribine  and pentostatin  have not been compared head to head in \nrandomized controlled trials but appear to have significant monotherapy \nactivity, resulting in durable remissions in patients with previously \nuntreated HCL.32-47  \nIn a study of 358 patients with untreated HCL, cladribine resulted in a \ncomplete response ( CR) rate of 91% with a median response duration of \n52 months and an OS rate of 96% at 48 months.35 Extended follow -up \nconfirmed the durability of responses with cladribine.38 After 7 years of \nfollow- up, of the 207 evaluable patients, 95% achieved CR and 5% \nachieved partial response (PR), with median response duration of 98 \nmonths for all patients with responding disease . The most common \ntoxicities with cladribine were grade 3– 4 neutropenia (occurring in about \n65%–85% of patients), febrile neutropenia (40%), grade 3– 4 \nthrombocytopenia (20%) , and infection (10%).  \nIn a phase III intergroup study ( 319 patients with previously untreated \nHCL randomized to pentostatin versus interferon alpha; median follow -up \nwas 57 months ), pentostatin resulted in significantly higher CR rate (76% PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:29 PM.

Survival outcomes were not significantly different between \ntreatment arms, although this analysis was complicated by the crossover \nstudy design. The most common toxicities were grade 3– 4 neutropenia \n(20%) and infections (any grade; 53%), including those requiring \nintravenous antibiotics (27%).  \nStandard -dose purine analogs should not be administered to patients \nwith active life -threatening or chronic infection. Active infection should be \ntreated prior to initiating treatment with standard- dose purine analogs. If \nit is not possible to control infection, initiating treatment with \nreduced -dose pentostatin should be considered to secure a durable \nresponse before using standard -dose purine analogs.48  \nRituximab  (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody [mAb])  in combination with \npurine analogs has also been shown to be effective in previously \nuntreated HCL ; however, it has not been evaluated extensively in this \npatient population.27 In a phase II study that included 59 patients with \npreviously untreated patients with HCL, cladribine followed by rituximab \nresulted in a CR rate of 100%.27 After a median follow -up of 60 months, \nthe 5-year failure- free survival (FFS) and OS rates were 95% and 97%, \nrespectively.  \nInitial treatment with purine analog monotherapy (cladribine or \npentostatin) or cladribine + rituximab are included as preferred treatment \noptions for untreated HCL in patients with an indication for treatment.  Routes  of Administration  of Purine Analogs    \nSubcutaneous and intravenous administration of cladribine resulted in \nsimilar response rates ; however, subcutaneous cladribine was \nassociated with a lower rate of viral infections and mucositis despite having a higher rate of neutropenia.\n49-53  \nIn a prospective study, reduced -dose subcutaneous cladribine (total \ndose of 0.5 mg/kg given as 0.1 mg/kg/d ay x 5 days)  had similar efficacy \nbut lower toxicity than standard- dose subcutaneous cladribine (total dose \nof 0.7 mg/kg; given as 0.1 mg/kg/d ay x 7 days).51 After a median \nfollow- up of 36 months, the CR rate was 64% and 73%, respectively , for \nreduced -dose and standard -dose cladribine with no difference in RFS \nand OS rates.  \nIn a retrospective analysis that compared the efficacy and safety of \nsubcutaneous and intravenous injection of cladribine in 49 patients with \nHCL (18 patients were treated with intravenous cladribine and 31 \npatients were treated with subcutaneous cladribine), the CR rate s were  \n94% and 97%, respectively, for intravenous and subcutaneous cladribine.\n52 After a median follow -up of 3 4 months, subcutaneous \ncladribine was associated with a more favorable 3 -year event -free \nsurvival  (EFS)  rate (60% and 96%, respectively; P = .104) and better \n(although non -significant) 3 -year OS rate (81% and 100%, respectively; \nP = .277). Neutropenia (grade 3 or 4; 67% vs. 87%), mucositis (grades 1 \nor 2; 67% vs . 32%) , and viral infections (78% vs. 34%) were the most \nfrequent complications in the two treatment groups, respectively.  \nA study  that evaluated the long -term outcomes of patients treated with \nsubcutaneous cladribine in three prospective multicenter clinical trials \nshowed that subcutaneous cladribine (0.14 mg/kg/day  x 5 days) was \nassociated with excellent long- term survival.53 After a median follow -up \nof 13 years, the median OS was not reached and the estimated 10- year \nand 20- year OS rates were 80% and 67%, respectively.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHairy Cell Leukemia  \nMS-6 Dosing Schedules of P urine Analogs  \nWeekly infusion of cladribine was also shown to have similar safety and \nefficacy to daily continuous infusion.54-57  \nIn a randomized study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of daily \nversus weekly infusion of cladribine (100 patients were randomized to \nreceive cladribine at standard daily dosing [0.14 mg/kg/day for 5 days] or \nonce weekly dosing [0.14 mg/kg/day once a week for 5 weeks]), the \noverall response  rate (ORR) after 10 weeks was 78% for patients who \nreceived daily dosing and 68% for those who received once weekly dosing.\n57 There were no significant differences in the toxicity profile \nbetween the two  treatment arms after 10 weeks (grade 3 or 4 \nneutropenia, 90% vs. 80%; acute infection, 44% vs. 40%; and \nerythrocyte support, 22% vs. 30%).  \nVemurafenib ± Anti -CD20 mAb  \nVemurafenib (a BRAF  V600E inhibitor with demonstrated activity in \nrelapsed/refractory HCL) was also evaluated in patients with treatment -\nnaïve HCL, either alone or in combination with anti-CD20 mA b \n(obinutuzumab or rituximab ). 58-61 \nA 2016 study assessed vemurafenib monotherapy in patients with \ntreatment -naïve HCL (21 patients were treated with vemurafenib outside \nof trials with individual dosing regimens; 240– 1920 mg/day ; median \ntreatment duration, 90 days).58 Blood count improvements were \nobserved in all patients with a CR rate of 40% (6/15 of evaluable patients) and the median EFS was 17 months. Similar response patterns \nwere achieved upon retreatment with vemurafenib (n = 6). Typical side \neffects at low dosi ng regimens included development of acute myeloid \nlymphoma (AML) subtype M6 in 1 patient, and potential disease \nacceleration triggered by vemurafenib.\n58 In a phase II multicenter trial of 30 patients with newly diagnosed HCL, \n27 patients completed 4 months of study treatment with vemurafenib + \nobinutuzumab and the CR rate was 96% at 4 months. At 10 months, with \nno further treatment, the CR rate increased to 100%.59 The most \ncommon adverse events were rash (61%; grade 1–2 14%, grade 3 46%), \narthralgia (46%; grade 1–2 36%, grade 3 11%), fatigue (29%, all g rade \n1), alopecia (25%, all grade 1), and pruritis (21%, grade 1– 2).59 \nIn another study, the combination of vemurafenib + rituximab was \nevaluated as a treatment option for treatment -naïve HCL in patients with \nsevere neutropenia, infection , and purine analogue intolerance, or as a \ntreatment option for purine analogue -resistant HCL. The combination \ntherapy was tolerable with no severe adverse events, and all patients ’ \ndisease  responded with rapid blood count recovery. However, median \nprogression- free survival (PFS) and OS were not reached at a median \nfollow- up of 18 months.60 \nThe guidelines recommend consideration of vemurafenib ± anti -CD20 \nmAb (obinutuzumab or rituximab)  as an option for initial treatment for \npatients who are unable to tolerate purine analogs including frail patients \nand those with active infection.  \nResponse Assessment  \nCR is defined as normalization  of blood counts (hemoglobin >11 g/dL \nwithout transfusion, absolute neutrophil count >1,500/mcL, platelets \n>100,000/mcL), absence of HCL cells by morphologic examination of \nbone marrow biopsy and peripheral blood sample, regression of \nsplenomegaly by physi cal examination, and absence of disease \nsymptoms.2 Available evidence suggests that achievement of CR is \nassociated with longer duration of remission.44,45 Observation until there \nis an indication for additional treatment is recommended for patients who \nachieve a CR after initial treatment with purine analog.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHairy Cell Leukemia  \nMS-7 Few studies have evaluated the clinical relevance of minimal residual \ndisease (MRD ) status in patients with disease responding to \ntherapy.27,29,59,61 -66  \nIn a phase II study that evaluated cladribine followed by rituximab in \npatients with previously untreated  or relapsed HCL, undetectable MRD  \n(uMRD)  status was achieved in 94% of patients at the end of treatment  \nbut MRD positivity during follow- up did not necessarily result in clinically \nrelevant risk for relapse.27 \nOther studies have shown that uMRD  in peripheral blood at 6 months \nafter initial treatment with purine analogs is associated with a low \nlikelihood of disease relapse.64,65 In the phase II  study that evaluated \ncladribine in combination with concurrent versus delayed rituximab in 68 \npatients with previously untreated HCL , the probability of achieving CR \nwith uMRD was higher with the use of concurrent rituximab.66 After a \nmedian follow -up of 96 months, the uMRD status (94% vs.  12%), CR \n(100% vs. 88%), and MRD -free CR rates (97% vs. 24%; P < .0001) were \nsubstantially higher with the use of concurrent rituximab versus delayed \nrituximab . In the 2021  phase II trial that assessed the safety and efficacy \nof vemurafenib plus concurrent and sequential rituximab , MRD negativity \nand no previous BRAF inhibitor treatment correlated with longer RFS in \npatients with relapsed /refractory HCL .61 Vemurafenib + obinutuzumab \nalso resulted in a uMRD of 96% in patients with newly diagnosed HCL \nand all patients remained in remission, with a median follow -up of 17 \nmonths.59 While no relapse was observed at a median follow -up of 17 \nmonths , a longer follow -up is needed to assess durability of remission  \nand relationship  between MRD status and rate of relapse.   \nIn summary , the prognostic significance of uMRD after the end of first -\nline therapy remains uncertain at this time . In contrast , a number of  \nstudies in patients with relapsed HCL have demonstrated  that CR with \nuMRD improves the  duration of response, further suggesting the utility of this approach. Thus, it has been suggested  that MRD monitoring as a \ncomponent of response assessment  should be incorporated in all clinical \ntrials for relapsed HCL .67 Moreover, f uture cooperative multicenter \nstudies will be essential to establish the value of MRD testing after the \nend of first -line therapy.67 MRD assessment is not recommended \n(outside of clinical trials) as part of response evaluation.    \nRelapsed/ Refractory or Progressive Disease  \nDabrafenib + T rametinib  \nAn open- label, phase 2 study assessed d abrafenib + trametinib  (BRAF  \nV600E inhibitors) combination therapy in  55 patients with BRAF V600E \nmutation –positive HCL refractory to first -line treatment with a purine \nanalog or disease relapse after two or more  prior lines of treatment .68 \nThe investigator -assessed ORR was 89%; CR was achieved in 66 % of \npatients  and PR in 24 %. The 24 -month PFS and OS rates were 94% and \n95%, respectively. The most common treatment -related adverse events \n(TEAEs) were pyrexia (58%), chills (47%), and hyperglycemia (40%). \nThese results are consistent with previous observations in other \nindications . Thus, d abrafenib + trametinib represents a rituximab -free \ntreatment  option for patients with relapsed/refractory BRAF  V600E \nmutation –positive HCL.68 \nVemurafenib ± Rituximab   \nVemurafenib monotherapy (960 mg twice daily) was evaluated in two \nseparate phase II multicenter studies in patients with HCL refractory to \npurine analogs or those with relapsed disease after treatment with a \npurine analog.69 In the Italian phase II multicenter trial (n  = 28), the ORR \nwas 96% (35% CR) after a median of 8 weeks of therapy , and the \nmedian RFS was longer for patients who se disease  achieved CR versus \nPR (19 months and 6 months, respectively).

Grade 1 or 2 rash and arthralgia or arthritis were the most \ncommon adverse events leading to dose reductions of vemurafenib. \nLong- term follow -up of 36 enrolled patients confirmed these findings as \nwell as the efficacy of retreatment with vemurafenib at relapse.70 After a \nmedian follow -up of 24 months, the ORR was 86% (33% CR and 53% \nPR). Among 18 patients with disease relapse, 13 received retreatment \nwith vemurafenib resulting in a PR rate of 85% with complete \nhematologic recovery.  \nVemurafenib + rituximab also induced durable responses  with uMRD in \nmost patients with relapsed/refractory HCL and the CR rates were higher \nthan that observed with vemurafenib monotherapy .61,71 In a phase II \nstudy of 30 patients with relapsed/refractory HCL, vemurafenib in \ncombination with concurrent and sequential rituximab resulted in a CR \nrate of 87%.61 After a median follow -up of 37 months, the PFS rate was \n78%. The RFS at 34 months was 85% for patients achieving a CR.61 \nIn a phase II trial of 31 patients with relapsed/refractory HCL after \ntreatment with purine analogs (25 evaluable patients), the CR rate was \n96% and t he PFS rate was 83%  after a median of 30 months of treatment  \nwith vemurafenib + rituximab.71 In addition, MRD  as measured by \nallele -specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO -PCR) was \nundetectable (10-4 sensitivity) in the bone marrow in 65% of patients. The \nmedian PFS was significantly longer ( P = .001) in patients with CR and \nuMRD (100% at a median of 31 months) than in patients with CR and \ndetectable MRD (44% at a median of 25 months).  \nA single -center , phase II , academic trial assessed the  safety and efficacy \nof vemurafenib (960 mg, twice daily for 8 weeks) in combination with \nsimultaneous and sequential rituximab (375 mg/m2, 8 doses over 18 \nweeks) in refractory or relapsed HCL and mutated BRAF  V600E in \npatients with indications for treatment (n = 30).61 Vemurafenib in combination with rituximab resulted in a CR rate of 87% ( P = .005). uMRD \nwas observed  in 65% (17 out of 26) of patients with a CR. At a median \nfollow- up of 37 months, the PFS rate was 78%  for the overall study \npopulation. The RFS rate was 85% for the 26 patients with CR , at median \nfollow- up of 34 months.61 MRD as measured by PCR for BRAF  V600E \nmutation was undetectable in the bone marrow aspirate and peripheral \nblood in 65% of patients with CR (17 of 26).  \nPurine Analog ± Rituximab  \nPentostatin and cladribine are also effective for the treatment of \nrelapsed/refractory HCL.36,39,72 In the long -term follow -up of the phase III \nrandomized study that evaluated pentostatin and interferon alpha, among the 87 patients who crossed over to pentostatin after progression \non initial interferon treatment, the 5 -year and 10 -year OS rates were 93% \nand 85%, respectively.\n36 The corresponding RFS rate s were 84% and \n69%, respectively.  \nRetreatment with the same purine analog may yield a reasonable \nduration of disease control in patients with relapsed HCL after an initial \ndurable remission to purine analog therapy.38,41,46 In the long -term \nfollow- up of a study that evaluated cladribine as initial treatment, relapse \noccurred in 37% of  patients  with an initial responding disease , with a \nmedian time to relapse of 42 months.38 Among the patients with relapsed \ndisease who received retreatment with cladribine, the CR rate after first \nrelapse was 75% (median response duration of 35 months) and the CR \nrate after subsequent relapse was 60% (median response duration of 20 \nmonths).  \nGiven the observation that retreatment with purine analogs resulted in \nshorter remission durations with each successive treatment, the use of \nrituximab in combination with purine analogs was evaluated in patients \nwith relapsed/refractory HCL.27,66,73 In a retrospective study of 18 patients \nwith previously treated HCL relapsing after purine analog monotherapy PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:40:29 PM.

In a phase II study that included 14 patients with \nrelapsed HCL, cladribine followed by rituximab resulted in a CR rate of \n100%. After a median follow -up of 60 months, the  5-year FFS and OS \nrates  were  each 100%.  \nMoxetumomab Pasudotox  \nMoxetumomab pasudotox (CD22 -directed recombinant immunotoxin) \nwas initially approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory HCL \nafter at least two prior lines of therapy in September 2018.74,75 However, \nthe manufacturer decided to permanently discontinue moxetumomab \npasudotox in the U nited States  in July 2023 due to very low clinical \nuptake since FDA approval , possibly due to the specialized complexity of \nadministration, toxicity prophylaxis, and safety monitoring needs for \npatients . Accordingly, moxetumomab pasudotox is no longer \nrecommended in the NCCN Guidelines for the treatment of relapsed or \nrefractory HCL.   \nIbrutinib  \nIbrutinib is a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor  approved for \nthe treatment of patients with CLL/SLL. In a phase II , multicenter , open -\nlabel study of 37 patients with relapsed HCL (cHCL, n = 28 ; HCLv  \n[ICC]/SBLPN [WHO5 ]), ibrutinib was evaluated at two dose levels (420 mg  \nonce daily, n =  24; and 840 mg once daily , n = 13).29 The ORR (CR and \nPR) was 24% at 32 weeks ( improved to 36% at 48 weeks ). Additionally, \nthree patients with CR had  uMRD. The ORRs  were not significantly \ndifferent between cHCL and HCLv  (ICC)/S BLPN (WHO5)  (54% and 56% \nrespectively).29 At a median follow -up of 3.5 years, the estimated 36 -\nmonth PFS and OS rates were 73% and 85%, respectively.  Diarrhea (59%), fatigue (54%), myalgia (54%), and nausea (51%) were \nthe most common grade 1– 2 nonhematologic adverse events.29 Anemia \n(5%), thrombocytopenia (22%) , and neutropenia (22%) were the most \ncommon grade ≥3 hematologic adverse events. Hypertension (11%), atrial \nflutter (3%), and heart failure (3%) were the most common grade ≥3 \ncardiovascular adverse events . There was no grade ≥3 atrial fibrillation or \nbleeding and no significant  differences in the safety profile between the \ntwo dose levels. The benefit and risk of ibrutinib should be evaluated in patients requiring anti -platelet or anticoagulant therapies.   \nZanubrutinib  \nA pooled safety analysis  evaluated zanubrutinib- associated TEAEs  and \ntreatment -limiting toxicities  in patients with relapsed/refractory or \ntreatment -naïve hematologic malignancies, including HCL (779 patients \nfrom 6 studies ; median treatment duration was 26 months ).76 Common \nnonhematologic TEAEs included upper respiratory tract infection (URI, \n39%), rash (27%), bruising (25%), musculoskeletal pain (24%), diarrhea \n(23%), cough (21%), pneumonia (21%), urinary tract infection (UTI), and \nfatigue (15% each). Atrial fibrillation and major hemorrhage were observed \nin 3% and 4% of patients, respectively. Atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and \ndiarrhea occurred at lower rates than those reported historically for \nibrutinib. Serious TEAE s included pneumonia (11%), sepsis (2%), and  \npyrexia (2%). Thirty -nine patients (4%) had fatal TEAE s, including \npneumonia (n = 9), sepsis (n = 4), unspecified cause (n = 4), and multiple \norgan dysfunction syndrome (n = 5). This analysis demonstrates that \nzanubrutinib is generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with \nknown BTK inhibitor toxicities .76 \nA phase I/II open- label study  evaluated zanubrutinib monotherapy in 12 \npatients with relapsed/refractory HCL.77 The ORR was 58% (17% CR) . \nThe median PFS and OS were not reached.

Eight (67%) patients experienced \nTEAEs of infections  (including grade 3 pneumonia and grade 3 cerebral \naspergillosis ). Five (42%) patients experienced minor hemorrhage events . \nOther TEAEs included hypertension (8%), basal cell carcinoma (17%), \ngrade 3 or 4 neutropenia (42%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and grade 3 \nanemia (8%). Thus, z anubrutinib results in clinically significant and durable \nresponses in relapsed/refractory HCL with a safety profile cons istent with \nits known safety profile in other indications.77   \nVenetoclax ± Rituximab  \nA 2023 study evaluated venetoclax ± rituximab for the treatment of \npatients with relapsed/refractory HCL.78 Out of 6 patients  who received \nvenetoclax , 2 showed CR with MRD, 1 showed PR, and 3 had a minor \nresponse, no response, or progressive disease. The main toxic effect of \nthis drug involved worsening of baseline neutropenia,  which was \nsometimes complicated by infections or febrile neutropenia. Addition of \nrituximab to the treatment regimen of 3 patients improved both the \nresponse as well as  MRD  compared to venetoclax alone.78 Another study \nassessing venetoclax monotherapy for the treatment of refractory HCL in a \nmale patient observed CR within 5 weeks of treatment initiation with a \nreduction in spleen size and number of leukemic cells in bone marrow \nover a period of 36 months and with no hematologic toxic effects .79 \nTreatment Options for Relapsed /Refractory Disease \nTreatment options for relapsed HCL depend upon the quality and \nduration of remission with initial therapy .  \nClinical trial (if available), or dabrafenib + trametinib (if not previously \ntreated with BRAF  inhibitors)68 or vemurafenib ± rituximab  (if not \npreviously given) 58,61,69,70,80  are preferred treatment options  for patients \nwith primary refractory disease (less than CR to initial treatment)  or \ndisease relapse within 2 years after achieving CR to initial therapy.  Alternat ive purine analog ± rituximab  are included as the other \nrecommended treatment options.27,36,39,66,72,73 Retreatment with the same \npurine analog or treatment with an alternative purine analog + rituximab  \nis the preferred option for patients with disease relapse after ≥2 years \nafter achieving CR to initial therapy .27,66,73 Rituximab monotherapy has \nmodest activity in patients with relapsed HCL after initial treatment with \npurine analogs,  resulting in an ORR of 25% to 80% ( 10%–53% CR), and \nthe median duration of response was 32 to 34 months .81-84 Rituximab \nmonotherapy is included as an option for patients unable to receive \npurine analogs .  \nLong- term clinical trial follow- up data suggest that interferon alpha \nresults in durable disease control and may be useful for the management \nof relapsed or refractory disease.85-87 The manufacturing of i nterferon \nalfa has been discontinued. Peginterferon alfa -2a may be substituted for \nother interferon preparations for the treatment of relapsed/refractory \ndisease.  \nTreatment Options for Progressive Disease  \nClinical trial (if available), vemurafenib (with or without rituximab) ,61,69,70 \nor dabrafenib + trametinib (if not previously treated with BRAF \ninhibitors)68 are the preferred treatment options for progressive disease \nfollowing second- line therapy .

Broad -spectrum antibacterial prophylaxis \nshould be considered for patients with neutropenia.  \nAvailable evidence suggests that the use of use granulocyte  \ncolony -stimulating factors (G -CSFs) shortens the duration of severe \nneutropenia after treatment with cladribine; however, it has no clinically \nsignificant impact on infection -related outcomes.90 The use of G -CSFs \neither as primary prophylaxis or based on the absolute neutrophil count \nhave been shown to be effective for the management of neutropenia.91 \nThe use of G -CSF might be considered in patients with severe \nneutropenic fever following chemotherapy.   \nHepatitis B Virus Reactivation  \nHBV reactivation leading to fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure,  and death \nhave been reported in patients receiving  chemotherapy and \nimmunosuppressive therapy.92 HBV prophylaxis and monitoring is \nrecommended in patients at high  risk when receiving rituximab and \npurine analogs. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) testing,  and hepatitis B e -antigen (in patients with risk \nfactors or previous history of hepatitis B) are recommended for all \npatients receiving immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy. In patients who \ntest positive for HBsAg and/or HBcAb, baseline quantitative PCR  for \nHBV DNA should be obtained to determine viral load and consultation with a gastroenterologist is recommended. A negative baseline PCR, \nhowever, does not preclude the possibility of reactivation.  \nMonitoring hepatitis B viral load with PCR monthly during treatment and \nevery 3 months thereafter is recommended. Entecavir is more effective \nthan lamivudine for the prevention of HBV reactivation associated with \nrituximab -based chemoimmunotherapy.\n93 Lamivudine prophylaxis should be avoided due to the risks for the development of resistance. Prophylactic antiviral therapy is recommended for patients who are \nHBsAg positive. Prophylactic antiviral therapy is preferred for patients \nwho are HBcAb positive. However, if there is a concur rent high -level \nhepatitis B surface antibody, these patients may be monitored for serial \nhepatitis B viral load.  \nManagement of Intolerance to anti -CD20 Monoclonal Antibody \nTherapy  \n \nRare complications such as mucocutaneous reactions including \nparaneoplastic pemphigus, Stevens -Johnson syndrome, lichenoid \ndermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis can occur in patients treated with rituximab.  Consultation with a dermatologist \nis recommended for management of these complications.  Rechallenge \nwith the same anti -CD20 mAb is not recommended in patients \nexperiencing aforementioned severe reactions . There are some data \n(based on clinical experience) showing that substitution with an alternative \nanti-CD20 mAb is tolerated in patients experiencing severe reacti ons to a \nspecific anti -CD20 mAb; however, it is unclear if such a substitution poses \nthe same risk of recurrence.\n94,95  \nRituximab and hyaluronidase human injection for subcutaneous use is \napproved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic \nleukemia, follicular lymphoma,  and diffuse large B -cell lymphoma.96-98 \nRituximab and hyaluronidase human injection for subcutaneous use may be substituted for intravenous rituximab in patients who have received at \nleast one full dose of intravenous rituximab without experiencing severe \nadverse reactions.  Switching to subcutaneous rituximab is not \nrecommended until a full intravenous dose of rituximab is successfully \nadministered  without experiencing severe adverse reactions.  A rapid \ninfusion over 90 minutes can be used if no severe infusion- related \nreactions were experienced with the prior cycle of rituximab.
