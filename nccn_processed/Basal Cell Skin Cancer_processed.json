Additional helpful features to include are immunosuppression and history of R T.\n• Pathologic report should include histologic subtypea and presence and extent of any features that would increase the risk for local \nrecurrence, including invasion of tumor beyond  reticular dermis and presence of perineural invasion.1\nPrinciples of Excision Reporting:\n• The intent of excision is to clear the tumor and thus margin status needs to be reported.\n• Saucerization specimens intended for definitive surgical therapy should be labeled as such, as they can be histopathologically difficult to \ndistinguish from shave biopsies but must be evaluated for margin status.\n• Clinical information to be submitted on excision requisition includes patient age and gender, anatomic location, clinical diameter of lesion,  \nand additional clinical information listed above under Principles of Biopsy Reporting.\n• Minimal reporting elements to be reported for all surgical specimens include histologic subtype of BCC,a invasion of tumor beyond deep \nreticular dermis, presence of perineural invasion (if involving nerve below dermis or if largest nerve involved is ≥0.1 mm in caliber) and \nangiolymphatic invasion, and peripheral and deep margin status.\n• For Mohs excisions, reporting of these elements is also encouraged. Since depth of invasion (in mm) may not be ascertained on \ntangentially cut Mohs specimens, anatomic level of invasion should be reported. Frozen or permanent section analysis of the clinical \ntumor specimen may be undertaken if needed for complete reporting of features associated with poor prognosis.2\nFootnotes\na Low-risk histologic subtypes include nodular, superficial, and other non-aggressive growth patterns such as keratotic, infundibulocystic, and fibroepithelioma of Pinkus ; \nhigh-risk subtypes include basosquamous, infiltrative, sclerosing/morpheaform, micronodular , and BCC with carcinosarcomatous differentiation.\nReferences\n1 Work Group; Invited Reviewers; Kim JYS, et al.

Complete \nmargin assessment with Mohs /PDEMA is recommended . For tumors <6 mm in size, without other high-risk features, other treatment modalities may be considered if at \nleast 4-mm clinically tumor-free margins can be obtained without significant anatomic or functional distortions.  \nc Low-risk histologic subtypes include nodular, superficial, and other non-aggressive growth patterns such as keratotic, infundibulocystic, and fibroepithelioma of Pinkus. \nd Having basosquamous, infiltrative, sclerosing/morpheaform, micronodular , and BCC with carcinosarcomatous differentiation features in any portion of the tumor.

The use of IGRT for other types of radiotherapy to treat skin cancer is considered \nunnecessary.a\n• Radiation treatments should be given by a practicing radiation oncologist with radiation physics support to meet established quality \nassurance and dosimetric constraints.\n• BED = Biologically effective dose\n• Conventionally fractionated radiotherapy consists of five daily treatments per week. \n• Hypofractionated radiotherapy consists of daily treatments or two to four treatments per week.

Locally advanced disease is defined by those that have primary or recurrent extensive \ndisease where surgery and/or RT may not result in a cure or would possibly produce a significant functional limitation.\n• Systemic therapy may be considered for cases of nodal or distant metastatic disease, especially if surgery and RT are not feasible.\n• Multidisciplinary consultation may be required to determine the best treatment approach and deem the tumor not amendable to surgery or \nRT. \n• Hedgehog pathway inhibitors (HHIs)\n\u0017Due to frequency of intolerable side effects associated with HHIs, drug holidays or other alternatives to daily dosing can be used to \nreduce side effects to improve adherence to therapy and quality of life.\n\u0017HHIs may be considered for diffuse BCC formation (eg, basal cell nevus syndrome or other genetic forms of multiple BCC). HHIs are not \nFDA approved for basal cell nevus syndrome; however, they may be used off-label and are effective based on a randomized controlled \ntrial.1\n• The role of adjuvant systemic therapy for resected BCC is unclear and thus, adjuvant systemic therapy is best performed in a clinical trial \nsetting.\nPreferred Regimens Other Recommended Regimens Useful in Certain Circumstances\nLocally Advanced Disease - \nNeoadjuvant• None • Vismodegiba,2 (category 2B) • Cemiplimab-rwlcb (category 2B)\nLocally Advanced Disease • None • Sonidegib3\n• Vismodegib4,5• Cemiplimab-rwlcb,c,6\nNodal Disease • None • Vismodegib\n• Sonidegib3 (category 2B)• Cemiplimab-rwlcb\nMetastatic Disease • None • Vismodegib4,5• Cemiplimab-rwlcb,6\na In one study of 55 patients with laBCC, neoadjuvant administration of vismodegib before planned surgery allowed for a smaller surgical procedure in \n71% of patients, although it carried a high (36.4%) recurrence risk.2 \nb Cemiplimab-rwlc is FDA approved for patients with laBCC or mBCC previously treated with an HHI or for whom an HHI is not appropriate. \nc A multinational single-arm phase 2 trial, consisting of 84 patients with locally advanced BCC (local invasion precluding complete resection or in \nlocations for which surgery may result in severe disfigurement or dysfunction) whose disease had progressed on or was intolerant to prior HHI \ntherapy, was conducted.

MS-2 \nNCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nBasal Cell Skin Cancer   \n Overview \nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cancer in the United \nStates. It is estimated that BCCs occur in 2 million Americans annuall y, \nexceeding the incidence of all other cancers combined.1-3 BCCs are at \nleast two times more common than squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), \nthe second most common type of skin cancer.1-6 Furthermore, the \nincidence of this common malignancy is rising rapidly.1,3,6,7 Compared with \nSCC, BCCs are much less likely to metastasize, with a metastatic rate of <0.1% , and thus generally have a good prognosis .\n8-10 Although rarely \nmetastatic, BCC can produce substantial local destruction along with \ndisfigurement and may involve extensive areas of soft tissue, cartilage, \nand bone.  \nA number of risk factors are associated with the development  of BCC.  The \nmost recognized environmental carcinogen is sunlight.  Evidence reveals \nthat the relationship between sun exposure and BCC is complex, and \ndepends on the timing, pattern,  and amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation.11-\n15 Fair skin, red or blond hair, and light eye color are associated with BCC \nas independent risk factors due to greater susceptibility to UV \ndamage.13,15- 22 BCC risk is increased by both UV -A and - B radiation as \nwell as by ionizing radiation. Radiation therapy (RT) for other conditions, \nespecially at a young age, is also associated with an increased risk for \ndeveloping BCC.23-27 Most BCC tumors develop on skin sites exposed to \nradiation—either from the sun or from therapy.23-25  \nGuidelines  Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update \nMethodology  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines® for Basal Cell \nSkin Cancer , an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed \nto obtain key literature  published since the previous Guidelines update, \nusing the search term s: basal cell skin carcinoma . The PubMed database \nwas chosen because it remains the most widely used resource for medical \nliterature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.28  \nThe search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase 2; Clinical Trial, Phase 3; Clinical Trial, Phase 4; \nGuideline; Meta- Analysis; Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled \nTrial; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  The data from key \nPubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines as discussed by the Panel during the \nGuidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion \nsection. Recommendations for which high -level evidence is lacking are \nbased on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion. \n \nSensitive/Inclusive Language \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.29 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  NCCN \nGuidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:39 PM.

MS-3 \nNCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nBasal Cell Skin Cancer   \n \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nGenetics  \nExtensive research has led to advances in the understanding of the \ngenetics of BCC. The sonic hedgehog signaling pathway has emerged as \nplaying a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of BCC, and mutations in a \nnumber of molecules in this pathway have been impl icated in the \ndevelopment of the disease.30-32 Mutations in the PTCH1  (patched 1) gene \non chromosome 9q, which codes for the sonic hedgehog receptor, are the \nunderlying cause of nevoid BCC syndrome, and are present in \napproximately 30% to 90% of sporadic BCCs.33-41 Specific UV -induced \nmutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 appear to be a common \nevent in BCC development.35,38,41,42 Certain genetic syndromes greatly \npredispose affected individuals to skin cancer formation, including BCC, \nsuch as albinism43,44 and xeroderma pigmentosum (in which defects exist \nin UV light -induced unscheduled DNA repair).45-51 \nClinical Presentation and Workup  \nOn clinical presentation of the patient with lesion suspicious of skin cancer , workup for BCC begins with a history and physical examination, \nbiopsy, and if applicable a shave removal . A skin biopsy is then performed \non any suspicious lesion. The biopsy should include deep reticular dermis. \nThis procedure is preferred because an infiltrative histology may \nsometimes be present only at the deeper, advancing margins of a tumor, \nand superficial biopsies will frequently miss this component.\n52,53 After BCC \ndiagnosis, a full skin examination is recommended, because  individuals with skin cancer often have additional, concurrent precancers or cancers located at other, usually sun- exposed skin sites. These individuals are \nalso at increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma.\n54  \nRisk Stratification of Local BCC Based on Risk Factors \nfor Recurrence \nAfter the complete skin examination, a risk assessment should be \nperformed to determine the treatment plan.55 The NCCN Panel examined \nrisk factors for BCC associated with recurrence  (see Risk Factors for \nRecurrence  in the algorithm ). Any high- risk factor places the skin lesion in \nthe high- risk category  and imaging should be considered if a clinical exam \nis insufficient to determine disease extent . Skin lesions in  populations \nplaced at increased  risk may be difficult to assess clinically; therefore, a \nlow threshold for performing skin biopsies in these patients is necessary. \nPatients with locally advanced disease,  which is defined as primary or \nrecurrent extensive disease where surgery and/or RT may not result in a \ncure or would potentially yield a significant functional limitation, should \nconsider imaging to determine disease extent . For rare cases when \npatients present  with regional or distant metastatic disease at diagnosis , \nimaging of areas of interest can be performed when there is suspicion of \nextensive disease prior to treatment as  nodal or distant metastases. \nImaging studies may be clinically evident when extensive disease , such as \nbone involvement, perineural invasion (PNI) , or deep soft tissue \ninvolvement , is suspected. If perineural disease is suspected, MRI with  or \nwithout  contrast is preferred.56,57 If bone disease is suspected, CT with \ncontrast is preferred unless contraindicated. Imaging modality and \ntargeted area should be at the discretion of the treating team based on the \nsuspected extent of disease ( ie, local, regional, metastatic). Histologic \nconfirmation is sufficient to diagnose local recurrence, but MRI can be considered to assess extent of local disease. For nodal or distant \nmetastases, histologic analysis and/or CT imaging can be used for \nconfirmation and to gauge the extent  of disease.

MS-4 \nNCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nBasal Cell Skin Cancer   \n \nHistory & Physical  Examination  \nLocation and Diameter  \nAnatomic location58-64 and diameter60-66 have  been known to be a risk \nfactor for BCC recurrence and metastasis for many years. Historically, \nanatomical areas have been filtered  based on the risk of recurrence for \nhigh (H -zone), medium (M -zone), and low risk (L- zone) .67-70 Based on a \n27-year retrospective review of 5755 BCCs , recurrences were significantly \nmore common when tumors in high -risk locations  (H-zone: central face, \neyebrows, nose, lips, chin, ear, temple, genitalia, nipples/areola, hands, \nfeet, ankles , and  nail units)  were ≥6 mm in diameter and when tumors in \nmoderate- risk locations ( M-zone: cheeks, forehead, scalp, neck, jawline, \npretibial surface) were ≥10 mm in diameter.71 In general, BCCs that \ndevelop in the head and neck area , which includes the H -zone of the face,  \nare more likely to recur than those that develop on the trunk and \nextremities  (L-zone) . The American Academy of Dermatology in \ncollaboration with American College of Mohs Surgery, American Society \nfor Dermatologic Surgery Association, and American Society for Mohs \nSurgery developed an appropriate use criteria document in the treatment \nof cutaneous neoplasms  based on 270 clinical scenarios including 69 \nBCCs ,72 which has been incorporated into R isk Factors for Recurrence  \nwithin the algorithm .  \nClinical Borders and Primary Versus Recurrent Disease  \nThe low- and high- risk factors of well- defined versus ill -defined clinical \ntumor borders73-75 and primary versus recurrent disease,62,74,76 \nrespectively,  have been extensively documented in the literature.   \nImmunosuppression  \nSettings of immunosuppression, such as organ transplantation,77-82 and \nlong- term use of psoralen and UVA (PUVA ) light,83,84 increase the \nincidence of BCC. In particular,  among patients who have had organ \ntransplants , BCC incidence  is approximately 5-  to 10 -fold higher than in \nthe general population,85-87 occurring in up to half of patients during the 10 years following transplant.88-91 Several large retrospective studies found \nthat BCCs in patients who had received organ transplants were more likely to have the superficial histologic subtype and to occur in extracephalic \nlocations and in younger patients (mean age of onset 15 years lower) .\n92-94 \nTwo of these studies showed similar low recurrence rates for transplant \nrecipients and controls.93,94 Nevertheless, because of NCCN Guidelines \nPanel Members’ own anecdotal experiences, the Panel decided to classify \nBCCs developing in settings of immunosuppression as potentially high- risk \ntumors.  \nSite of Prior Radiotherapy  \nTumors developing in sites of prior RT  refer to primary BCCs arising in  \nareas previously irradiated for unrelated conditions. All recurrent tumors, \nirrespective of prior therapy, are defined as high risk. Data from a number \nof studies with large sample sizes support that prior RT  for unrelated, \nfrequently benign conditions is a risk factor for BCC development.23-27,95,96  \nPathology  \nPathologic Subtypes  \nHistologic subtyping of BCC as a predictor of risk of recurrence is a well -\nestablished concept.97,98 The subtypes encompassed by the term \n“aggressive growth pattern,” including micronodular, infiltrative, sclerosing, \nand morpheaform (or desmoplastic) patterns, are  more likely to recur than \nthe nodular and superficial BCC.65,73,74,76,99 -103 Non-aggressive subtypes \ninclude the keratotic variant, infundibulocystic variant, and fibroepithelioma \nof Pinkus.  \nBasosquamous carcinomas are tumors  that have the histologic \nappearance of both a BCC and an SCC. Some basosquamous tumors are \nthe result of a BCC colliding with an adjacent SCC. Others represent truly \nbiphenotypic tumors, many of which may have started as BCC, but have \nsubsequently undergone prominent partial squamous metaplasia.104 Data PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:39 PM.

MS-5 \nNCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nBasal Cell Skin Cancer   \n \nsuggest that basosquamous carcinomas have a metastatic capacity that is \nmore similar to that of SCC than BCC.105- 107  \nPerineural Involvement  \nPNI is uncommon in any nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) (2%–6%), \nand develops less frequently and is less aggressive in BCC versus \nSCC.108-113 BCC with PNI  poses a greatly increased risk of recurrence, and \nis associated with other risk factors including previous recurrent tumors, \nhigh grade, larger lesion size, and  certain subtypes  (infiltrating, \nmorpheaform , and basosquamous ).112,114,115 If large nerve involvement is \nsuspected, MRI should be considered to evaluate extent and/or rule out \nskull involvement in those with head and neck tumors.57,116- 118 Additionally, \nin the presence of PNI, a thorough cranial nerve exam is indicated.  \nAge and  Its Effect on BCC  Behavior  \nWhether young age (typically ≤ 40 years) is an independent risk factor for \naggressive BCC behavior is debatable. An analysis of a large database of \npatients with BCC (N  = 3381) documented an increased percentage of \nBCC with aggressive histologic growth patterns in young persons.119 In \ncontrast, results from other analyses of large databases ( N = 1000 to \n>10,000) indicate that patients presenting with BCC at a young age are \nmore likely to have the superficial subtype.120- 123 Other analyses report no \nsignificant differences in BCC histologic subtype between younger  versus \nolder patients.124- 126 The relationship between tumor location and patient \nage is also unclear, as several studies showed that younger patients were \nmore likely to present with BCCs on the trunk or extremities,120,125,127,128 \nwhile another  found no significant association.124  \nMost large studies ( N = 50–2000) have shown no significant association \nbetween age and recurrence rate.62,74,124,126 One multivariate analysis, \nhowever, showed a positive relationship between increasing age and \nlikelihood of recurrence.129 Age has also been evaluated as a risk factor  \nfor developing a second or multiple BCCs  and m any of these studies us ing fairly large databases ( N = 200– 2500) found that the risk of developing \nmore than one BCC is associated with increased age.65,126,128- 134 On the \ncontrary , an analysis of a very  large database ( N = 71,924) found a \nsignificantly higher risk of subsequent NMSC in patients  <40 years of age \nat the time of their first BCC diagnosis.135 In addition, an analysis of 100 \nmetastatic BCCs found that patients with distant metastases tended to be \nyounger than those with only regional metastases.136 Consistent with this \nidea, the Rotterdam Study showed that while the risk of developing a \nsecond BCC increased with age,134 the risk of developing multiple BCC \nlesions was highest in patients who were < 65 years  of age at the time of \ntheir first BCC diagnosis.137 Taken together , these studies suggest that \nyoung age, in and of itself , is not considered a risk factor for aggressive \nBCC. Nevertheless,  there is a small subset of patients who develop BCC \nat a young age  and may have particularly aggressive disease. These \npatients  may benefit from regular follow -up. \nTreatment Modalities for BCC \nCurettage and Electrodesiccation  \nAlthough a fast and cost -effective technique for superficial lesions, \ncurettage and electrodesiccation ( C&E) does not allow histologic margin \nassessment. Studies have reported overall 5 -year recurrence rates  \nranging from  1.2% to 40% in patients with BCC selected for C&E , with \nhigh- risk locations and histologically aggressive subtypes  reporting higher \nrecurrence rates.60,69,138 -146  \nThis technique is deemed effective for properly selected, low -risk BCC \nwith three caveats.60,144 First, C&E should not be used to treat areas with \nterminal hair growth such as the scalp, pubic and axillary regions, or beard area due to the risk that a tumor extending down follicular structures might \nnot be adequately removed.  Second, if the subcutaneous layer is reached \nduring the course of C&E, then surgical removal  should generally be \nperformed instead .

MS-6 \nNCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nBasal Cell Skin Cancer   \n \neffectiveness of the C&E technique rests on the ability of the clinician to \ndistinguish between firm, normal dermis, and soft tumor tissue when using \na sharp curette. Since subcutaneous adipose is even softer than tumor \ntissue, the ability of the curette to distinguish and, therefore, selectively and completely remove tumor cells di minishes . Third, if C&E  has been \nperformed based only on the appearance of a low -risk tumor, biopsy \nresults of the tissue taken at the time of C&E  should be reviewed to make \nsure that there are no high- risk pathologic features that would require \nadditional therapy.  For tumors on the cheeks, forehead, scalp, neck, and \npretibial that are <6 mm in depth and confined to the dermis, C&E may be \nconsidered as an alternative primary treatment option if Mohs  \nmicrographic surgery or  resection wi th peripheral and deep en face margin \nassessment ( PDEMA)  and standard excision are not feasible due to \npatient comorbidities.  \nShave Removal  \nShave removal , the shaving of e pidermal or dermal lesions,  is a sharp \nremoval by bowl -shaped slicing of the  epidermal and dermal lesions , \nwithout including fat , and does not require suture closure.\n147 Like C&E , \nthere is concern for inaccurate margin status assessment  with shave \nremoval .148 However, it is a recommended technique for low -risk BCCs \nlocated in the trunk or extremities . Shave removal studies have reported \n0.5%  to 30%  rate of recurrence  over a 3 - to 5-year follow -up, multiple \ntumors treated in single  visits, and a  risk for misdiagnosis of only 1%.147- 150  \nStandard Excision with Postoperative Margin Assessment  \nAnother therapeutic option for BCC is standard surgical excision followed by postoperative pathologic evaluation of margins. This technique has \nbeen reported to achieve 5- year recurrence  rates of 0.8% to 1 7.4% for \nBCC, with lower recurrence rates associated with low -risk tumors and \nhigher recurrence rates associated with high- risk tumors .\n138,140,146,151- 153 \nStudies have reported variable margins required to completely excise 95% of all tumor.154- 159 These margins have been  suggested to be 2 to 4 mm  for \nlow-risk, well-demarcated tumors < 2 cm,154- 158 whereas margins of 4 to 6 \nmm,155 and in one study,  8 mm154 were suggested for high- risk BCC.  \nGiven this wide variability, studies have r eported incomplete excision rates \nafter standard excision ranging from 3.2% to 61.5%  depending on tumor \nlocation, histologic subtype, and medical provider’s specialty .160- 169 \nTherefore, postoperative margin assessment and identification of clear margins are critical to ensure favorable outcomes with standard excision.  \nThe clinical margins chosen by the P anel for the primary treatment of  low-\nrisk BCC are based on the work of Zitelli et al .\n170 Their analysis indicated \nthat for  well-circumscribed BCC lesions < 2 cm in diameter, excision with \n4-mm clinical margins should result in complete removal in >95% of \ncases. The indications for this approach were also expanded to include \nre-excision of low -risk primary BCC if positive margins are obtained after \nan initial excision with postoperative margin assessment.  For high -risk \nBCC, standard excision with wider surgical margins is recommended  as \nthe primary treatment . Due to the wide variability of clini cal characteristics \nthat may define a high- risk tumor, it is not feasible to recommend a \ndefined margin for standard excision of high -risk BCC. Kean awareness of \nthe subclinical extension of BCC is advised when selecting a treatment \nmodality without complete margin assessment for a high- risk tumor. These \nmargins may need to be modified based on tumor - or patient -specific \nfactors.  When standard excision with wider surgical margins yields positive \nmargins , Mohs or other forms of PDEMA  or standard re- excision are \nrecommended (if PDEMA is not feasible).  \nFor either low -risk or high -risk BCC, when  standard excision is used, \ntissue rearrangement ( eg, flap reconstruction, extensive undermining) \nshould not be undertaken until clear margins are identified.  Second,  \nintention healing, linear repair, or skin graft are acceptable options.

MS-7 \nNCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nBasal Cell Skin Cancer   \n \nMohs Micrographic Surgery and Peripheral and Deep En Face \nMargin Assessment   \nPDEMA, or complete margin assessment, is a term used for a subset of \nsurgical techniques for high- quality histologic visualization and \ninterpretation of the margin surface or surgically excised tissue. Mohs \nmicrographic surgery is the most common utilized PDEMA technique. \nMohs procedures are particularly successful in non- metastatic basal and \nsquamous cell skin cancers where tissue -sparing and precision \nmicroscopic control of margins is a priority  and has been associated with \nlower recurrence rates .171,172 While PDEMA is a team procedure that \nrequires the participation  of physicians from multi ple disciplin es, Mohs \nphysicians serve as both the surgeon and pathologist  requiring highly  \nspecialized training. Efforts have been extended to generate consensus \nrecommendations to offer Mohs surgeons guidance and promote \nstandardization to make data aggregate from multicenter clinical trials \npossible.173  \nMohs  is the preferred surgical technique over standard excision for re-\nexcision of low -risk BCC after positive margins with standard excision, as \nwell as the primary surgical technique of choice for high- risk BCC because \nit allows intraoperative analysis of 100% of the excision margin. Mohs is \nalso recommended when standard excision with wider surgical margins is \nunable to achieve negative margins in high -risk BCC.  Two meta -analyses \npublished in 1989 associated Mohs  with 5 -year recurrence rates  of 1.0% \nfor primary BCC, and 5.6% for recurrent BCC.138,146 In these studies,  the \nrecurrence rate s for Mohs  were lower than those for standard excision \n(10.1% and 17.4% for primary and recurrent BCC, respectively), and lower \nthan those for any other treatment modality included in the analysis ( C&E, \ncryotherapy, and RT).138,146 Studies on the long- term outcomes (~4 years) \nof Mohs have reported overall recurrence rates of 2.9 % to 3.8%,174,175 \nspecifically 0 % to 6.5% for primary and 4% to 20% for recurrent \nBCCs.98,176 -181  A prospective randomized trial comparing M ohs to standard excision \nreported fewer  10-year recurrences with Mohs  for both primary (2.5% vs . \n4.1%; P = .397) and recurrent BCC (2.4% vs . 12.1%; P = .015), although \nthe difference was only statistically significant for recurrent tumors. Importantly, a large proportion of recurrences occurred more than 5  years \nafter treatment.69,182,183 It has been demonstrated that H-zone location, \nrecurrent tumor, aggressive subtype , PNI, and tumor size ≥11 mm are \nsignificantly associated with two or more Mohs stages .114,184 However, \nsuperficial BCC, despite being generally considered less aggressive, was  \nshown in a B razilian study to be 9 .03 times more likely to require more \nthan one Mohs stage, likely due to “skip areas” and clinically indistinct \nborders.185 \nExcision with PDEMA with permanent section analysis or intraoperative \nfrozen section analysis  is an acceptable alternative to M ohs provided it \nincludes a complete assessment of all deep and peripheral margins.  A 5-\nyear recurrence rate of 0.58% has been reported with slow Mohs  using \nformalin -fixed paraffin- embedded sections and delayed closure in a UK -\nbased prospective study.186 The descriptive term PDEMA underscores the \nPanel’s belief that complete histologic assessment of the entire marginal \nsurface is the key to optimal tumor removal . For more information, refer to \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Squamous Cell Skin Cancer  SCC- G Principles of \nPDEMA Technique.  \nRadiation Therapy  \nAlthough surgery is the mainstay of local treatment for BCC, consideration of function and patient preference and other factors may lead to the choice \nof RT as primary therapy  for non-surgical candidates for  both low -risk and \nhigh- risk as well as patient with  advanced  BCC (locally advanced, nodal, \nand m etastatic BCC) .\n187 The appropriateness of RT should be determined \nby a radiation oncologist  with radiation physics support to meet \nestablished quality assurance and dosimetric constraints .

Adjuvant RT is also a \nrecommended  treatment option when resection is not feasible for high- risk \nBCC after negative margins in case of extensive perineural or large- nerve \ninvolvement.188 In these patients, local control has been reported to be \n50% to 90% with postoperative RT .187,189 There are conflicting data about \nthe value of adjuvant RT following margin- negative surgical excision, \nparticularly after Mohs.  For patients with locally advanced BCC (laBCC) or \nmetastatic disease, RT is recommended as an option for primary \ntreatment. RT is also a primary treatment option in instances where \nsurgery is not feasible or as an adjuvant RT combination with surgery .  \nTwo meta- analyses reported 5- year recurrence rates of 8.7% and 9.8% \nafter RT on primary and recurrent BCC, respectively.138,146 Retrospective \nanalyses of BCC treated with RT have reported 5- year local control, cure, \nor complete response rates ranging from 93% to 96%,190- 193 and 5- year \nrecurrence rates from 4%  to 16%.194- 196 Efficacy of RT was better for BCCs \nthat were less advanced, primary (vs. recurrent) , or had smaller diameter \nor nodular histologic subtype.190,191,193- 195 A prospective study randomiz ing \n347 patients to receive either surgery (standard excision with free margins \n≥2 mm from visible borders) or RT as primary treatment of BC C reported \nhigher  recurrence rates with RT than surgery (7.5% vs. 0.7%; P  = .003),197 \npoorer cosmetic outcomes, and more postoperative complications.198  \nA small number of prospective studies have  reported high rates of tumor \ncontrol with specific radiation dose fractionation regimens for small BCCs.\n197,199,200 A systematic review and meta -analysis also reported \nhypofractionated RT regimens associated with positive cosmetic outcomes.\n201 The NCCN Panel recommends ranges of electron beam \ndose for regional disease and fractionation that can be used for definite \nRT and postoperative adjuvant RT. For general dosing recommendations, refer to the ASTRO Guideline on Definitive and P ostoperative Radiation \nTherapy for Basal and Squamous Cell Cancers of the Skin.202  \nIsotope -based brachytherapy can be an effective treatment for certain \nsites of disease, particularly on the head and neck.203- 206 Image- guided \nradiation therapy (IGRT) is considered best practice when treating with \nintensity -modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), proton beam radiotherapy, \nor 3-D conformal radiation.207- 209 The use of IGRT for other types of \nradiotherapy to treat skin cancer is considered unnecessary.  \nHowever, there is insufficient long- term efficacy and safety data to support \nthe routine use of electronic surface brachytherapy.210,211 Electronic \nbrachytherapy (EB) uses electrically generated X -rays, which are not \nregulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. One of the apparent advantages of EB devices is the decreased shielding requirements and \nthe portability of the units, however, this may lead to EB use in settings \nunfamiliar with the hazards of therapeutic radiation delivery.\n212 The \nAmerican Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) task group 152 \nhas provided guidelines for proper and safe EB use including having an \nauthorized medical physicist (AMP) physically present from the initiation \nthrough the duration of all treatments involving an EB unit.  The AMP is \nresponsible for output calibration, quality assurance, training and treatment planning.\n212 Furthermore, training and educational requirements \nfor those administering EB vary considerably from state to state, and users should consult their local radiation safety committee to confirm appropriate \ncompliance. The American Brachytherapy Society (ABS ) has published a \nconsensus statement for electronic brachytherapy, noting a paucity of long- term clinical outcome data and lack of comparison to surgery or \nstandard radiotherapy techniques.\n213 Particularly concerning is the \nabsence of standardized dosimetry (in comparison to high dose rate \n[HDR]  brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy) to ensure adequate \ntarget coverage, skin surface dose, and plan quality assurance. The ABS, therefore, recommends that “EB treatment should be performed on clinical PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:39 PM.

The American Academy of Dermatology \n(AAD) has published a Position Statement : “The AAD believes additional \nresearch is needed on electronic surface brachytherapy particularly on long- term outcomes”. The AAD acknowledges concerns regarding \naggressive marketing to dermatologists with a focus on revenue streams, \npotentially undermining quality of care and patient safety. The AAD also \ncautions dermatologists to be mindful of the Stark phys ician self -referral \nlaw. Recently, image guidance CPT codes have been used for the delivery \nof EB, despite a lack of evidence demonstrating a benefit in clinical \noutcomes with image guidance. We do not support the use of image \nguidance with EB current ly. In conclusion, EB should only be performed by \nRadiation Oncologists with Medical Physics support, on registry or clinical \ntrial, with appropriate safeguards, and in adherence with all State and \nFederal regulations. Further research is needed regarding dose deposition \nand long- term clinical outcomes.  \nSuperficial Therapies  \nIn patients with superficial BCC, therapies such as topical imiquimod, topical 5 -fluorouracil  (5-FU), or photodynamic therapy  (PDT)  may be \nconsidered, although cure rates are approximately 10% lower than for \nsurgical treatment modalities.\n214- 216 Another option for patients with \nsuperficial BCC is cryotherapy.217 These options are also recommended \nfor pa tients where surgery or RT is contraindicated or impractical  and are \nconsidered as useful in certain circumstances .  \nTopical Therapies  \nImiquimod was found to be effective for treating  nodular and superficial  \nBCC in randomized studies.218- 223 Two 5- year follow -up studies  reported \noverall treatment success rates of 80.4% and 77.9%, respectively , in \npatients with superficial BCC treated with imiquimod .222,224 Recurrence \nseems to be associated with tumor thickness.225 A phase III randomized \ntrial in patients with superficial or nodular BCC showed that imiquimod provided an 82.5 % clinical success rate .226,227 For all of these studies, \ntumors in the H -zone were excluded. Although the clinical success rate \nwas significantly higher with surgical excision using a 4 -mm margin \n(97.7%; P < .001), cosmetic outcomes by dermatologi c assessment were \nsignificantly better with imiquimod (excellent/good at 3- year follow -up: 61% \nvs. 36%; P < .001). Another topical cream with efficacy against BCC is  5-\nFU,228,229 which has been shown in a large randomized trial to have a 5 -\nyear tumor -free survival probability of 70.0% .215,230,231 Other studies have \nreported cure rates of up to 90% with this treatment.232- 234 \nPhotodynamic Therapy  \nPDT with p hotosensitizing agents including 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)  \nand porfimer sodium  is another option for superficial BCC .235- 237 Multiple \nrandomized trials and a meta -analys is have shown that rates of excellent \nor good cosmetic outcomes were higher with PDT versus surgery, \nalthough surgery was superior to PDT in terms of disease control .152,238 -245 \nData from  clinical trials reported cure rates from 60% to 100% by PDT for \npatients with BCC.241,246- 251 Most of these  studies have focused on the \nsuperficial and nodular histologic subtypes, and several have found higher \ncure rates for superficial versus nodular subtypes  in both low - and high-\nrisk locations .241,246,251 Ulceration and thickness are associated with lower \nresponse to therapy,251 and within the nodular subtype, cure rates are \nbetter with thinner lesions.240 Clinical studies have demonstrated PDT \nactivity against “difficult -to-treat” lesions, with a 24-month complete \nresponse rate of 78%.246,252 Currently, PDT is being used at some NCCN \nMember Institutions for premalignant or superficial low -risk lesions on any \nlocation on the body, although response rates may be higher on the face \nand scalp.253,254  \nCryo therapy  \nCryo therapy  has been used for many years as a fast and cost -effective \nmeans for removal of BCCs .217 Systematic reviews of historical data in \nprimary BCCs have reported recurrence rates for cryotherapy ranging PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:39 PM.

MS-10 \nNCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nBasal Cell Skin Cancer   \n \nfrom 0 % to 13%, and mean recurrence rates from pooled analyses \nranging between 3% and 4%.138,140,255,256 In prospective trials, cry otherapy  \nhas been shown to result in  recurrence rates ranging from 5% to \n39%.199,257- 259 Current guidelines for low -risk BCC,  which include \nsuperficial BCC,  recommend several treatment options such as \ncryosurgery with or without prior curettage or C&E .217 A key limitation of \ncryotherapy is poorer cosmetic outcomes compared with other treatment \noptions, as demonstrated by prospective randomized trials.258- 260  \nComparisons of Superficial Therapies  \nSeveral randomized studies and meta -analyses have compared superficial \ntherapies for BCC (Table 1). In summary , these studies indicate that in \npatients with superficial BCC,  PDT has similar efficacy as cryotherapy but \nmuch better cosmetic outcomes . Whereas a meta- analysis of 23 \nrandomized and non -randomized trials found no significant difference in \nefficacy for PDT versus imiquimod,261 a randomized tr ial showed that \ntreatment success was more likely with imiquimod.215,231 This study also \ndemonstrate s superior imiquimod outcomes compared to 5 -FU cream. \nExploratory subanalyses  found that treatment success rates were \nsignificantly higher with imiquimod for tumors that are large or truncal, \nwhile PDT provided significantly better outcomes in patients who are older  \nwith lesions on the lower extremities.262 Safety results showed that while  \nPDT causes moderate to severe pain during treatment administration, \nimiquimod and 5 -FU are more likely to cause moderate to severe local \nswelling, erosion, crust formation, itching, and wound infections.230 Both \ncryotherapy  and PDT are associated with pain during and after treatment, \nand data from a randomized trial indicate a trend toward a higher likelihood of pain with PDT.\n258 \nNicotinamide in Reducing BCC Development  \nData from phase II and phase III randomized trials indicated that treatment \nof actinic keratoses with nicotinamide reduced the occurrence of new \nBCCs, specifically by 20% at 12 -month follow -up.263,264 A systemic review and meta- analysis of randomized controlled trials determined that there \nwas a significant association between nicotinamide and a reduction in \nBCCs and SCCs  with a noted increased risk for digestive adverse \nevents.265 On the other hand, a phase III trial in recipients of organ  \ntransplant s found no significant difference in the prevalence of SCC, BCC, \nor actinic keratosis between the groups randomly assigned to nicotinamide \nor placebo.266 Other agents that might be effective for the prevention of \nBCC in individuals at high risk for developing NMSCs include celecoxib,267 \nacitretin,268 capecitabine,269 and tazarotene.270 \nSystemic Therapy  \nFor advanced  BCC, s ystemic therapy  is recommended as a treatment \noption for laBCC, metastatic (mBCC), and nodal BCC after \nmultidisciplinary consultation. Other options include surgery, RT, and \npalliation and best supportive care for certain patients. The systemic \ntherapy options for BCC include hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI) and \nimmunotherapy. Vismodegib and cemiplimab are currently recommended \noptions for all advanced BCC s while sonidegib is only recommended for \nnodal and laBCC.  \nHedgehog Pathway Inhibitors  \nVismodegib is an HHI approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) for the treatment of adults with laBCC or mBCC  that has recurred \nfollowing surgery, or those who are not candidates for surgery or RT.271 \nThe 9-month follow -up data from the SHH4476g trial, a  centrally reported , \nmulticenter , phase I , open- label  study  had an initial enrollment of 104 \npatients (laBCC N = 71, mBCC N = 33) ; however, pathology results \nexcluded eight laBCC patients from the efficacy analysis ( N = 63). This \ntrial reported an objective response rate of 30% in the mBCC group and \n43% in the laBCC group , with a median duration of response (DOR)  of 7.6 \nmonths and 9.5 -month median progression- free survival  (PFS) .272 A 39-\nmonth  follow- up to these data from the ERIVANCE trial, a n investigator -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:39 PM.

MS-11 \nNCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nBasal Cell Skin Cancer   \n \nreported,  multicenter , phase II trial , conveyed  an objective response rate  \nof 48.5%  in the mBCC group and 60.3% in the laBCC group, with a \nmedian DOR  of 14.8 months and 26.2 months for each group, \nrespectively .272- 275 Results from these trials for vismodegib in BCC are \nsummarized in Table 2. According to these data, nearly all patients treated \nwith vismodegib experienced at least one treatment -emergent adverse \nevent ( TEAE), but a significant proportion of these were low grade (grade \n≤2).272- 274 Serious adverse events (SAEs)  occurred in 25%  to 32% of \npatients in these studies. The most common adverse events ( AEs) \nincluded  muscle spasms, alopecia, taste loss, weight loss, decreased \nappetite, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.  \nVismodegib has also been tested as BCC treatment and prophylaxis in \npatients with nevoid BCC syndrome. A randomized phase II study in \npatients with nevoid BCC syndrome and at least 10 operable BCC lesions \nfound that vismodegib significantly reduced incidence of new BCC lesions \ncompared with placebo, and also significantly reduced the size of existing \nlesions and the number of surgeries needed to remove BCC lesions.276- 278 \nSonidegib is another HHI FDA-approved  agent for the treatment of \npatients with l aBCC that has recurred following surgery or RT, or who are \nnot candidates for surgery or RT .271 Sonidegib is FDA approved for la BCC.  \nThe 42-month  follow- up data from the centrally  reported  randomized,  \nmulticenter , phase II BOLT trial reported similar objective response rates  \nfor the 200- mg and 800-mg doses tested among patients with laBCC  (56% \nand 46%, respectively) , while there was a 2 -fold difference for  patients \nwith mBCC (8% and 17%, respectively) .279- 283 This trial also reported, for \neach dose and patient group, median DOR  and PFS results that are \nsummarized in Table 2. The 30- month investigator -reviewed data for the \nBOLT trial analyzing only the 200- mg dose showed a higher objective \nresponse rate  of 71.2% for laBCC and 23.1% for mBCC ( Table 2).281,284 \nAs with vismodegib, nearly all patients experienced at least one AE, and \nthe most common AEs were muscle spasms, dysgeusia, alopecia, nausea, weight decrease,  and fatigue. Elevated creatinine kinase was also \nfrequently observed and  was one of the most common grade 3– 4 AEs, \nalong with elevated lipase.   \nA key limitation to HHI  therapies is that advanced BCC can develop \nresistance, which limits DOR. A small investigator -initiated trial in patients \nwith vismodegib- resistant advanced BCC observed no responses during \ntreatment with sonidegib for a median of 6 weeks (range , 3–58 weeks), \nand in 5 of 9 patients with disease progression .285  \nOngoing clinical research is exploring various dosing regimens of \nvismodegib and sonidegib in a variety of BCC treatment settings, including \nin the neoadjuvant setting, in patients with multiple BCCs  or with radiation-\ninduced multiple BCCs of the scalp , and as maintenance therapy after \nlaBCC complete remission.286- 291 \nNotably, in the neoadjuvant setting, while one trial reported negative \nresults (unmet predefined complete histologic clearance rate ),287 results \nfrom two studies indicated vismodegib may reduce surgical defect area and allow for downstaging of the surgical procedure for laBCCs in \nfunctionally sensitive locations.\n286,289 Vismodegib neoadjuvant efficacy and \nsafety was evaluated in the multicenter, open -label, phase II VISMONEO \nstudy, 55 patients were enrolled and 80% (N = 44) presented with \ndownstaging after a mean 6 -month treatment duration.289 This study \nreported an objective response rate of 71%, with 36% recurrence at the 3-year follow -up.\n289 Additionally, a new surgical classification was presented \nin this publication according to morbidity where six predetermined stages \n(stage A –F) were used to determine the surgical procedure complexity  \nwith details for each area of the face .289 Some of these studies included \nsmall number s of patients, and thus their results need to be carefully \ninterpreted.

MS-12 \nNCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025  \nBasal Cell Skin Cancer   \n \nOther HHIs  are also being tested in patients with BCC to see if they can \nprovide higher rates of response, more durable responses, responses in \nless advanced BCC , or responses in BCC resistant to vismodegib. Results \nfrom phase I –II trials with small BCC sample sizes (N < 40) have shown \nthat itraconazole and saridegib can elicit responses in patients with BCC, \nalthough not in patients who previously received vismodegib.292,293 \nImmunotherapy  \nCemiplimab -rwlc is an anti- programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) \nimmunotherapy FDA -approved for patients with laBCC or mBCC \npreviously  treated with an HHI or for whom an HHI is not appropriate.271 \nCemiplimab is a recommended treatment option for certain patients with advanced BCC including in the neoadjuvant setting for laBCC. A  centrally  \nreported,  multicenter , phase II, open- label  trial test ed cemiplimab -rwlc (N  \n= 84) for patient s with laBCC where local invasion precluding complete \nresection or in locations for which surgery may result in sever \ndisfigurement or dysfunction and whose disease has progressed on or \nwas intolerant to prior HHI therapy.294 This study reported a median follow -\nup of 15 months , objective response rate  of 31% , and grade 3– 4 TEAEs in \n48% of patients , while  SAEs occurred in 35% of patients.294  \nDue to the rarity of advanced BCC cases, the literature on chemotherapy \nfor BCC is limited to case reports.295- 301 \nFollow- up \nFollow -up for BCC should include a history and physical  examination , \nalong with a complete  skin exam ination every 6  to 12 months for the first 5 \nyears, and then at least annually for life. Imaging may be considered if clinical exam ination is insufficient for following the disease. Follow -up with \na dermatologist is strongly recommended if any of the following criteria are met: past or imminent solid organ, marrow, or hematopoietic cell \ntransplant; one or more cutaneous melanomas in the past 5 years; or four \nor more NMSCs  within the past 5 years.  \nImaging modality and targeted area should be at the discretion of the \ntreating team based on the suspected extent of disease ( ie, local, regional, \nmetastatic). Histologic confirmation is sufficient to diagnose local \nrecurrence, but imaging can be considered to assess extent of disease. As \npart of follow -up, the patients should be educated on sun protection and \nself-examination. For local recurrence, the primary treatment pathway for \nhigh- risk BCC should be followed. For locally advanced,  nodal \nmetastases,  and distant metastases , the appropriate path should be \nfollowed as found within Advanced BCC  in the algorithm  with a \nconsideration for multidisciplinary discussion and multimodality treatments . \nAn estimated 30% to 50% of patients with BCC will develop another BCC \nwithin 5 years.\n130,133,302 -305 This represents a 10 -fold increase in risk \ncompared to the general population.303 Patients with a prior BCC are also \nat increased risk of developing SCC and cutaneous melanoma.130,305 A \nprospective population- based cohort study found that development of a \nsecond BCC is most likely during the short -term follow -up period after \ndiagnosis of the first lesion.137 Therefore, close foll ow-up of patients with \nBCC in both the short - and long- term is critical.  \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:39 PM.
