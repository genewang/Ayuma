The \ninformation below provides details regarding simulation, target volume definition, dose prescription, organs at risk (OAR), IMRT constraints, \nquality assurance, and image guidance delivery.\n• Image-guided RT (IGRT) with kilovoltage (kV) imaging or cone beam CT imaging should be routinely used during the course of treatment \nwith IMRT and stereotactic body RT (SBRT).\n• Consider SBRT for patients with oligometastatic disease.\nTreatment Information\n• Simulation\n\u0017After clinical and radiologic staging, CT-based simulation is performed for radiation treatment planning. If available, FDG-PET/CT, MRI \npelvis, or FDG-PET/MRI (if available) at the time of simulation may be helpful to define local and regional target structures. Patients can \nbe simulated in the supine or prone position and there are benefits to each approach in the appropriate clinical setting. Prone setup \nwith a false tabletop allows for improved small bowel avoidance and may be useful in individuals with a large pannus and pelvic node \ninvolvement. Supine setup is usually more reproducible with less setup variability, potentially allowing for reduced planning target volume \n(PTV) margins and smaller treatment fields. Patients are typically simulated for anal cancer IMRT planning in the supine position with legs \nslightly abducted (frog-legged) with semi-rigid immobilization in vacuum-locked bag or alpha-cradle. Patients are instructed to maintain a \nfull bladder for simulation and treatment.\n\u0017In males,* the external genitalia are typically positioned inferiorly such that setup is reproducible. In females,* a vaginal dilator can be \nplaced to help delineate the genitalia and move the vulva and lower vagina away from the primary tumor. A radiopaque marker should be \nplaced at the anal verge and perianal skin involvement can be outlined with radio-opaque catheters. It may be helpful to place a catheter \nwith rectal contrast in the anal canal at the time of simulation for tumor delineation. \n\u0017In patients with adequate renal function, IV contrast facilitates identification of the pelvic and groin vasculature (which approximates at-risk \nnodal regions). Oral contrast identifies small bowel as an avoidance structure during treatment planning. For tumors involving the perianal \nskin or superficial inguinal nodes, bolus should be placed as necessary for adequate dosing of gross disease in these areas. Routine \nuse of bolus may not be necessary as the tangential effect of IMRT may minimize skin sparing. In situations where adequate dosing of \nsuperficial targets is uncertain, in vivo diode dosimetry with the first treatment fraction can ensure appropriate dose at the skin surface. \n1 Ajani JA, Winter KA, Gunderson LL, et al.

Gross tumor volume (GTV) should include all primary \ntumor and involved lymph nodes, using information from physical examination, endoscopic findings, diagnostic imaging, and simulation \nplanning study for delineation. CTV should include the GTV plus areas at risk for microscopic spread from the primary tumor and at-risk \nnodal areas. If the primary tumor cannot be determined with available information (such as after local excision), the anal canal may be used \nas a surrogate target.\n\u0017The pelvic and inguinal nodes should be routinely treated in all patients.  \n\u0017When using IMRT, a separate CTV volume for each planned treatment dose tier is contoured. One approach has been to define three tiers: \na gross disease only volume, a high-risk elective nodal volume (including gross disease), and low-risk elective nodal volume (including \ngross disease). These volumes are determined by the presence or absence of tumor based on physical examination, biopsy, diagnostic \nand planning studies, and risk of nodal spread depending on tumor stage at presentation. The rationale for this approach is based on the \nshrinking fields technique. In RTOG-0529, a gross disease volume with a single elective nodal volume are used to deliver the prescribed \ncourse (dose-painting). \n\u0017In defining the gross disease CTV around the primary tumor, an approximately 1- to 2-cm margin around GTV should be used with \nmanual editing to avoid muscle or bone at low risk for tumor infiltration. T o define the gross disease CTV around involved nodes, a 0.5- to \n1-cm expansion should be made beyond the contoured involved lymph node with manual editing to exclude areas at low risk for tumor \ninfiltration. \n\u0017At-risk nodal regions include mesorectal, presacral, internal and external iliac, and inguinal nodes. The mesorectal volume encompasses \nthe rectum and surrounding lymphatic tissue. The presacral nodal volume is typically defined as an approximately 1-cm strip over the \nanterior sacral prominence. To contour the internal and external iliac nodes, it is recommended to generally contour the iliac arteries \nand veins with approximately 0.7-cm margin (1- to 1.5-cm anteriorly on external iliac vessels) to include adjacent lymph nodes. In order \nto include the obturator lymph nodes, external and internal iliac volume contours should be joined parallel to the pelvic sidewall. The \ninguinal node volume extends beyond the external iliac contour along the femoral artery from approximately the upper edge of the superior \npubic rami to approximately 2 cm caudad to saphenous/femoral artery junction. The inguinal node volume should be contoured as a \ncompartment with general margins. The medial and lateral borders may be defined by adductor longus and sartorius muscles, respectively . \nSeveral recently published atlases are helpful to review when defining elective nodal CTVs.5,6 The above descriptions are generalizations \nand each plan should be individualized based on the anatomy of each patient and tumor distribution. \nContinued1 Ajani JA, Winter KA, Gunderson LL, et al.

In patients with gross inguinal nodal involvement, the bilateral or \nunilateral inguinal nodes may be included in the high-risk elective nodal volume. The low-risk elective nodal volume should include the \ngross disease CTV, high-risk elective nodal CTV, and presacral, bilateral internal, and external iliac nodes above the inferior border of the \nsacroiliac joint to the bifurcation of the internal and external iliac vessels at approximately L5/S1 vertebral body junction. If there is no \nobvious involvement of the bilateral inguinal nodes, these are included in the low-risk elective nodal volume. \n\u0017PTV should account for effects of organ and patient movement and inaccuracies in beam and patient setup. PTV expansions should \ntypically be approximately 0.5- to 1.0-cm depending on use of image guidance and physician practice with treatment setup for each \ndefined CTV. To account for differences in bladder and rectal filling, a more generous CTV to PTV margin is applied in these regions. These \nvolumes may be manually edited to limit the borders to the skin surface for treatment planning purposes.  \n• Dose Prescription\n\u0017With IMRT treatment planning, doses are typically prescribed to PTVs. The dose of radiation required to control disease is extrapolated \nfrom historical studies that show excellent rates of control with concurrent radiation and chemotherapy. Typically prescribed dose varies \nby size of the tumor and risk of microscopic spread in elective nodal areas. One approach with “shrinking field technique” is that the low-\nrisk elective nodal PTV volume is typically prescribed to 30.6 Gy in 1.8 Gy daily fractions. The high-risk elective nodal PTV is sequentially \nprescribed an additional 14.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy daily fractions for a total prescribed dose of 45 Gy. Finally, for T1–2 lesions with residual disease \nafter 45 Gy, T3–4 lesions, or N1 lesions, an additional 5.4–14.4 Gy in 1.8–2 Gy daily fractions is again sequentially prescribed to the gross \ndisease PTV volume (total dose, 50.4–59.4 Gy).\n\u0017In RTOG-0529, the prescription parameters are different due to the use of only a single elective nodal volume and slightly different dose \nprescriptions depending on tumor stage. Furthermore, delivery of escalating dose to different target volumes was performed using a \nsimultaneous integrated boost (SIB) dose painting technique with a maximum dose of 1.8 Gy per fraction to the primary tumor and large \nvolume gross nodal involvement and 1.5 Gy per daily fraction to elective nodal areas. Table 1 outlines dose prescriptions by TNM stage \naccording to the RTOG-0529 protocol. The SIB approach offers the convenience of developing a single treatment plan with reduced \nplanning complexity, albeit with a lower biological dose delivered to the elective nodal areas.\n\u0017For patients untreated presenting with synchronous local and metastatic disease, a platinum-based regimen is standard practice, and \nradiation can be considered for local control. The approach to radiation depends on the patient’s performance status and extent of metastatic \ndisease. If performance status is good and metastatic disease is limited, treat involved fields, 45–54 Gy to the primary tumor and involved \nsites in the pelvis, in coordination with plans for a platinum-based regimen. If there is low-volume liver oligometastasis, an SBRT dosing \nschema after systemic therapy may be appropriate depending on response. If metastatic disease is extensive and life expectancy is limited, \na different schedule and dose of radiation should be considered, again in coordination with plans for 5-FU/cisplatin or a platinum-based \nregimen. \nContinued1 Ajani JA, Winter KA, Gunderson LL, et al.

In this setting, \nsurgery should be performed if possible, and, if not, palliative RT and chemotherapy can be considered based on symptoms, extent of \nrecurrence, and prior treatment. RT technique and doses are dependent on dosing and technique of prior treatment. In the setting of pure \npalliation, doses of 20–25 Gy in 5 fractions to 30 Gy in 10 fractions can be considered. SBRT can also be considered for treatment of \nprimary and nodal recurrence in the setting of low-volume metastatic disease.\n• OARs and IMRT Constraints\n\u0017It is important to accurately define OARs so that dose to these structures can be minimized during treatment. In anal cancer , 2D and 3D \ntreatment planning techniques are limited in their ability to spare most pelvic normal tissues due to the location of the target. W ith IMRT, \ndose to small bowel, bladder, pelvic/femoral bones, and external genitalia can be sculpted and minimized despite close proximity of these \norgans to target volumes. When contouring these structures, it is typically best to demarcate normal tissues on axial CT at least 2 cm \nabove and below the PTV. Oral contrast is helpful to delineate the small bowel. While there is significant variability in how to contour the \nsmall bowel, one approach entails contouring the entire volume of peritoneal space in which the small bowel can move. As with elective \nnodal volume delineation, contouring atlases offer excellent guidance on defining OARs.7 Once the OARs have been identified, the chief \naim of IMRT planning is to limit the dose to these structures without compromising PTV coverage. The extent to which OARs can be \navoided largely depends on the location and extent of tumor involvement at presentation as well as the extent to which the bowel extends \ninto the lower pelvis and a given individual’s anatomy.\n\u0017Given patient variation with respect to OAR position and areas of tumor involvement, practical dose constraint guidelines are challenging. \nIn tumors without gross nodal involvement it is often possible to limit OAR doses even further. Alternatively, in tumors with gross nodal \ninvolvement within the pelvis, compromise of PTV coverage may be necessary to limit doses to normal tissues, such as small bowel.

Each institution should have a quality \nassurance program in place for the treatment of patients with anal cancer. \n\u0017The use of image guidance for radiation treatment delivery has significantly improved confidence in daily treatment setup. This has allowed \nfor shrinking CTV to PTV expansions during the treatment planning process, which in turn further minimizes dose to OARs. \n\u0017If it is not possible to achieve the dosimetric goals in Table 2, small bowel max point dose should be limited to Dmax 55 Gy, V45 should be  \n≤150 cc, and V50 should be ≤30 cc for individual small bowel loops.9,10\n• Supportive Care\n\u0017Patients should be considered for vaginal dilators and instructed on the symptoms of vaginal stenosis.\n\u0017Patients of childbearing potential should be counseled about the effects of premature menopause and consideration should be given to \nreferral for discussion of hormone replacement strategies.\n\u0017Patients of childbearing potential should be counseled that an irradiated uterus cannot carry a fetus to term.\n\u0017Patients should be counseled on sexual dysfunction, potential for future low testosterone levels, and infertility risks and given information \nregarding sperm banking or oocyte, egg, or ovarian tissue banking, as appropriate, prior to treatment.PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY1\n1 Ajani JA, Winter KA, Gunderson LL, et al.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-2 \nOverview  \nAn estimated 10,930 new cases ( 3560 male and 7370 female) of cancer \ninvolving the anus, anal canal, or anorectum will occur in the United \nStates in 202 5, accounting for approximately 3% of digestive system \ncancers.1 2030  deaths due to anal cancer are projected to  occur in the \nUnited States in 2025.1 Although  considered to be a rare cancer, the \nincidence rate of invasive anal carcinoma in the United States increased \nby approximately 1.9 -fold for males and 1.5 -fold for females between \nthe periods of 1973 –1979 to 1994 –2000  and has continued to increase \nsince that time.2-4 According to an analysis of SEER data, the incidence \nof anal squamous carcinoma increased at a rate of 2.9% per year from \n1992 to 2001.5 Supporting this, an analysis of the U.S. Cancer Statistics \ndataset reported an annual increase of 2.7% between 2001 to 2015 \nwith the greatest increases in age groups ≥50 years,6 while the National \nProgram of Cancer Registries and SEER programs showed similar \ntrends from 2001 to 2016, with an annual percent change of 2.1 % (95% \nCI, 1.7 –2.5) overall, and 2.8 % (95% CI, 2.5 –3.1) in those ≥50 years of \nage.7 Increases in incidence of anal cancer during that time frame were \nespecially noted for females ≥50 years  of age . Anal cancer mortality \nrates (2001 –2016) also rose, with an average increase of 3.1% per \nyear.6 \nThis Discussion summarizes the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for \nmanaging squamous cell anal carcinoma, which represents the most \ncommon histologic form of the disease. Other groups have also \npublished guidelines for the management of anal squamous cell \ncarcinoma.8-10 Other types of cancers occurring in the anal region are \naddressed in other NCCN Guidelines; anal adenocarcinoma and anal \nmelanoma are managed according to the NCCN Clinical Practice \nGuidelines (NCCN Guidelines) for Rectal Cancer (available at \nwww.NCCN.org ) and the NCCN Guidelines for Melanoma  (available at \nwww.nccn.org ), respectively. Guidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice \nGuidelines (NCCN Guidelines®) for Anal Carcinoma , an electronic \nsearch of the PubMed database was performed  to obtain key literature \nin the field of anal cancer  published since the previous Guidelines \nupdate , using the search terms: anal cancer or anal squamous cell \ncarcinoma . The PubMed database was chosen because  it remains the \nmost widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer -\nreviewed biomedical literature.11 \nThe search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article \ntypes:  Clinical Trial, Phase II ; Clinical Trial,  Phase I II; Clinical Trial , \nPhase IV;  Practice Guideline ; Randomized Controlled Trial s; Meta -\nAnalysis ; Systematic Reviews ; and Validation Studies.  The data from \nkey PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed \nas relevant to these Guidelines as discussed by the Panel during the \nGuidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion \nsection. Recommendations for which high -level evidence is lacking are \nbased on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and  expert opinion.   \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person -first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist , and anti -weight -biased; and \ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. \nNCCN Guidelines incorporate non -gendered language, instead focusing PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-3 \non organ -specific recommendations. This language is both more \naccurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of \nindividuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN \nGuidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, femal e, and \nmale when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from \norganizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies \ndo not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these \nterms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources d o not differentiate \ngender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is \npresumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN \nencourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies \nand organizations to use more  inclusive and accurate language in their \nfuture analyses.  \nRisk Factors  \nAnal carcinoma is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) \ninfection (anal -genital warts); a history of receptive anal intercourse or \nsexually transmitted disease; a history of cervical, vulvar, or vaginal \ncancer; immunosuppression after solid organ tran splantation or human \nimmunodeficiency virus ( HIV) infection; hematologic malignancies ; \ncertain autoimmune disorders; and smoking.12-20 \nThe association between anal carcinoma and persistent infection with a \nhigh-risk form of HPV (eg, HPV -16; HPV -18) is especially strong.13,21,22 \nFor example, a study of tumor specimens from more than 60 pathology \nlaboratories in Denmark and Sweden showed that high -risk HPV DNA \nwas detected in 84% of anal cancer specimens, with HPV -16 detected \nin 73%. In contrast, high -risk HPV was not detected in any of the rectal \nadenocarcinoma  specimens analyzed.13 In addition, results of a \nsystematic review of 35 peer -reviewed anal cancer studies that included \nHPV DNA testing results published up until July 2007 showed the \nprevalence of HPV -16/18 to be 72% in patients with invasive anal cancer.22 Population and registry studies have found similar HPV \nprevalence rates in anal cancer specimens.23,24 A 2012 report from the \nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that \n86% to 97% of cancers of the anus are attributable to HPV infection.25  \nSuppression of the immune system by the use of immunosuppressive \ndrugs or HIV infection likely facilitates persistence of HPV infection of \nthe anal region.26,27 Studies have shown that people  with HIV ( PWH) \nhave an approximately 15 - to 35 -fold increased likelihood of being \ndiagnosed with anal cancer  compared with  the general population.28-31 \nIn PWH, the standardized incidence rate of anal carcinoma per 100,000 \nperson -years in the United States, estimated to be 19.0 in 1992 through \n1995, increased to 78.2 during 2000 through 2003.27 This result likely \nreflects both the survival benefits of modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) \nand the lack of an impact of ART on the progression of anal cancer \nprecursors. The incidence rate of anal cancer has been reported to be \n131 per 100,000 person -years in males who have sex with males \n(MSM) with HIV in North America,  and in 3.9 to 30 per 100,000 person \nyears in females living with HIV.32,33 An analysis of the French Hospital \nDatabase on HIV showed a highly elevated risk of anal cancer in PWH, \nincluding in those who were on therapy and whose CD4+ T -cell counts \nwere high.34 The data also revealed an increasing incidence of anal \ncancer in the PWH population over time.  However, some evidence \nsuggests that prolonged ART (>24 months) may be associated with a \ndecrease in the incidence of high -grade a nal intraepithelial neoplasia  \n(AIN).35 \nA meta -analysis of anal cancer incidence across risk groups found that \nthe incidence of anal cancer in solid organ transplant recipients \nincreased both by age and years since transplant.20 Incidence rates \nrose from 0.0 and 3.1 per 100,000 person years in males and females \n>30 years to 13.4 and 25.9 per 100,000 person years in males and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-4 \nfemales ≥60 years. Years since transplant appeared to identify an even \nhigher risk than age, with an incidence rate of 24.5 and 29.6 per \n100,000 person years in males and females  ≥10 years post -transplant , \nrespectively. This study also assessed risk in individuals with \nautoimmune diseases and found incidence rates of 10, 6, and 3 per \n100,000 person years for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, \nulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease, respectively.  \nA retrospective study used data from 13 population -based HIV and \ncancer registries in the United States from 2001 to 2019, to identify \npredictors of survival between individuals with anal cancer with and \nwithout HIV. Overall , HIV was associated with anal cancer -specific \nhigher mortality, especially in female compared to male individuals (2.47 \nvs. 1.35 times more likely, respectively). Results from this study \nhighlight the importance of early HIV screening in female individuals \nwith anal cancer for risk redu ction.36 \nRisk Reduction  \nThe Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) Project has \nrecommended unified terminology across lower anogenital sites. As \nsuch, condyloma and AIN 1 are referred to as low -grade squamous \nintraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and AIN 2 and 3 as high -grade squa mous \nintraepithelial lesions (HSIL ).37 HSIL (AIN 2/3) can be a precursor to \nanal cancer.38-41 LSIL and HSIL are diagnosed by  digital anorectal \nexamination (DRE/DARE) and  high-resolution anoscopy  (HRA) , \nfollowed by anal pap smear (cytology) and/or biopsy .42,43 A prospective \ncohort study of 550 MSM who were HIV-positive found the rate of \nconversion of HSIL  to anal cancer to be 18% (7/38) at a median follow -\nup of 2.3 years.41 A large randomized controlled trial known as the \nANCHOR Study compared  topical or ablative treatment with monitoring  \nevery 6 months with HRA  in 4459 PWH with anal HSIL .44 With a median \nfollow -up of 25.8 months, 9 cases of anal cancer were diagnosed in the treatment group compared to 21 cases in the active monitoring group. \nThe rate of progression to anal cancer was 57% lower with treatment \ncompared to active monitoring (95% CI, 6 –80; P = .03).  Progression \nfrom anal HSIL  to cancer was 402/100,000 person -years among \nindividuals whose HSIL was monitored without treatment, with a \ncumulative progression to cancer of 1.8% over 4 years.  Given the \nrelatively young median age of the  participants of 51 years and an \nexpected normal life expectancy, this progression rate could lead to a \nsubstantial cumulative risk of developing anal cancer in the absence of \nHSIL treatment.  \nThe optimal approach to screening remains an area of uncertainty , but \nthe benefits of  current  screening  recommendations  for anal HSIL are \npotentially quite large.45-51 Systematic reviews and meta -analyses have \nsuggested that anal cytology is effective in detection of LSIL/HSIL , \nparticularly for individuals at high -risk.52-54 Based on these studies and \nrecent results from the ANCHOR Study, entities have published \nguidelines containing general recommendations for anal cancer \nscreening.55 The I nternational Anal Neoplasia Society (IANS)  and the \nCDC’s  Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic \nInfections in Adults and Adolescents With HIV  recommend initial \nscreening that includes cytology, and HPV screening via either hrHPV \nor hrHPV -cytology co -testing, DARE, and  anoscopy  (HRA , if \navailable) .56,57 According to IANS, if there are no abnormalities \nobserved, repeating screening in 12 months is recommended, but if \nabnormalities are present (such as LSIL/HSIL ) HRA is preferred.56 The \nCDC guidelines concur with the IANS’ follow -up recommendations post -\nresults, but suggest initiating screening with HRA, if available, due to its \nhigher sensitivity to abnormalities.57  \nEarly screening for anal cancer is essential for high-risk groups , but the \nscreening age for these individuals remains  undetermined .

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-5 \nthe IANS  published consensus guidelines for anal cancer screening, \nincluding different risk groups and appropriate age to initiate \nscreening.56 They define two risk categories that are differentiated due \nto their incidence compared to the general population. The Risk \nCategory A (incidence of ≥10 -fold higher) includes PWH,  MSM and \ntransgender women without HIV,  individuals with a history of vulvar \nHSIL or cancer, and solid organ transplant recipients. The \nrecommended age to start screening MSM with HIV and transgender \nwomen with HIV  is 35 years . For women with HIV, MSW with HIV, MSM \nwithout HIV , and transgender women without HIV , the recommended \nscreening age is 45  years . The recommended screening time for \nindividuals with previous vulvar HSIL or cancer is within 1 year of \ndiagnosis and 10 years post -transplant for transplant recipients. Risk \nCategory B (incidence of up to 10-fold higher) includes individuals with \nprevious cervical/vaginal HSIL or cancer, patients who present with \nperianal warts or have persistent cervical infection with HPV -16 (defined \nas over 1 year), and immunocompromised individuals. The \nrecommended age to get anal cancer screeni ng for Rick Category B  \nshould be decided between the patient and healthcare provider, but \nIANS suggests age 45  years . For more information on these risk \ncategories and screening ages, refer to  the International Anal Neoplasia \nSociety's consensus guidelines for anal cancer screening . \nPrior to the publication of ANCHOR,  guidelines for the treatment of \nLSIL/HSIL (AIN 1,  2, and 3) have been developed by several groups, \nincluding the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons \n(ASCRS).50,58 -60 Treatment recommendations vary widely because high -\nlevel evidence in the field was limited prior to ANCHOR.58 Most \nparticipants in the ANCHOR Study were treated with office -based, \ntargeted electrocautery, indicating that this approach could be \nconsidered as a first line of therapy.44 An earlier  randomized controlled \ntrial in 246 MSM with HIV found that e lectrocautery  was superior to both topical imiquimod and topical fluorouracil in the treatment of AIN  \noverall.61 The subgroup with perianal AIN, as opposed to intra -anal AIN, \nappeared to respond better to imiquimod. Regardless of treatment, \nrecurrence rates were high, and careful follow -up is likely needed.  \nHPV Immunization  \nA quadrivalent HPV vaccine is available and has been shown to be \neffective in preventing persistent cervical infection with HPV -6, -11, -16, \nor -18 as well as in preventing high -grade cervical intraepithelial \nneoplasia related to these strains of the virus.62-64 The vaccine has also \nbeen shown to be efficacious in young males  at preventing genital \nlesions associated with HPV -6, -11, -16, or -18 infection.65 A substudy \nof a larger double -blind study assessed the efficacy of the vaccine for \nthe prevention of AIN and anal cancer related to infection with HPV -6,  \n-11, -16, or -18 in MSM .66 In this study, 602 healthy MSM  aged 16 to 26 \nyears were randomized to receive the vaccine or a placebo. While none \nof the participants in either arm developed anal cancer during the 3 -year \nfollow -up period, there were 5 cases of HSIL ( grade 2/3 AIN ) associated \nwith one of the vaccine strains in the vaccine arm and 24 such cases in \nthe placebo arm in the per -protocol population, giving an observed \nefficacy of 77.5% (95% CI , 39.6–93.3). Since high -grade AIN is known \nto have the ability to progress to anal ca ncer,38-40 these results suggest \nthat use of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in MSM  may reduce the risk of \nanal cancer in this population.   \nA bivalent HPV vaccine against HPV -16 and -18 is also available.67 In a \nrandomiz ed, double -blind controlled trial  of female patients in Costa \nRica, the vaccine was 83.6% effective against initial anal HPV -16/18 \ninfection (95% CI, 66.7–92.8).68,69 It has also been shown to be effective \nat preventing high -grade c ervical intraepithelial neoplasia s in young \npeople.70 The effect on precancerous anal lesions has not yet been \nreported.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-6 \nA 9-valent HPV vaccine is also now available, protecting  against HPV -6, \n-11, -16, -18, -31, -33, -45, -52, and -58.71 Targeting the additional \nstrains over the quadrivalent vaccine is predicted to prevent an \nadditional 464 cases of anal cancer annually.72 This vaccine was \ncompared to the quadrivalent vaccine in an international, randomized  \nphase IIb–III study that included  more than 14,000  female patients.73 \nThe 9 -valent vaccine was noninferior to the quadrivalent vaccine for \nantibody response to HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 and prevented infection \nand disease related  to the other viral strains included in the vaccine. \nThe calculated efficacy of the 9 -valent vaccine was 96.7%  (95% CI, \n80.9–99.8)  for the prevention of high-grade cervical, vulvar, or vaginal \ndisease  related to those strains.  A follow -up study of a phase III trial \nshowed that the 9 -valent vaccine sustained efficacy and \nimmunogenicity, and aided in pr evention of HPV incidence after 10 \nyears post -vaccination .74  \nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  (ACIP)  \nrecommend s routine use  of the 9 -valent vaccine in children aged 11 \nand 12 years, as well as catch -up vaccination for individuals through 26 \nyears of age who have not been previously vaccinated.75-78 The \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics  concurs with this vaccination \nschedule.79 ASCO released a statement regarding HPV vaccination for \ncancer prevention with the goal of increasing vaccine update.80 In 2018, \nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) expanded use of the 9 -\nvalent vaccine to include individuals aged 27 through 45 years ,81 and \nthe ACIP voted in 2019 to recommend vaccination, based on shared \nclinical decision -making, for individuals in this age range who are not \nadequately vaccinated.   \nAnatomy/Histology  \nThe anal region is comprised of the anal canal and the perianal region, \ndividing anal cancers into two primary locations . The anal canal is the most proximal portion of the anal region  extending distally into the \nperianal region . The 9th Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual \ndefines  anal canal cancer s as tumors that cannot be  entirely  seen when \nthe buttocks are gently pressed.82 The corresponding definition s for \nperianal cancer are tumors that  1) arise within the skin distal to  or at the \nsquamous mucocutaneous junction ; 2) can be visualized completely \nwhen the buttocks are gently pressed;  and 3) are within 5 cm of the \nanus.82 Various definitions of the anal canal exist such as  functional , \nsurgical , anatomic  and histologic that are based on particular \nphysical/anatomic landmarks or microscopic features . \nHistologically, the anal canal can be divided into thirds. The most \nproximal or upper zone is lined by glandular columnar epithelium with \ngoblet cells, similar to colorectal mucosa. The middle zone is \ncharacterized by transitional epithelium , which demonstrates a range of \nmorphologies including scattered goblet cells intermixed with squamous \nand urothelial features. The distal lower third is comprised of \nnonkeratinizing squamous epithelium devoid of epidermal appendages \n(hair follicles, apocri ne glands and sweat glands).  Moving distally into \nthe perianal region, squamous mucosa merges with keratinized perianal \nskin at the anal margin  (anal verge ).15,82 -84 \nThe anatomic anal canal begins at the anorectal ring and extends to the \nanal verge (ie, squamous mucocutaneous junction with the perianal \nskin).85 \nFunctionally, the anal canal is defined by the sphincter muscles. The \nsuperior border of the functional anal canal, separating it from the \nrectum, has been defined as the palpable upper border of the anal \nsphincter and puborectalis muscles of the anorectal ring. It is \napproximately 3 to 5 cm in length, and its inferior border starts at the \nanal verge, the lowermost edge of the sphincter muscles, corresponding \nto the introitus of the anal orifice.15,83,86 The functional definition of the PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-7 \nanal canal is primarily used in the radical surgical treatment of anal \ncancer and is used in these guidelines to differentiate between \ntreatment options. The anal margin starts at the anal verge and includes \nthe perianal skin over a 5 - to 6-cm radius from the squamous \nmucocutaneous junction.83 Tumors can involve the anal canal , the anal \nmargin , and the perianal skin . \nPathology  \nMost primary cancers of the anal canal  are of squamous cell histology.83 \nEarlier editions  of the WHO classification  of tumors of the anal canal  \ndesignated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anal canal as \ncloacogenic and identified subtypes as large -cell keratinizing, large -cell \nnon-keratinizing (transitional), or basaloid.87 In the most current 5th \nedition, different histologic patterns are described. However, all \nsubtypes are included under a single diagnosis of SCC .15,82,88,89 \nReasons for this change include the following: both cloacogenic (which \nis sometimes used interchangeably with the term basaloid) and \ntransitional tumors are now considered to be non -keratinizing tumors; it \nhas been reported that both keratinizing and non -keratinizing tumors \nhave a similar natural history and prognosis88; and a mixture of cell \ntypes is frequently present in these tumors .83,88,90 No distinction between \nsquamous anal canal tumors based on  cell type has been made in \nthese guidelines. Although the existence of one low -grade subtype, \nverrucous carcinoma (VC), is worth mentioning as rendering a definitive \ndiagnosis on superficial biopsy material is challenging. This lesion \ndemonstrates marked exophytic and endophytic growth without featur es \nof HPV cytopathic effect or high -grade cytologic atypia. When \nconventional SCC is identified arising in VC the diagnosis should be \nSCC as these lesi ons have similar biology as conventional SCC. Other \nless common anal canal tumors, not addressed in these guidelines, \ninclude adenocarcinomas in the rectal mucosa or the anal glands, small \ncell (anaplastic) carcinoma, undifferentiated cancers, and melanomas.83 Perianal squamous cell carcinomas are more likely than those of the \nanal canal to be well -differentiated and keratinizing large -cell types,91 \nbut they are not characterized in the guidelines according to cell type. \nThe presence of skin appendages (eg, hair follicles, sweat glands) in \nperianal tumors can distinguish them from anal canal tumors. However, \nit is not always possible to distinguish b etween anal canal and perianal \nsquamous cell carcinoma since tumors can involve both areas.  \nLymph drainage of anal cancer tumors is depend ent on the location of \nthe tumor in the anal region : cancers in the perianal skin and the region \nof the anal canal distal to the dentate line drain mainly to the superficial \ninguinal nodes .82,83 Lymph drainage at and proximal to the dentate line \nis directed toward  the anorectal, perirectal, and paravertebral nodes and \nto some of the nodes of the internal iliac system . More proximal cancers \ndrain to perirectal nodes and to nodes of the inferior mesenteric system . \nTherefore, distal anal cancers present with a higher incidence of \ninguinal node metastases. Because the lymphatic drainage systems \nthroughout the anal canal are not isolated from each other , however, \ninguinal node metastases can occur in proximal anal cancer as well .83 \nThe College of American Pathologists publishes protocol s for the \npathologic examination and reporting of anal tumors  following excision \nor transabdominal resection . The most recent update s incorporating \nAJCC 9th edition updates  were made in September 2023  and June \n2022 , respectively .92,93 \nStaging  \nThe TNM  staging system for anal canal cancer developed by the AJCC \nis detailed in the guidelines .82 Because current recommendations for the \nprimary treatment of anal canal cancer do not involve a surgical \nexcision, most tumors are staged clinically with an emphasis on the size \nof the primary tumor as determined by direct examination and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-8 \nmicroscopic confirmation. A tumor biopsy is required . Rectal ultrasound \nto determine depth of tumor invasion is not used in the staging of anal \ncancer (see Clinical Presentation/Evaluation , below).  \nIn the past, these guidelines have used the AJCC TNM skin cancer \nsystem for the staging of perianal cancer since the two types of cancers \nhave a similar biology. However, the 7th edition of the AJCC Cancer \nStaging Manual included substantial changes to the  cutaneous \nsquamous cell carcinoma stagings,94 making them much less \nappropriate for the staging of perianal cancers. Furthermore, many \nperianal cancers have involvement of the anal canal or have high -\ngrade, pre -cancerous lesions in the anal canal. It is important to look for \nsuch anal canal involveme nt, particularly if conservative management \n(simple excision) is being contemplated. Many patients, particularly \nPWH, could be significantly undertreated. For these reasons, these \nguidelines use the AJCC anus staging system for both anal canal and \nperianal  tumors.  \nThe prognosis of anal carcinoma is related to the size of the primary \ntumor and the presence of lymph node metastases.15 According to the \nSEER database,95 between 1999 and 2006, 50% of anal carcinomas \nwere localized at initial diagnosis; these patients had an 80% 5 -year \nsurvival rate. Approximately 29% of patients had anal carcinoma that \nhad already spread to regional lymph nodes at diagnosis; these patient s \nhad a 60% 5 -year survival rate. The 12% of patients presenting with \ndistant metastasis demonstrated a 30.5% 5 -year survival rate.95 In a \nretrospective study of 270 patients treated for anal canal cancer with \nradiation therapy (RT) between 1980 and 1996, synchronous inguinal \nnode metastasis was observed in 6.4% of patients with tumors staged \nas T1 or T2, and in 16% of patients with T3 o r T4 tumors.96 In patients \nwith N2 –3 disease, survival was related to T -stage rather than nodal \ninvolvement with respective 5 -year survival rates of 72.7% and 39.9% for patients with T1 –T2 and T3 –T4 tumors; however, the number of \npatients involved in this analysis was small.96 An analysis of more than \n600 patients with non -metastatic anal carcinoma from the RTOG 98 -11 \ntrial also found that the tumor and node categories impacted clinical \noutcomes such as overall survival (OS), disease -free survival (DFS), \nand colostomy failure, with the worst prognoses for patients with T4,N0 \nand T3 –4,N+ disease.97 \nBy the 8th edition of AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the former  N2 and \nN3 categories by locations of positive nodes were removed .98 New \ncategories of N1a, N1b, and N1c were defined  and then further refined \nin the 9th edition .82 N1a now represents metastasis in inguinal, \nmesorectal, superior rectal,  internal iliac , or obturator  nodes. N1b \nrepresents metastasis in external iliac nodes. N1c represents \nmetastasis in ext ernal iliac with any N1a nodes. However, initial therapy \nof anal cancer does not typically involve surgery, and the true lymph \nnode status may not be determined accurately by clinical and radiologic \nevaluation. Fine -needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of inguin al nodes can \nbe considered if tumor metastasis to these nodes is  suspected. In a \nseries of patients with anal cancer who underwent an abdominoperineal \nresection (APR), it was noted that pelvic nodal metastases were often \n<0.5 cm,99 suggesting that routine radiologic evaluation with CT and \nFDG -PET/CT scan may not be reliable in the determination of lymph \nnode involvement (discussed in more detail in Clinical \nPresentation/Evaluation , below).  \nPrognostic Factors  \nMultivariate analysis of data from the RTOG 98 -11 trial showed that \nmale sex and positive lymph nodes were independent prognostic \nfactors for DFS in patients with anal cancer treated with 5 -FU and \nradiation and either mitomycin or cisplatin.100 Male sex, positive nodes, \nand tumor size >5 cm were independently prognostic for worse OS.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-9 \nsecondary analysis of this trial found that tumor diameter could also be \nprognostic for colostomy rate and time to colostomy.101 These results \nare consistent with earlier analyses from the EORTC 22861 trial, which \nfound male sex, lymph node involvement, and skin ulceration to be \nprognostic for worse survival and local control.102 Similarly, multivariate \nanalyses of data from the ACT I trial also showed that positive lymph \nnodes and male sex are prognostic indicators for higher local regional \nfailure, anal cancer death, and lower OS.103 \nData suggest that HPV - and/or p16 -positivity are prognostic for \nimproved OS in patients with anal carcinoma.104-107 In a retrospective \nstudy of 143 tumor samples, p16 -positivity was a n independent \nprognostic factor for OS ( hazard ratio [ HR], 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01 –0.61; P \n= .016) .105 Another study of 95 patients found similar results.104 \nManagement of Anal Carcinoma  \nClinical Presentation/Evaluation  \nApproximately 45% of patients  with anal carcinoma present with rectal \nbleeding, while approximately 30% have either pain or the sensation of \na rectal mass.15 Following confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma by \nbiopsy, the recommendations of the NCCN Anal Carcinoma Guidelines \nPanel for the clinical evaluation of patients with anal canal or perianal \ncancer are very similar .  \nThe Panel recommends a thorough examination/evaluation, including a \ncareful DRE, an anoscopic examination, and palpation of the inguinal \nlymph nodes, with FNA and/or excisional biopsy of nodes found to be \nenlarged by either clinical or radiologic examination. Evaluation of pelvic \nlymph nodes with CT or MRI of the pelvis is also recommended. These \nmethods can also provide information on whether the tumor involves \nother abdominal/pelvic organs; however, assessment of T stage is  \nprimarily performed through clinical examination. A CT scan of the abdomen is also recommended to assess possible disease \ndissemination. Since veins of the anal region are part of the venous \nnetwork associated with systemic circulation,83 chest CT scan is \nperformed to evaluate for pulmonary metastasis.  Gynecologic exam, \nincluding cervical cancer screening, is suggested due to the association \nof anal cancer and HPV .13 A discussion of infertility risks and counseling \non fertility preservation, if appropriate, should be carried out prior to the \nstart of treatment.  \nHIV testing should be performed if the patient’s HIV status is unknown, \nbecause the risk of anal carcinoma has been reported to be higher in \nPWH.17 Furthermore, about 13% of  people in the United States  who are \ninfected with HIV are not aware of their infection status ,108 and \nindividuals who are unaware of their HIV -positive  status do not receive \nthe clinical care they need to reduce HIV -related morbidity and mortality \nand may unknowingly transmit HIV.109 HIV testing may be particularly \nimportant in people with cancer, because identification of HIV infection \nhas the potential to improve clinical ou tcomes.110 The CDC \nrecommends HIV screening for all individuals  in all health  care settings \nunless the patient declines testing (opt -out screening).111 \nFDG -PET/CT scanning, or FDG -PET/MRI, can be considered to verify \nstaging before treatment. FDG -PET/CT scanning has been reported to \nbe useful in the evaluation of pelvic nodes, even in patients with anal \ncanal cancer who have normal -sized lymph nodes on CT imaging.112-117 \nA systematic review and meta -analysis of seven  retrospective and five \nprospective studies calculated pooled estimates  of sensitivity and \nspecificity for detection of lymph node involvement by FDG -PET/CT to \nbe 56% (95% CI , 45–67) and 90% (95% CI , 86–93), respectively .113 A \nmore recent meta -analysis of 17 clinical studies calculated the pooled \nsensitivity and specificity for detection of lymph node involvement by \nFDG -PET/CT at  93% and 76% , respectively.118 The use of FDG -PET or PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-10 \nFDG -PET/CT led to upstaging in 5% to 38% of patients and \ndownstag ing in  8% to 27% of patients. Another systematic review and \nmeta -analysis found FDG -PET/CT to change nodal status and TNM \nstage in 21% and 41% of patients, respectively.119 FDG -PET/CT results \ncan also impact radiation therapy planning, as systematic reviews and \nmeta -analyses have shown that t reatment plan modifi cations occurred  \nin 12 % to 59% of patients  based on FDG -PET/CT results .118,120 The \nPanel does not consider FDG -PET/CT to be a replacement for a \ndiagnostic CT.  \nAccording to a systematic review and meta -regression , the proportion of \nindividuals who are node -positive by pretreatment clinical imaging has \nincreased from 15.3 % (95% CI , 10.5–20.1) in 1980 to 37 .1% (95% CI, \n34.0–41.3) in 2012 ( P < .0001), likely resulting from the increased use \nof more sensitive imaging techniques.121 This increase in lymph node \npositivity was associated with improvements in OS for both the lymph -\nnode –positive and the lymph -node –negative groups. Because the \nproportion of patients with T3/T4 disease remained constant and \ntherefore disease is not truly b eing diagnosed at more advanced stages \nover time, the authors attribute the improved OS results to the Will \nRogers effect: The average survival of both groups increases as \npatients with worse -than-average survival in the node -negative group \nmigrate to the node -positive group, in which their survival is better than \naverage. Thus, the survival of individuals has not necessarily improved \nover time, even though the average survival of each group has. Using \nsimulated scenarios, the authors further conclude that the actual rate of \ntrue node -positivity is likely <30%, suggesting that it is possible some \npatients are being misclassified and overtreated with the increased use \nof highly sensitive imaging.   Primary Treatment of Non -Metastatic Anal Carcinoma  \nIn the past, patients with invasive anal carcinoma were routinely treated \nwith an APR; however, local recurrence rates were high, 5 -year survival \nwas only 40% to 70%, and the morbidity with a permanent colostomy \nwas considerable.15 In 1974, Nigro and coworkers observed complete \ntumor regression in some patients with anal carcinoma treated with \npreoperative 5 -FU–based concurrent chemotherapy and radiation \n(chemoRT) including either mitomycin or porfiromycin, suggesting that it \nmight be possible to cure anal carcinoma without surgery and \npermanent colostomy.122 Subsequent nonrandomized studies using \nsimilar regimens and varied doses of chemoRT provided support for this \nconclusion.123,124 Results of randomized trials evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of administering chemotherapy with RT support the use of \ncombined modality therapy in the treatment of anal cancer.18 \nSummaries of clinical trials involving patients with anal cancer have \nbeen presented,125,126 and several key trials are discussed below.  \nChemotherapy  \nA phase III study from the EORTC compared the use of chemoRT (5 -\nFU plus mitomycin) to RT alone in the treatment of anal carcinoma. \nResults from this trial showed that patients in the chemoRT arm had an \n18% higher rate of locoregional control at 5 years and  a 32% longer \ncolostomy -free interval.102 The United Kingdom Coordinating Committee \non Cancer Research (UKCCCR) randomized ACT I trial confirmed that \nchemoRT with 5 -FU and mitomycin was more effective in controlling \nlocal disease than RT alone (relative risk  [RR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42 –0.69; \nP < .0001), although no significant differences in OS were observed at 3 \nyears.127 A published follow -up study on these patients demonstrates \nthat a clear benefit of chemoRT remains after 13 years, including a \nbenefit in OS.128 The median survival was 5.4 years in the RT arm and \n7.6 years in the chemoRT arm. There was also a reduction in the risk of \ndying from anal cancer (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 –0.88; P = .004).

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-11 \nsystematic review and meta -analysis comparing outcomes in individuals  \nwith stage I anal carcinoma found an increased 5 -year OS in patients \ntreated with chemoRT  compared to RT alone (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10 –\n1.26; P < .00001) but no significant difference in 5 -year DFS (RR, 1.01; \n95% CI, 0.92 –1.11; P = 0.87 ).129 Conversely, a population -based cohort \nanalysis of Medicare -eligible (>65 years of age or with an eligible \ndisability) patients with stage I anal cancer showed no difference in OS, \ncause -specific survival, colostomy -free survival, or DFS with  chemoRT \nversus RT alone after adjustment using propensity score methods.130 \nTherefore, this study concludes that radiation alone may allow for \nadequate oncologic outcomes for highly select ed patients with stage I \nanal cancer, although it is important to note that this study did not \ndifferentiate between anal  canal and perianal cancers. Current NCCN \nGuideline Recommendations for the Primary Treatment of Anal Canal \nCancer  and Recommendations for the Primary Treatment of Perianal \nCancer  can be found below . \nA few studies have addressed the efficacy and safety of specific \nchemotherapeutic agents in the chemoRT regimens used in the \ntreatment of anal carcinoma.100,131,132 In a phase III Intergroup study, \npatients receiving chemoRT  with the combination of 5 -FU and \nmitomycin had a lower colostomy rate (9% vs. 22%; P = .002) and a \nhigher 4 -year DFS (73% vs. 51%; P = .0003) compared with patients \nreceiving chemoRT with 5 -FU alone, indicating that mitomycin is an \nimportant component of chemoRT in the treatment of anal carcinoma.132 \nThe OS rate at 4 years was the same for the two groups, however, \nreflecting the ability to treat recurrent patients with additional chemoRT \nor an APR. The phase II JROSG 10 -2 trial of 31 individuals with \nsquamous cell anal cancer treated with concurrent chemoRT with 5 -FU \nand mitomycin in Japan has reported 2 -year DFS, OS, local control, and \ncolostomy -free survival of 77.4%, 93.5%, 83.9%, and 80.6%, \nrespectively.133 Capecitabine, an oral fluoropyrimidine prodrug, is an accepted \nalternative to 5 -FU in the treatment of colon and rectal cancer.134-137 \nCapecitabine has been assessed as an alternative to 5 -FU in chemoRT \nregimens for non -metastatic anal cancer.138-141 Doses throughout the \nradiation course on treatment days may offer improved radiation \nsensitization compared to two courses of 5 -FU infusion during the \nchemoRT course. A retrospective study compared 58 patients treated \nwith capecitabine to 47 patients trea ted with infusional 5 -FU; both \ngroups also received mitomycin and concurrent radiation.140 No \nsignificant differences were seen in clinical complete response, 3 -year \nlocoregional control, 3 -year OS, or colostomy -free survival between the \ntwo groups of patients. Another retrospective study compared 27 \npatients treated with capecitabine to 62 pat ients treated with infusional \n5-FU; as in the other study, both groups also received mitomycin and \nradiation.139 Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities were significantly lower in \nthe capecitabine group, with no oncologic outcomes reported. A phase \nII study found that chemo RT with capecitabine  and mitomycin was safe \nand resulted in a 6 -month locoregional control rate of 86% (95% CI, \n0.72–0.94) in individuals with localized anal cancer.142 Although data for \nthis regimen are limited, the Panel recommends mitomycin/capecitabine \nplus radiation as an alternative to mitomycin/5 -FU plus radiation in the \nsetting of stage I through III anal cancer.  \nCisplatin as a substitute for 5 -FU was evaluated in a phase II trial, and \nresults suggest that cisplatin -containing and 5 -FU–containing chemoRT \nmay be comparable for treatment of locally advanced anal cancer.131 \nThe efficacy of replacing mitomycin with cisplatin  has also been \nassessed. The phase III UK ACT II trial  compared cisplatin with \nmitomycin and also looked at the effect of additional maintenance \nchemotherapy following chemoRT.143 In this study , more than  900 \nindividuals  with newly diagnosed anal cancer were randomly assigned PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-12 \nto primary treatment with either 5 -FU/mitomycin or 5 -FU/cisplatin with \nradiotherapy . A continuous course (ie, no treatment gap) of radiation of \n50.4 Gy was administered in both arms, and patients in each arm were \nfurther randomized to receive two cycles of maintenance therapy with 5 -\nFU and cisplatin or no maintenance therapy. At a median follow -up of \n5.1 years, no differences were observed in the primary endpoint of \ncomplete response rate in either arm for the chemoRT comparison or in \nthe primary endpoint o f progression -free survival  (PFS) for the \ncomparison of maintenance therapy versus no maintenance therapy. In \naddition, a secondary endpoint , colostomy , show ed no  differences \nbased on the chemotherapeutic components of chemoRT . These \nresults demonstrate that replacement of mitomycin with cisplatin in \nchemoRT does not  affect  the rate of complete response , nor does \nadministration of maintenance therapy decrease the rate of disease \nrecurrence following primary treatment with chemoRT in patients with \nanal cance r. \nCisplatin as a substitute for mitomycin in the treatment of patients with \nnon-metastatic anal carcinoma was also evaluated in the randomized \nphase III Intergroup RTOG 98 -11 trial. The role of induction \nchemotherapy was also assessed. In this study, 682 pat ients were \nrandomly assigned to receive either: 1) induction 5 -FU plus cisplatin for \ntwo cycles followed by concurrent chemoRT with 5 -FU and cisplatin; or \n2) concurrent chemoRT with 5 -FU and mitomycin.100,144 A significant \ndifference was observed in the primary endpoint, 5 -year DFS, in favor of \nthe mitomycin group (57.8% vs. 67.8%; P = .006).144 Five-year OS was \nalso significantly better in the mitomycin arm (70.7% vs. 78.3%; P = \n.026).144 In addition, 5 -year colostomy -free survival showed a trend \ntowards statistical significance (65.0% vs. 71.9%; P = .05), again in \nfavor of the mitomycin group. Since the two treatment arms in the \nRTOG 98 -11 trial differed with respect to use of either cisplatin or \nmitomycin in concurrent chemoRT as well as inclusion of induction chemotherapy in the cisplatin -containing arm, it is difficult to attribute \nthe differences to the substitution of cisplatin for mitomycin or to the use \nof induction chemotherapy.125,145 However, since ACT II demonstrated \nthat the two chemoRT regimens are equivalent, some have suggested \nthat results from RTOG 98 -11 suggest that induction chemotherapy is \nprobably detrimental.146 \nResults from ACCORD 03 also suggest that there is no benefit of a \ncourse of chemotherapy given prior to chemoRT.147 In this study, \nindividuals with locally advanced anal cancer were randomized to \nreceive induction therapy with 5 -FU/cisplatin or no induction therapy \nfollowed by chemoRT (they were further randomized to receive an \nadditional radiation boost or not). No differences were seen between \ntumor complete response, tumor partial response, 3 -year colostomy -\nfree survival, local control, event -free survival, or 3 -year OS. After a \nmedian follow -up of 50 months, no advantage to induction \nchemotherapy (or to the addition al radiation boost) was observed, \nconsistent with earlier results. A systematic review of randomized trials \nalso showed no benefit to a course of induction chemotherapy.148 \nA retrospective analysis, however, suggests that induction \nchemotherapy preceding chemoRT may be beneficial for the subset of \npatients with T4 anal cancer.149 The 5 -year colostomy -free survival rate \nwas significantly better in T4 patients who received induction 5 -\nFU/cisplatin compared to those who did not (100% vs. 38  ± 16.4%; P = \n.0006).  \nThe combination of 5 -FU, mitomycin C, and cisplatin has also been \nstudied in a phase II trial, but was found to be too toxic.150 The safety \nand efficacy of capecitabine/oxaliplatin with radiation for the treatment \nof localized anal cancer has been investigated in a phase II study, \nwhich reported that the regimen was safe, with promising efficacy, \nalthough larger trials would be nee ded to confirm these results.151  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-13 \nThere has also been interest in the use of biologic therapies for the \ntreatment of anal cancer. A phase 3 trial is investigating the use of the \nprogrammed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab, following \ncombined modality therapy for high-risk anal carcinoma.152 This trial has \ncompleted enrollment of 344 participants and results are pending. \nCetuximab is an epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitor, \nwhose anti -tumor activity is dependent on the presence of wild -type \nKRAS .153 Because  KRAS  mutations appear to be very rare in anal \ncancer,154,155 the use of an EGFR inhibitor such as cetuximab has been \nconsidered to  be a promising avenue of investigation. The phase II \nECOG 3205 and AIDS Malignancy Consortium 045 trials evaluated the \nsafety and efficacy of cetuximab with cisplatin/5 -FU and radiation in \nimmunocompetent (E3205) and PWH  (AMC045) with anal squamous \ncell carcinoma.156,157 Results from E3205 and AMC045 were published \nin 2017. In a post hoc analysis of E3205 , the 3 -year locoregional failure  \nrate was 21% (95% CI, 7 –26) by Kaplan -Meier estimate .156 The \ntoxicities associated with the regimen were substantial, with grade 4 \ntoxicity occurr ing in 32%  of the study population and three  treatment -\nassociated deaths  (5%) . In AMC045, the 3 -year locoregional failure  rate \nwas 20% (95% CI, 10 –37) by Kaplan -Meier estimate.157 Grade 4 toxicity \nand treatment -associated rates were similar to that seen in E3205, at \n26% and 4%, respectively. Two other trials that have assessed the use \nof cetuximab in this setting have also found it to increase toxicity, \nincluding a phase I study of  cetuximab with 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and \nradiation.158 The ACCORD 16 phase II trial , which was designed to \nassess response rate after chemoRT with cisplatin/5 -FU and cetuximab, \nwas terminated prematurely because of extremely high rates of serious \nadverse events.159 The 15 evaluable patients from ACCORD 16 had a \n4-year DFS rate of 53% (95% CI, 28 –79), and two of the five patients \nwho completed the planned treatments had locoregional recurrences.160  For older patients or those who are unlikely to tolerate mitomycin, the \noptimal chemotherapy regimen remains uncertain. Some NCCN Panel \nmembers have used a combination of weekly cisplatin and daily 5 -FU \non days of radiation161 for chemoRT in localized anal cancer. Other \npotential strategies for this patient population may include capecitabine \nplus RT or RT alone (without chemotherapy). However, due to a lack of \ndata supporting this approach and differing strategies among Panel \nmembers, recommendations have not yet been defined for individuals \nwith anal cancer who are not candidates for intensive therapy.  Use of a \ngeriatric assessment to guide management and elicitation of the \npatient’s goals and objectives with regard to their c ancer diagnosis is \ncritical to inform shared decision -making discussions in these situations \n(See the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology , available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).  \nRadiation Therapy  \nPrior to the start of RT, patients should be counseled on infertility risks \nand given information regarding sperm banking or oocyte, egg, or \novarian tissue banking, as appropriate. In addition, patients should be \ncounseled on risks for early treatment -induced menopause and \nchanges to sexual function. See the NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship  \n(available at www.NCCN.org ) and the NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent \nand Young Adult (AYA) Oncology  (available at www.NCCN.org ) for \nmore information.  Patients should be considered for vaginal dilators  \ndaily during treatment , which can reduce RT doses to sexual organs at \nrisk,162 and instructed on the symptoms of vaginal stenosis.  \nThe optimal dose and schedule of RT for anal carcinoma continues to \nbe explored and has been evaluated in a number of nonrandomized \nstudies. In one study of patients with early -stage (T1 or Tis) anal canal \ncancer, most patients were effectively treated wit h RT doses of 40 to 50 \nGy for Tis lesions and 50 to 60 Gy for T1 lesions.163 In another study, in PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-14 \nwhich the majority of patients had stage II/III anal canal cancer, local \ncontrol of disease was higher in patients who received RT doses \ngreater than 50 Gy than in those who received lower doses (86.5% vs. \n34%; P = .012).164 In a third study of patients with T3, T4, or lymph \nnode -positive tumors, RT doses of greater than or equal to 54 Gy \nadministered with limited treatment breaks (<60 days) were associated \nwith increased local control .165 The effect of further escalation of \nradiation dose was assessed in the ACCORD 03 trial, with the primary \nendpoint of colostomy -free survival at 3 years.147 No benefit was seen \nwith the higher dose of radiation . These results are supported by much \nearlier results from the RTOG 92 -08 trial166 and suggest that doses of \ngreater than 59 Gy provide no additional benefit to individuals with anal \ncancer. The randomized, phase 2 DECREASE study (NCT04166318) is \ncurrently looking at how well lower -dose chemoRT works in comparison \nto standard -dose chemoRT  for patients with stage I or IIA anal \ncancer.167 Patients on this study are randomized to either 28 fractions \n(standard -dose) or 20 or 23 fractions (deintensified dose) of intensity -\nmodulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ). Study completion is expected in \n2029 .  \nThere is evidence that treatment interruptions, either planned or \nrequired by treatment -related toxicity, can compromise the effectiveness \nof treatment.116 In the phase II RTOG 92 -08 trial, a planned 2-week \ntreatment break in the delivery of chemoRT to individuals  with anal \ncancer was associated with increased locoregional  failure rates and \nlower colostomy -free survival rates when compared  to patients who only \nhad treatment breaks for severe skin toxicity,168 although the trial was \nnot designed for that particular comparison. In addition, the absence of \na planned treatment break in the ACT II trial was considered to be at \nleast partially responsible for the high colostomy -free survival rates \nobserved in that s tudy (74% at 3 years).143 A post hoc analysis from the \nACT II trial revealed worse outcomes if the planned RT dose was extended to more than 42 days, with a significant increase in the risk of \nPFS event ( P = .01) and worse OS ( P = .006).169 Although results of \nthese and other studies have supported the benefit of delivery  of \nchemoRT over shorter time periods,170-172 treatment breaks in the \ndelivery of chemoRT are required in up to 80% of patients since \nchemoRT -related toxicities are common.172 For example, it has been \nreported that one -third of individuals receiving primary chemoRT for \nanal carcinoma at RT doses of 30 Gy in 3 weeks develop acute \nanoproctitis  and perineal dermatitis, increasing to one -half to two -thirds \nof patients when RT doses of 54 to 60 Gy are administered in 6 to 7 \nweeks.83 \nSome of the reported  late side effects of chemoRT include increased \nfrequency and urgency of defecation, chronic perineal dermatitis, \ndyspareunia, and impotence.173,174 In some cases, severe late RT \ncomplications, such as anal ulcers, stenosis, and necrosis, may \nnecessitate surgery involving colostomy.174 In addition, results from a \nretrospective cohort study of data from the SEER registry showed the \nrisk of subsequent pelvic fracture to be 3 -fold higher in female patients \n≥65 years undergoing RT for anal cancer compared with female \npatients of the same age with anal cancer who did not receive RT.175 \nAn increasing body of literature suggests that toxicity can be reduced \nwith advanced radiation delivery techniques.116,176 -186 IMRT utilizes \ndetailed beam shaping to target specific volumes and limit the exposure \nof normal tissue.185 Multiple pilot studies have demonstrated reduced \ntoxicity while maintaining local control using IMRT. For example, in a \ncross -study comparison of a multicenter study of 53 patients with anal \ncancer treated with concurrent 5 -FU/mitomycin chemotherapy and \nIMRT compared to patients in the 5 -FU/mitomycin arm of the \nrandomized RTOG 98 -11 study, which used conventional 3 -D RT, the \nrates of grade 3/4 dermatologic toxicity were 38%/0% for patients PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

In one retrospective comparison between IMRT an d \nconventional radiotherapy, IMRT was less toxic and showed better \nefficacy in 3 -year OS, locoregional control, and PFS.187 In a larger \nretrospective comparison, no significant differences in local recurrence -\nfree survival, distant metastasis -free survival, colostomy -free survival, \nand OS at 2 years were seen between patients receiving IMRT and \nthose receiving 3 -D conformal ra diotherapy, despite the fact that the \nIMRT group had a higher average N stage.188  \nRTOG 0529 was a prospective clinical trial investigating if dose -painted \nIMRT/5 -FU/mitomycin could decrease the rate of gastrointestinal and \ngenitourinary adverse effects compared to patients treated with \nconventional radiation/5 -FU/mitomycin from RTOG 98 -11. This trial did \nnot meet its primary endpoint of reducing grade 2+ combined acute \ngenitourinary and gastrointestinal adverse events by 15% compared to \nconventional radiation on RTOG 98 -11.189 Of 52 evaluable patients, the \ngrade 2+ combined acute adverse event rate was 77%; the rate in \nRTOG 98 -11 was also 77%. However, significant reductions were seen \nin grade 2+ hematologic events (73% vs. 85%; P = .032), grade 3+ \ngastrointestinal events (21% vs. 36%; P = .008), and grade 3+ \ndermatologic events (23% vs. 49%; P < .0001). Subsequently, long -\nterm outcomes and toxicities of individuals  with anal cancer treated with \ndose -painted IMRT as per RTOG 0529 have been reported.190,191 Of 99 \neligible patients identified in the 2017 publication, 92% had a clinically \ncomplete response after a median follow -up of 49 months.191 The 4 -\nyear OS was 85.5% and the 4 -year event -free survival was 75.5%. The \nrate of grade ≥2 non-hematologic late toxicities was 15%.  In a longer -\nterm follow -up with  52 eligible patients, the 8 -year OS was 68% and the 8-year disease -free survival was 62%.190 The rate of grade 2 late \nadverse events was 55%, 16% for grade 3, 0 for grade 4, and 4% for \ngrade 5 events.  \nA retrospective cohort study using the 2014 linkage of the SEER -\nMedicare database  showed that  IMRT is associated with higher total \ncosts than 3 -D conformal radiation ( median total cost, $35,890 v s. \n$27,262; P < .001 ), but unplanned health care utilization costs  (ie, \nhospitalizations and emergency department visits ) are higher for those \nreceiving conformal radiation ( median, $711 v s. $4,957  at 1 year; P = \n.02).192 \nRecommendations regarding RT doses follow the multifield technique \nused in the RTOG 98 -11 trial.100 After clinical and radiologic staging, \nCT-based simulation is performed for radiation treatment planning. If \navailable, MRI pelvis, FDG -PET/CT , or FDG -PET/ MRI at the time of \nsimulation may be helpful to define local and regional target structures.  \nAll patients should receive a minimum RT dose of 45 Gy to the primary \ncancer. The recommended initial RT dose is 30.6 Gy to the pelvis, \nanus, perineum, and inguinal nodes; there should be attempts to reduce \nthe dose to the femoral heads. Field reduction o ff the superior field \nborder and node -negative inguinal nodes is recommended after delivery \nof 30.6 Gy and 36 Gy, respectively. For patients treated with an \nanteroposterior /posteroanterior (AP /PA) rather than multifield technique, \nthe dose to the lateral inguinal region should be brought to the minimum \ndose of 36 Gy using an anterior electron boost matched to the PA exit \nfield. Patients with T1-2 lesions  should receive an additional boost of 9 \nto 14 Gy  for a total of 45 Gy . For patients with T1 -2 lesions with resi dual \ndisease after receiving 45 Gy dose, T3 -4 lesions, or N1 lesions, \nadditional 5.4 –14.4 Gy should be given in 1.8 –2 Gy daily fractions for a \ntotal dose of 50.4 –59.4 Gy. The consensus of the Panel is that IMRT is \npreferred over 3 -D conformal RT in the treatment of anal carcinoma.193 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-16 \nIMRT requires expertise and careful target design to avoid reduction in \nlocal control by marginal miss.116 The clinical target volumes for anal \ncancer used in the RTOG 0529 trial have been described in detail.193 \nAlso see \nhttps://www.nrgoncology.org/Portals/0/Scientific%20Program/CIRO/Atla\nses/AnorectalContouringGuidelines.pdf  for more details of the \ncontouring atlas defined by RTOG.  \nFor individuals with previously untreated anal cancer who  present with \nsynchronous local and metastatic disease, chemoRT to the primary site \ncan be considered for local control following first -line chemotherapy, as \ndescribed in these guidelines. For recurrence in the primary site or \nnodes after previous chemoRT, surgery should be performed if \npossible, and, if not, palliative chemoRT can be considered based on \nsymptoms, extent of recurrence, and prior treatment.  \nSurgical Management  \nLocal excision is used for anal cancer in two situations. The first is for \nsuperficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SISCCA), which is \ndefined as anal cancer that has been completely excised, with ≤3-mm \nbasement membrane invasion and a maximal horizontal spread of ≤7 \nmm (T1,NX).194 SISCCA are generally found incidentally in the setting of \na biopsy or excision of what is thought to be a benign lesion such as a \ncondyloma, hemorrhoid, or anal skin tag. Such lesions are being seen \nwith increasing frequency because anal cancer screening in high -risk \npopulations is becoming more common. For SISCCA that are noted to \nhave histologically negative margins in carefully selected patients \nfollowed by an experienced provider and/or team, local excision alone \nwith a structured surveillance plan may  represent adequate treatment. A \ncareful surveillance plan is necessary as observational studies have \nreported detection of HSIL in 74% of patients following local excision.195 \nA retrospective study described characteristics , treatment, and outcomes of 17 patients with completely excised invasive anal cancer, \nseven of whom met the criteria for classification as superficially \ninvasive.196 Those with positive margins ( ≤2 mm for anal canal cancer \nand <1 cm for perianal cancer) received local radiation, and all patients \nunderwent surveillance. After a median follow -up of 45 months, no \ndifferences were seen in 5 -year OS (100% for the entire cohort) or 5 -\nyear cancer recurren ce-free survival rates (87% for the entire cohort) \nbetween the superficially invasive and invasive groups.   \nLocal excision is also used for T1,N0, well -differentiated or select T2,N0 \nperianal (anal margin) cancer that does not involve the sphincter (also \nsee Recommendations for the Primary Treatment of Perianal Cancer , \nbelow). In these cases, a 1 -cm margin is recommended. A retrospective \ncohort study that included  2243 adults  from the National Cancer \nData base diagnosed with  T1,N0 anal canal cancer between 2004  and \n2012  found that the use of local excision in this population increased \nover time ( 17.3% in 2004 to 30.8% in 2012; P < .001 ).197 No significant  \ndifference in 5 -year OS  was seen based on management strategy \n(85.3% for local excision ; 86.8% for chemoRT ; P = .93).  Many patients \nwith T1 or selected T2 perianal cancers will have concomitant HSIL of \nthe anal canal, therefore it is important to look for such anal canal \ninvolvement when conservative management (local excision) is being \nconsidered.  \nRadical surgery in anal cancer (APR) is reserved for local recurrence or \ndisease persistence (see Treatment of Locally Progressive or Recurrent \nAnal Carcinoma , below).  \nTreatment of Anal Cancer in People  with HIV/AIDS  \nAs discussed above ( see Risk Factors ), PWH have been reported to be \nat increased risk for anal carcinoma.18,28 -31 Some evidence suggests \nthat ART may be associated with a decrease in the incidence of high -\ngrade AIN and its progression to anal cancer .35,198 However, the PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-17 \nincidence of anal cancer in PWH  has not decreased much, if at all, over \ntime.27,29,31,34 \nMost evidence regarding outcomes in PWH with anal cancer comes \nfrom retrospective comparisons, a few of which found worse outcomes  \nin PWH.199-201 For example, a cohort comparison of 40 PWH  with anal \ncanal cancer and 81  patients who were  HIV-negative with anal canal \ncancer found local relapse rates to be four times higher in PWH at 3 \nyears (62% vs. 13%) and found significantly higher rates of severe \nacute skin toxicity for PWH.200 However, no differences in rates of \ncomplete response or 5 -year OS were observed between the groups in \nthat study. Another systematic review and meta -analysis of 40 studies \nincluding 3720 patients with localized squamous cell carcinoma of the \nanus who wer e treated with chemoRT, 34% of whom were HIV -positive, \nfound a greater risk of grade 3 and higher cutaneous toxicities (RR = \n1.34), and worse 3 -year DFS (RR = 1.32) and OS (RR = 1.77) rates, in \nPWH compared to those who were HIV -negative.201 \nMost studies, however, have found outcomes to be similar in PWH and \nindividuals who were HIV-negative.202-209 In a retrospective cohort study \nof 1184 veterans diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the anus \nbetween 1998 and 2004 (15% of whom tested positive for HIV), no \ndifferences with respect to receipt of treatment or 2 -year survival rates \nwere observed whe n the group of PWH was compared with the group of \npatients testing negative for HIV.204 Another study of 36 consecutive \npatients with anal cancer including 19 immunocompetent and 17 \npatients who were immunodeficient (14 PWH) showed no difference in \nthe efficacy or toxicity of chemoRT.208 A population -based study of \nalmost 2 million individuals with cancer, including 6459  PWH,  found no \nincrease in cancer -specific mortality for anal cancer  in PWH.210 \nAlthough the numbers of PWH in these studies have been small, the \nefficacy and safety results appear similar regardless of HIV status.  Overall, the Panel believes that PWH who have anal cancer should be \ntreated as per these guidelines and that m odifications to treatment  of \nanal cancer should not be made solely based on  HIV status . Additional \nconsiderations for PWH who have anal cancer are outlined in the NCCN \nGuidelines for Cancer in People with HIV  (available at www.NCCN.org ), \nincluding the use of normal tissue -sparing radiation techniques, the \nconsideration of n on-malignant causes for lymphadenopathy , and the \nneed for more frequent post -treatment surveillance anoscopy for PWH . \nPoor performance status in PWH and anal cancer may be from HIV, \ncancer, or other causes. The reason for poor performance status should \nbe considered when making treatment decisions. Treatment with ART \nmay improve poor performance status related to HIV.  \nRecommendations  for the Primary Treatment of Anal Canal Cancer  \nCurrently, concurrent chemoRT is the recommended primary treatment \nfor patients with non -metastatic anal canal cancer as well as for patients \nwith positive para -aortic lymph nodes that can be included in the \nradiation field, although only limited retrospec tive data support use in \nthis setting.211 Mitomycin/5 -FU or mitomycin/capecitabine is \nadministered concurrently with radiation.100,139 -141 Alternatively, 5 -\nFU/cisplatin can be given with concurrent radiation (category 2B).212 \nMost studies have delivered 5 -FU as a protracted 96 - to 120 -hour \ninfusion during the first and fifth weeks of RT, and bolus injection of \nmitomycin is typically given on the first or second day of the 5 -FU \ninfusion.83 Capecitabine is given orally, Monday through Friday, on each \nday that RT is given, for 4 or 6 weeks, with bolus injection of mitomycin \nand concurrent radiation.139,141 \nAn analysis of the National Cancer Data base found that only 61.5% of \npatients with stage I anal canal cancer received chemoRT as \nrecommended in these guidelines.213 Patients who were male , age d ≥70 \nyears , had small er or low er-grade tumors, or who had been evaluated PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-18 \nat academic facilities  were more likely than others to be treated with \nexcision alone. In a separate analysis of the National Cancer Data base, \n88% of patients with stage II/III anal canal cancer received chemoRT.214 \nMales, Black patients, those with multiple comorbidities, and those \ntreated in academic facilities were less likely to receive combined \nmodality treatment.  \nRT is associated with significant side effects. Patients should be \ncounseled on infertility risks and given information regarding sperm, \noocyte, egg, or ovarian tissue banking prior to treatment. In addition, \npatients should be considered for vaginal dilat ors and should be \ninstructed on the symptoms of vaginal stenosis.   \nRecommendations for the Primary Treatment of Perianal Cancer  \nPerianal lesions can be treated with either local excision or chemoRT \ndepending on the clinical stage. Primary treatment for patients with \nT1,N0 well -differentiated or select smaller T2,N0 perianal (anal margin) \ncancer that does not involve the sphincter i s by local excision with \nadequate margins . The ASCRS defines an adequate margin as 1 cm.60 \nIf the margins are not adequate, re -excision is the preferred treatment \noption. Local RT with or without continuous infusion 5 -FU/mitomycin, \nmitomycin/capecitabine, or 5-FU/cisplatin (category 2B)  can be \nconsidered as alternative treatment options when surgical margins are \ninadequate. For all other perianal cancers, the treatment options are the \nsame as for anal canal cancer (see above).100,139 -141,212 \nSurveillance Following  Primary Treatment  \nFollowing primary treatment of non -metastatic anal cancer, the \nsurveillance and follow -up treatment recommendations for perianal and \nanal canal cancer are the same. Patients are re -evaluated by DRE \nbetween 8 and 12 weeks after completion of chemoRT. Following re -\nevaluation, patients are classified according to whether they have a complete remission of disease, persistent disease, or progressive \ndisease. Patients with persistent disease but without evidence of \nprogression may be managed with close follow -up (in 4 weeks) to see if \nfurther regression occurs.  \nThe National Cancer Research Institute’s ACT II study compared \ndifferent chemoRT regimens and found no difference  in OS or PFS.143 \nInterestingly, 72% of patients in this trial who did not show a complete \nresponse at 11 weeks from the start of treatment had achieved a \ncomplete response by 26 weeks. 5 -year survival was superior in \npatients who achieved complete response at 26 weeks.215 Based on \nthese results, the Panel believes it may be appropriate to follow patients \nwho have not achieved a complete clinical response with persistent anal \ncancer for up to 6 months after completion of radiation and \nchemotherapy, as long as there is no evidence of progressive disease \nduring this period of follow -up. Persistent disease may continue to \nregress for up to 6 months from the start of treatment, and APR can \nthereby be avoided in some patients. In these patients, observation and \nre-evaluation shou ld be performed at 3 -month intervals. The Panel \nrecommends against the use of FDG -PET/CT imaging as part of this re -\nevaluation strategy due to concerns for false -positivity from local \ninflammation from RT leading to unnecessary surgeries. If biopsy -\nproven disease progression occurs, further intensive treatment is \nindicated (see Treatment of Locally Progressive or Recurrent Anal \nCarcinoma , below ).  \nAlthough a clinical assessment of progressive disease requires \nhistologic confirmation, patients can be classified as having a complete \nremission without biopsy verification if clinical evidence of disease is \nabsent. The Panel recommends that these patients undergo evaluation \nevery 3 to 6 months for 5 years, including DRE and inguinal node \npalpation.

Annual chest, abdomen , and pelvis CT with contrast or \nchest CT without contrast and abdomen /pelvis MRI with contrast is \nrecommended for 3 years for patients who initially had stage II –III \ndisease .  \nTreatment of Locally Progressive or Recurrent Anal Carcinoma  \nDespite the effectiveness of chemoRT in the primary treatment of anal \ncarcinoma, rates of locoregional failure of 10% to 30% have been \nreported.216,217 Some of the disease characteristics that have been \nassociated with higher recurrence rates following chemoRT include \nhigher T stage and higher N stage (also see the section on Prognostic \nFactors , above).218 \nEvidence of progression found on DRE should be followed by biopsy as \nwell as restaging with CT and/or FDG -PET/CT imaging. Patients with \nbiopsy -proven locally progressive disease are candidates for radical \nsurgery with an APR and colostomy.217 In an attempt to avoid surgery, \nthe use of immunotherapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab may be \nconsidered prior to APR (category 2B) as some patients may have a \ngood response, however it should be noted that this approach is based \non institutional experi ence only and there are currently no published \ndata supporting its use in this setting of otherwise curative intent \nsurgery.  \nA multicenter retrospective cohort study looked at the cause -specific \ncolostomy rates in 235 patients with anal cancer who were treated with \nradiotherapy or chemoRT  from 1995 to 2003 .219 The 5 -year cumulative \nincidence rates for tumor -specific and therapy -specific colostomy were \n26% (95% CI, 21 –32) and 8% (95% CI, 5 –12), respectively. Larger \ntumor size (>6 cm) was a risk factor for tumor -specific colostomy, while \nlocal excision prior to radiotherapy was a risk factor for therapy -specific \ncolostomy. However, it should be noted that these patients were treated with older chemotherapy and RT regimens, which could account for \nthese high colostomy rates.220 \nIn studies involving a minimum of 25 patients undergoing an APR for \nanal carcinoma, 5 -year survival rates of 39% to 66% have been \nobserved.216,217,221 -225 Complication rates were reported to be high in \nsome of these studies. Factors associated with worse prognosis \nfollowing APR include an initial presentation of node -positive disease \nand RT doses <55 Gy used in the treatment of primary disease.217  \nThe general principles for APR technique are similar to those for distal \nrectal cancer and include the incorporation of meticulous total \nmesorectal excision (TME). However, APR for anal cancer may require \nwider lateral perianal margins than are required fo r rectal cancer. A \nretrospective analysis of the medical records of 14 individuals who \nreceived intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) during APR revealed \nthat IORT is unlikely to improve local control or to give a survival \nbenefit.226 \nBecause of the necessary exposure of the perineum to radiation, \nindividuals with anal cancer are prone to poor perineal wound healing. It \nhas been shown that for patients undergoing an APR that was \npreceded by RT, closure of the perineal wound using rectus abdominis \nmyocutaneous flap reconstruction results in decreased perineal wo und \ncomplications.227,228 Reconstructive tissue flaps for the perineum, such \nas the vertical rectus or local myocutaneous flaps, should therefore be \nconsidered for patients with anal cancer undergoing an APR.   \nInguinal node dissection is recommended for recurrence in that area \nand for patients who require an APR  but have already received groin \nradiation . Inguinal node dissection  can be performed with or without an \nAPR depending on whether disease is isolated to the groin or has PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

Radiation therapy technique and doses a re dependent on dosing \nand technique of prior treatment (see the guidelines above). If RT was \ngiven previously, 5 -FU/cisplatin chemotherapy may be given (category \n2B). \nSurveillance Following Treatment of Recurrence  \nFollowing APR, patients should undergo re -evaluation every 3 to 6 \nmonths for 5 years, including clinical evaluation for nodal metastasis (ie, \ninguinal node palpation). In addition, it is recommended that these \npatients undergo annual chest, abdomen , and pelvis CT with contrast or \nchest CT without contrast and abdomen /pelvis MRI with contrast for 3 \nyears . In one retrospective study of 105 patients with anal canal \ncarcinoma who had an APR between 1996 and 2009 , the overall \nrecurrence rate following APR was 43 %.229 Those with T3/4 tumors or \ninvolved margins were more likely to experience recurrence. The 5 -year \nsurvival rate after APR has been reported to be 60% to 64%.229,230 \nFollowing treatment of inguinal node recurrence, patients should have a \nDRE and inguinal node palpation every 3 to 6 months for 5 years. In \naddition, anoscopy every 6 to 12 months and annual chest, abdomen , \nand pelvis CT with contrast or chest CT without contrast and \nabdomen /pelvis MRI with contrast are recommended for 3 years.  \nTreatment of Metastatic Anal Cancer  \nIt has been reported that the most common sites of anal cancer \nmetastasis outside of the pelvis are the liver, lung, and extrapelvic \nlymph nodes.231 Since anal carcinoma is a rare cancer and only 10% to 20% of individuals with anal carcinoma present with extrapelvic \nmetastatic disease,231 only limited data are available on this population \nof patients. Despite this fact, evidence indicates that systemic therapy \nhas some benefit in individuals  with metastatic anal carcinoma.  \nPalliative chemoRT to the primary site can be administered following \nupfront chemotherapy for local control of a symptomatic bulky primary.  \nIn fact, an analysis of the National Cancer Database reported that \nindividuals with newly diagnosed metastatic anal cancer who received \ndefinitive pelvic RT in addition to chemotherapy had longer median OS \nthan those who received chemotherapy alone (21.3 vs. 15.9 months; \nHR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61 –0.81; P < .001).232 A retrospective analysis of \n106 patients with squamous cell carcinoma reported that resection or \nablation of liver metastases can result in long -term survival and that \nindividuals with anal cancer had better outcomes than those with non -\nanal squamous cell carcinoma, although this approach is not currently \nincluded in the NCCN Guidelines® for Anal Carcinoma.233 \nFirst -Line Treatment of Metastatic Anal Cancer  \nRecent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of  checkpoint inhibitors \nin combination with chemotherapy for  first-line treatment of metastatic \nanal cancer.  The phase 3 global study  POD1UM -303/InterAACT2 \n(NCT04472429) is investigating the addition of the checkpoint inhibitor, \nretifanlimab, to the chemotherapy of choice in this study  \n(carboplatin /paclitaxel ) and comparing it to chemotherapy  alone.234 This \ntrial is expected to be completed  in 2026, but preliminary results show \nthat the primary endpoint was met, with an improved  median PFS in \npatients treated with chemotherapy and retifanlimab compared to those \ntreated with chemotherapy alone (9.30 [95% CI, 7.5 –11.3] and 7.39 \nmonths [95% CI, 7.1 –7.7], respectively; HR = 0.63; P = .0006).

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-21 \nretifanlimab versus 23.0 months (95% CI , 15.1–27.9)  for patients that \ndid not have retifanlimab in their c ombination  treatment. Based on these \ndata, the Panel has added carboplatin/paclitaxel with retifanlimab as the \npreferred regimen for first -line treatment of metastatic anal cancer. \nSimilarly, NCT04444921  is a randomized, phase 3 trial comparing \nchemotherapy alone (carboplatin and paclitaxel) to chemotherapy plus \nnivolumab for treatment -naïve metastatic anal cancer.235 This study has \n205 participants and is expected to complete in 202 6, therefore this \ncombination regimen  is not currently listed in th ese guidelines.  \nThe combination regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel was initially \nresearched in t he phase II International Multicentre InterAACT study.236 \nIn this trial, 91 patients with previously untreated, unresectable, locally \nrecurrent or metastatic anal squamous cell carcinoma were randomized \nto either carboplatin plus paclitaxel or cisplatin plus 5 -FU. While \nresponse rates were similar between carbop latin plus paclitaxel and \ncisplatin plus 5 -FU (59% and 57%, respectively), carboplatin plus \npaclitaxel showed lower toxicity compared to cisplatin plus 5 -FU (71% \nvs. 76% grade ≥3 toxicity and 36% vs. 62% [ P = .016] serious adverse \nevents). Median PFS and O S were 8.1 months and 20 months for \ncarboplatin plus paclitaxel and 5.7 months and 12.3 months for cisplatin \nplus 5 -FU (HR for OS, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.15 –3.47; P = .014).236 The results \nfrom the InterAACT trial are in agreement with older studies that \nshowed that chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine -based regimen plus \ncisplatin212,237 -239 or a platinum -based therapy plus paclitaxel238,240,241 \nbenefited some patients with metastatic anal carcinoma.  Due to the \ncurrent results of the PODIUM 303/InterAACT2 study showing improved \nPFS with addition of retifanlimab, the Panel has added carboplatin and \npaclitaxel as other recommended regimen for first -line treatment of \nmetastatic anal cancer, with the reti fanlimab combination being \npreferred.  Other recommended treatment options include 5 -FU, leucovorin, and \ncisplatin (FOLFCIS); 5 -FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX); 5 -FU \nplus cisplatin (category 2B reflecting its similar efficacy, but higher \ntoxicity, when compared to carboplatin plus pacl itaxel in a randomized \ntrial); or modified docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5 -FU (DCF, category 2B). A \nretrospective study of 53 patients with advanced anal squamous cell \ncarcinoma who received FOLFCIS as first -line therapy showed that this \nregimen was safe and e ffective in this patient population. The response \nrate was 48%, PFS was 7.1 months, and OS was 22.1 months.242 The \nsafety of FOLFOX in individuals with anal cancer has been \ndemonstrated in a case report.243 Despite the limited data for FOLFOX \nin this setting, the Panel added it based on consensus and its current \nuse as a standard option at many NCCN Member Institutions.  With use \nof FOLFOX, the Panel recommends strong consideration of \ndiscontinuation of oxaliplatin after 3 to 4 months (or sooner for \nunacceptable neurotoxicity) while maintaining other agents until time of \ndisease progression.244 Oxaliplatin may be reintroduced if it was \ndiscontinued for neurotoxicity rather than for disease progression.   \nDCF is another regimen that has been evaluated for metastatic anal \ncancer.245,246 A single -arm phase II trial evaluated this regimen in \nindividuals with previously untreated, advanced anal squamous cell \ncarcinoma. This trial demonstrated the efficacy of DCF (both standard \nand modified regimens) in this setting and reported better toler ability of \nmodified DCF compared to the standard regimen.245 The median PFS \nwas 10.7 months for the standard DCF regimen and 11.0 months for the \nmodified regimen.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-22 \nthe category 2B designation reflecting concerns voiced by some Panel \nmembers about potentially higher toxicity with modified DCF compared \nto the other regimens recommended for metastatic anal cancer.  \nSecond -Line Treatment of Metastatic  Anal Cancer  \nA single -arm, multicenter phase 2 trial  assessed the safety and efficacy \nof the anti -PD-1 antibody nivolumab for refractory metastatic anal \ncancer.247 Two complete responses and seven partial responses  were \nseen among the 37 enrolled participants who received at least one \ndose, for a response rate of 24% ( 95% CI , 15–33). The KEYNOTE -028 \ntrial is a multi -cohort, phase 1b trial of the anti -PD-1 antibody \npembrolizumab  in 24 patients with programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD-\nL1)–positive  advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the anal  canal.248 \nFour partial responses were seen, for a response rate of 17 % (95%  CI, \n5–37), and 10 patients  (42%) had stable disease, for a disease control \nrate of 58% . In both trials, toxicities were manageable, with 13% and \n17% experiencing grade 3 adverse events with nivolumab and \npembrolizumab, respectively.247,248 The phase II KEYNOTE -158 study \ninvestigated the use of pembrolizumab in individuals  with noncolorectal \nmicrosatellite instability -high (MSI -H)/ deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) \ncancers, including patients with anal cancer (cohort A).249,250 A total of \n112 patients with anal cancer were enrolled and treated, 67% of whom \nhad PD -L1-positive disease.250 A total of 11% of patients (95% CI, 6 –\n18) had an objective response, with responses in 15% (95% CI, 8 –25) \nof patients with PD -L1-positive disease and in 3% (95% CI, 0 –17) with \nPD-L1-negative disease. Serious treatment -related adverse events \nwere noted in 11% of patients, with 25% of patients having immune -\nmediated events. This study demonstrated the clinical benefit of \npembrolizumab for individuals  with previously treated advanced anal \nsquamous cell  carcinoma .  The phase 2 PODIUM -202 trial investigated  retifanlimab  as a second -\nline agent  for advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the \nanal canal that progressed following platinum -based chemotherapy.251 \nThe primary endpoint was overall rate response (ORR) and second ary \nendpoints were  duration of response (DOR) , PFS and OS  in the 94 \nenrolled patients. At a median follow -up of 7.1 months, the ORR was \n13.8% (95% CI, 7.6 %–22.5%) with one patient having a complete \nresponse, and 12 receiving  partial responses. Additionally, the median \nDOR was 9.5 months , and the median PFS and OS were 2.3 months \n(95% CI, 1.9 –3.6) and  10.1 (95% CI, 7.9 –NE), respectively.  Based on \nthese data, the Panel recommend s retifanlimab as a treatment option \nfor second -line and subsequent therapy for advanced or metastatic \nsquamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal.  Another  phase 2 clinical \ntrial (NCT02314169) is underway investigating the efficacy and safety of  \nnivolumab, with or without ipilimumab, for patients with refractory \nmetastatic anal canal cancer.252 This trial has an enrollment of 37 \nparticipants  and is expected to complete in March 2026 . Other \ncheckpoint inhibitor immunotherapy agents such as: cemiplimab -rwlc, \ndostarlimab -gxly, tislelizumab -jsgr, and toripalimab -tpzi are also \nrecommended by the Panel  based on  extrapolat ion from colon and \nrectal cancers . However , there are no current studies of these agents in \nanal cancer . \nAlthough further studies of PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors are warranted, the \nPanel added nivolumab , pembrolizumab , cemiplimab -rwlc, dostarlimab -\ngxly, tislelizumab -jsgr, and toripalimab -tpzi as preferred options for \nindividuals with metastatic anal cancer who have progressed on first -\nline chemotherapy. Microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatch repair \n(MMR) testing is not required. MSI is uncommon in anal cancer,253 and \nas discussed above, responses to PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors occur in 20% \nto 24% of patients.247,248 Anal cancers may be responsive to PD -1/PD -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:18:06 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2025 \nAnal Carcinoma  \n \nMS-23 \nL1 inhibitors because they often have high PD -L1 expression and/or a \nhigh tumor mutational load despite being microsatellite stable (MSS).253 \nThe Panel includes chemotherapy agents as options in second  line \ntherapy if not previously given  in first  line, but also notes that platinum -\nbased chemotherapy should not be given in second line if disease \nprogressed on platinum -based therapy in first line.  \nSurvivorship  \nThe Panel recommends that a prescription for survivorship and transfer \nof care to the primary care physician be written.254 The oncologist and \nprimary care provider should have defined roles in the surveillance \nperiod, with roles communicated to the patient.  The care plan should \ninclude an overall summary of treatments received, including surgeries, \nradiation treatments, and chemotherapy. The possible expected time to \nresolution of acute toxicities, long -term effects of treatment, and \npossible late sequelae of treatment  should be described. Finally, \nsurveillance  and health behavior recommendations should be part of \nthe care pla n. \nDisease -preventive measures, such as immunizations; early disease \ndetection through periodic screening for second primary cancers (eg, \nbreast, cervical, prostate cancers); and routine good medical care and \nmonitoring are recommended (see the NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship , available at www.NCCN.org ). Additional health monitoring \nshould be performed as indicated under the care of a primary care \nphysician. Survivors are encouraged to maintain a therapeutic \nrelationship with a primary care physician throughout their lifetime.255 \nOther recommendations include monitoring for late sequelae of anal \ncancer or the treatment of anal cancer . Late toxicity from pelvic \nradiation can include bowel dysfunction (ie, increased stool frequency, \nfecal incontinence, flatulence, rectal urgency), urinary dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction (ie, impotence, dyspareunia, vaginal stenosis, \nvaginal dryness, reduced libido).256-260 Anal cancer survivors also report \nsignificantly reduced global quality of life, with increased frequency of \nsomatic symptoms  including fatigue, dyspnea, nausea, appetite loss, \npain, and insomnia.256,260 -262 Therefore, survivors of anal cancer should \nbe screened regularly for distress.  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship  (available at www.NCCN.org ) \nprovide screening, evaluation, and treatment recommendations for \ncommon consequences of cancer and cancer treatment to aid health \ncare professionals who work with survivors of adult -onset cancer in the \npost-treatment period, including those in specialty ca ncer survivor \nclinics and primary care practices. The se guidelines include many \ntopics with potential relevance to survivors of anal cancer, including \nanxiety, depression, and distress; cognitive dysfunction; fatigue; pain; \nsexual dysfunction; sleep disord ers; h ealthy lifestyles; and \nimmunizations. Concerns related to employment, insurance, and \ndisability are also discussed.   \nSummary  \nThe NCCN Anal Carcinoma Guidelines Panel believes that a \nmultidisciplinary approach including physicians from gastroenterology, \nmedical oncology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and radiology \nis necessary for treating individuals  with anal carcinoma.  \nRecommendations for the primary treatment of perianal  cancer and anal \ncanal cancer are very similar and include chemoRT  in most cases. The \nexception is small, well  or moderately differentiated perianal  lesions  and \nsuperficially invasive lesions , which can be treated with margin -negative \nlocal excision alone. Follow -up clinical evaluations are recommended \nfor all individuals  with anal carcinoma because  additional curative -intent \ntreatment  is possible.
