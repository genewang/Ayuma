If patient is a potential transplant candidate, consider \nreferral to transplant center before biopsy. Importantly, transperitoneal and surgical biopsy may be contraindicated in transplant candidates.  \nUnresectable perihilar or hilar CCAs that measure ≤3 cm in radial diameter , with the absence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic metastases and without \nnodal disease, as well as those with primary sclerosing cholangitis, may be considered for liver transplantation at a transplant center that has an UNOS-\napproved protocol for transplantation of CCA.\nBiliary Tract Cancers\nBIL-A\n• Gallbladder Cancer, bullet 2 revised: If gallbladder cancer is suspected preoperatively, multidetector  multiphase CT of the abdomen (and pelvis) or \ncontrast-enhanced MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of the abdomen (and pelvis) and chest CT with or without contrast \nshould be performed. MRI is preferred for evaluating masses within the gallbladder and demonstrating bile duct involvement.\n• Biliary Drainage, bullets added: \n\u0017Multidisciplinary discussion of drainage is recommended, especially in patients with potentially resectable disease. \n\u0017Route (percutaneous vs. endoscopic) should be considered based on local expertise after multidisciplinary review.\n\u0017All segments that are opacified should be drained, with the aim to drain >50% of the viable liver volume, including the future liver remnant. Atrophic \nliver segments, in general, should not be drained.\nBIL-B (6 of 8)\n• HER2/ERBB2 Overexpression/Amplification/Activating Mutations\n\u0017Bullet 1 revised: Testing Modalities and Considerations: HER2 overexpression /amplification...PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

If there is a suspicious \nmass, a biopsy is not necessary as this can result in peritoneal dissemination.\n• If expertise is available and there is convincing clinical evidence of cancer , a definitive resectiona can be performed as written below. \nIf the diagnosis is not clear, frozen section biopsies can be considered in selected cases before proceeding with definitive resection. If \nmalignancy is suspected or confirmed after cholecystectomy has been initiated and expertise is available, then definitive resection should \nbe undertaken.\n• If malignancy is suspected before cholecystectomy has begun and there is a question of resectability (ie, locally advanced, possible \nmetastatic disease, other), then definitive resection can be postponed, regardless of available expertise, until complete staging and \nevaluation has been performed. Document all findings and consider biopsya if chemotherapy is anticipated.\n• The principles of resection are the same as below consisting of radical cholecystectomy including segments IV B and V and \nlymphadenectomy and extended hepatic or biliary resection as necessary to obtain a negative margin.\n• Consider neoadjuvant systemic therapy for locoregionally advanced disease to rule out rapid progression and avoid futile surgery (biopsy \nrequired). \n• Minimally invasive approaches by experienced surgeons have been proven to be safe and effective for well-selected cases.\nIncidental Finding on Pathologic Review :\n• Consider pathologic re-review by a hepatobiliary pathology experta and/or speak to surgeon to check for completeness of cholecystectomy, \nsigns of disseminated disease, location of tumor, and any other pertinent information. Review the pathology report for T stage, cystic duct \nmargin status, and other margins.\n• Diagnostic laparoscopy can be performed but is of relatively low yield. Higher yields may be seen in patients with T3 or higher tumors, \npoorly differentiated tumors, or with a margin-positive cholecystectomy . Diagnostic laparoscopy should also be considered in patients with \nany suspicion of metastatic disease on imaging that is not amenable to percutaneous biopsy.1\n• Repeat cross-sectional imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed prior to definitive resection.\n• Initial exploration should rule out distant lymph node metastases in the celiac axis or aorto-caval groove as these contraindicate further \nresection.\n• Hepatic resectiona should be performed to obtain clear margins, which usually consists of segments IV B and V. Extended resections \nbeyond segments IV B and V may be needed in some patients to obtain negative margins.\n• Lymphadenectomy should be performed to clear all lymph nodes in the porta hepatis. \n• Resection of the bile duct may be needed to obtain negative margins. Routine resection of the bile duct for lymphadenectomy has been \nshown to increase morbidity without convincing evidence for improved survival.2,3 \n• Port site resection has not been shown to be effective, as the presence of a port site implant is a surrogate marker of underlying \ndisseminated disease and has not been shown to improve outcomes.4\n• Consider neoadjuvant systemic therapy for locoregionally advanced disease to rule out rapid progression and avoid futile surgery .PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY\n1 Butte JM, Gonen M, Allen PJ, et al.

While major resections are often necessary, wedge resections and \nsegmental resections are all appropriate given that a negative margin can be achieved.\n• A regional lymphadenectomy of the porta hepatis is carried out.\n• Multifocal liver disease is generally representative of metastatic disease and is a contraindication to resection. In highly selected cases with \nlimited multifocal disease resection can be considered.\n• Gross lymph node metastases to the porta hepatis portend a poor prognosis and resection should only be considered in highly selected \ncases.\n• Minimally invasive approaches by experienced surgeons have been proven to be safe and effective for well-selected cases.\n1 Endo I, Gonen M, Yopp A.

Next-generation sequencing of mixed HCC-CCA suggests \na higher prevalence of genomic aberrations more commonly associated with HCC than CCA (such as presence of TP53 and TERT promoter \nmutations), particularly in patients with underlying hepatitis C virus infection, but interpretation of these results is limited by small sample \nsizes.3,5\nLiver resection is considered the standard treatment for resectable mixed HCC-CCA.6 Though prospective data are lacking, liver-directed local \ntherapies may be appropriate for patients with a limited extent of unresectable hepatic disease, similar to management algorithms for HCC \nand intrahepatic CCA (See NCCN Guidelines for Hepatocellular Carcinoma and INTRA-1). \nPatients with HCC-CCA that is limited in size based on center-specific criteria used should be considered for evaluation in a transplant center.  \nIn patients with metastatic or locally-advanced recurrence after a prior resection or local therapies for mixed HCC-CCA, a repeat biopsya \nshould be considered to ascertain the dominant histology at recurrence. If the biopsy at recurrence suggests an isolated recurrence of either \nthe HCC or CCA component, the Panel would consider a systemic therapy option appropriate for that histologic component.\nTumor molecular profiling should be considered in all patients with advanced stages of mixed HCC-CCA tumors to identify potential targetable \naberrations, which may be associated with CCA (BIL-B, BIL-C).\nFor patients with histologic evidence of mixed HCC-CCA at advanced stages requiring systemic therapy, there are limited prospective data to \nguide the choice of regimen. A retrospective series of 101 patients with mixed HCC-CCA treated with systemic therapy demonstrated similar \noverall response rates for patients treated with chemotherapy versus non-chemotherapy-based systemic therapies; there was a trend towards \nlonger median overall survival in patients treated with chemotherapy (15.5 vs. 5.3 months; P = .052).7 Based upon these data as well as the \npotential for activity of component parts in both histologies, a regimen of gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy combined with either \ndurvalumab or pembrolizumab immunotherapy is an appropriate choice for first-line therapy , noting that these combinations include agents \nwith anti-tumor activity in both CCA8-10 and HCC histologies.11-14 At progression, molecularly-targeted therapies should be considered if \nthe tumor harbors a targetable aberration. In the absence of a targetable aberration, regimens with demonstrated activity in both HCC and \nCCA are reasonable options, including the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab15,16 or regorafenib.17,18 A repeat biopsy at tumor \nprogression may be warranted to reassess dominant histology of a progressing lesion, especially if there are discordant areas of response \nand progression and if the patient remains a candidate for further systemic therapy.PRINCIPLES OF MIXED HCC-CCA\nINTRA-B\n1 OF 2a Principles of Pathology ( INTRA-C).

Locoregional treatment may \nbe considered in patients who are not candidates for surgical curative therapies or to downstage for other treatments.1 Locoregional therapies are broadly \ncategorized into ablation, arterially directed therapies, and RT. \nAblation\n•  All tumors should be amenable to complete ablation so that the tumor and a margin of normal tissue up to 1 cm can be treated.\n•  For small single tumors <3 cm, whether recurrent or primary, thermal ablation is a reasonable alternative to surgical resection, particularly in patients with \nhigh-risk disease.2-4 \n• Options for ablation include radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and irreversible electroporation.  \nArterially directed therapies\n• Hepatic tumors may be amenable to arterially directed therapies provided the supply to tumor may be isolated without excessive non-target treatment.\n• Select patients with limited extrahepatic disease (hilar lymph node ≤3 cm or ≤5 lung nodules each ≤1 cm) may be considered for arterially directed therapy \nin combination with systemic therapy. \n• Arterially directed therapies include transarterial embolization, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), TACE with drug-eluting beads, and Y90.5,6 \n•  Arterially directed therapies may be used alone or followed by systemic chemotherapy with the intention to prolong survival or downstage to curative \nresection.7,8 \n•  When treating with Y90, personalized dosimetry/radiation segmentectomy to achieve >205 Gy to tumor may improve outcome.9 \n•  Y90 is relatively contraindicated in patients with bilirubin >3 mg/dL. With well-selected patients, grade 3–4 hepatic toxicity occurs in <10% of patients, \nalthough this may be significantly higher in patients with cirrhosis.\n• Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (with or without systemic chemotherapy) may be used in a clinical trial or at experienced centers in carefully \nselected cases. \n1 Bridgewater J, Galle PR, Khan SA, et al.

This generally requires a \npancreaticoduodenectomy for distal bile duct tumors and a major hepatic resection for hilar tumors. Rarely, a mid bile duct tumor can be resected \nwith a bile duct resection and regional lymphadenectomy.\n• A preoperative biopsy is not always necessary before proceeding with a definitive, potentially curative resection. A suspicious mass on imaging in \nthe proper clinical setting should be treated as malignant. \n• Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered.\n• Occasionally a bile duct tumor will involve the biliary tree over a long distance such that a hepatic resection and pancreaticoduodenectomy will \nbe necessary. These are relatively morbid procedures and should only be carried out in very healthy patients without significant comorbidity. \nNonetheless, these can be potentially curative procedures and should be considered in the proper clinical setting. Combined liver and pancreatic \nresections performed to clear distant nodal disease are not recommended.\nHilar Cholangiocarcinoma\n• Detailed descriptions of imaging assessment of resectability are beyond the scope of this outline. The basic principle is that the tumor will need \nto be resected along with the involved biliary tree and the involved hemi-liver with a reasonable chance of a margin-negative resection. The \ncontralateral liver requires intact arterial and portal inflow as well as biliary drainage.1-3 \n• Detailed descriptions of preoperative surgical planning are beyond the scope of this outline but require an assessment of the future liver remnant \n(FLR). This requires an assessment of biliary drainage and volumetrics of the FLR. While not necessary in all cases, the use of preoperative biliary \ndrainage of the FLR and contralateral portal vein embolization should be considered in cases of a small FLR.4,5\n• Initial exploration rules out distant metastatic disease to the liver , peritoneum, or distant lymph nodes beyond the porta hepatis as these findings \ncontraindicate resection. Further exploration must confirm local resectability .\n• Since hilar tumors, by definition, abut or invade the central portion of the liver they require major hepatic resections on the involved side to \nencompass the biliary confluence and generally require a caudate resection.\n• Resection and reconstruction of the portal vein and/or hepatic artery may be necessary for complete resection and require expertise in these procedures.\n• Biliary reconstruction is generally through a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.\n• A regional lymphadenectomy of the porta hepatis is carried out. \n• Frozen section assessment of proximal and distal bile duct margins is recommended if further resection can be carried out.\nDistal Cholangiocarcinoma\n• Initial assessment is needed to rule out distant metastatic disease and local resectability.\n• The operation generally requires a pancreaticoduodenectomy with typical reconstruction.\nEXTRA-A1 Nishio H, Nagino M, Nimura Y.

Available \nat: https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/Practice-Parameters/MR-Liver.pdf. \nAccessed 01/18/22. \nBIL-AGeneral Principles\n• CT of the chest with or without contrast and multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis are recommended for \nfollow-up imaging.\n• PET/CT has limited sensitivity but high specificity and may be considered when there is an equivocal finding or on a case-by-case basis.5 \nThe routine use of PET/CT in the preoperative setting has not been established in prospective trials.\nGallbladder Cancer\n• Detection of early-stage gallbladder cancer remains difficult, and is commonly discovered incidentally at surgery or pathologic examination \nof the gallbladder.\n• If gallbladder cancer is suspected preoperatively, multiphase CT of the abdomen (and pelvis) or contrast-enhanced MRI with magnetic \nresonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) of the abdomen (and pelvis) and chest CT with or without contrast should be performed. MRI \nis preferred for evaluating masses within the gallbladder and demonstrating bile duct involvement.\n• Because lymphatic spread is common, careful attention should be made to evaluate nodal disease, specifically the porta hepatis and left \ngastric and aorto-caval basins. \nIntrahepatic6 and Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma\n• Surgical management is based on the location and extent of the tumor. \n• Preoperative imaging for accurate staging of extrahepatic CCA should be done with multidetector multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI. \nContrast-enhanced MRI with MRCP is preferred for evaluating the extent of biliary tract involvement. Imaging with multiphasic CT or MRI with \nthin cuts, or multiphase CT or MRI of the liver and biliary tree should specifically address the anatomy of the biliary tree, hepatic arteries, and \nportal veins and their relationship to the tumor.7\n• Chest CT with or without contrast is recommended for staging.\n• When biliary duct involvement is suspected, it is very important to obtain high-quality biliary protocol imaging (preferably CT) to evaluate the \nextent of tumor prior to stenting. Reactive changes from stenting could potentially compromise the ability to delineate the complete extent of \nbiliary tract involvement.\n• EUS or ERCP may be helpful in the setting of bile duct dilation if no mass is seen on CT or MRI. EUS or ERCP can also be used to establish \ntissue diagnosis and provide access to relieve biliary obstruction.\n• CT of the chest with or without contrast and CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast may be used for follow-up.\n• Delayed phase imaging is preferred when the diagnosis of intrahepatic CCA is suspected or confirmed.\nBiliary Drainage\n• Multidisciplinary discussion of drainage is recommended, especially in patients with potentially resectable disease. \n• Route (percutaneous vs. endoscopic) should be considered based on local expertise after multidisciplinary review.\n• All segments that are opacified should be drained, with the aim to drain >50% of the viable liver volume, including the future liver remnant. \nAtrophic liver segments, in general, should not be drained.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

Specifically , genotyping of the tumor tissue has identified \ntranslocations in FGFR2 and NTRK, mutations in the IDH1 and BRAF genes, and microsatellite instability (MSI) along with other rare \nmolecular alterations for which specific treatments are now available.1-22\n• Additionally, while most biliary tract carcinomas are considered sporadic, up to 10%–15% of BTCs may be associated with an inherited \ncancer predisposition syndrome.23,24 Recent studies have evaluated germline mutation testing in large cohorts of unselected patients with \nbiliary tract carcinoma and discovered high to moderate penetrance deleterious germline mutations in roughly 9% to 11% of BTCs, including \nintrahepatic/extrahepatic CCAs and gallbladder carcinomas.23,25 The highest prevalence was found for BRCA2  mutation followed by BRCA1  \nand to a lesser extent MLH1, MSH2, PALB2, RAD51D , BAP1, and ATM mutations.23,25,26 These findings are consistent with earlier literature \nsuggesting an increased risk of BTC in patients with BRCA  mutations and Lynch syndrome.27,28\nRecommendations\n• Molecular profiling in BTCs: Comprehensive molecular profiling is recommended for patients with unresectable or metastatic BTC who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy (see Table 1 and Table 2). A comprehensive panel including the targets listed in Table 1 may optimize the \nchance of identifying a targetable aberration. If tissue is too scant or not available, consider repeat biopsy depending on tumor accessibility , \nsafety, and clinical context. A cell-free DNA (cfDNA) test may also be considered for identifying gene mutations. This technique may not \nreliably identify gene fusions or rearrangements depending on the panel used and the specific partner gene. \n• Germline testing in hepatobiliary cancers: Evidence remains insufficient for definitive recommendations regarding specific criteria to guide \ngenetic risk assessment in hepatobiliary cancers or for universal germline testing in these tumors. In BTCs, genetic counseling referral \nand potential germline testing should be considered in patients with any of the following characteristics: young age at diagnosis; a strong \npersonal or family history of cancer; no known risk factors for liver disease; or presence of mutations identified during tumor testing that are \nsuspected to be possible germline alterations. For patients who harbor a known germline mutation associated with a cancer predisposing \nsyndrome (ie, Lynch syndrome or hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome), there is currently insufficient evidence to support \nscreening for biliary tract malignancies. Further recommendations and a detailed discussion of genetic counseling and testing can be found \nin the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate  and NCCN Guidelines for \nGenetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal, Endometrial, and Gastric.\nReferences on BIL-B 7 of 8PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

These assessments are feasible in the context of multi-target assessment in NGS gene panels currently in clinical \nuse and NTRK fusion-positive CCA have demonstrated responses in clinical trials.\nImmunotherapy Biomarkers (MSI-H/dMMR/TMB-H, PD-L1)\n• Testing Modalities and Considerations: There are three possible tests to evaluate mismatch repair (MMR) protein deficiency or microsatellite \nstatus. First, immunohistochemical staining for the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 gene products establishes protein retention or loss. \nIf all 4 proteins are retained, it is unlikely the sample will display high rates of DNA mutations in microsatellite regions. Loss of two of the \nfour proteins (typical in MLH1 /PMS2 and MSH2/MSH6 pairs) correlates with MSI or MSI-H. Second, NGS determines if there are inactivating \nmutations in the MMR genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Mutations associated with nonfunctional MMR proteins correlate with MSI-H \nstatus. Last, microsatellite repeats of tumor DNA are examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Abnormal microsatellites in two or more \nregions demonstrates MSI-H status. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) can be tested with a clinically validated NGS panel but has inherent \nplatform variation.\n• Recommendation: Testing for MSI or MMR deficiency is recommended in patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer, \nintrahepatic CCA, or extrahepatic CCA. \n• Testing for TMB is recommended for patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic CCA, or extrahepatic CCA \nbased upon clinical benefit observed across advanced solid tumors. \n• Further recommendations for MSI/MMR testing can be found in the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer .PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

NGS \ntesting offers the ability to assess numerous molecular alterations simultaneously and has the added benefit of detecting HER2 activating \nmutations. NGS can be considered upfront when limited diagnostic tissue is available, though other methodologies such as IHC/FISH remain \nthe most commonly utilized. However, the predominant limitation of HER2 or ERBB2  testing in hepatobiliary tumors is the lack of specific \nguideline cutoff points or standardized algorithms to define HER2 positivity by protein expression or ERBB2  amplification in hepatobiliary \nmalignancies. Various cutoff values including those described for breast and gastroesophageal junction neoplasms have been used in prior \nand ongoing clinical trials, making direct comparisons between studies difficult. Other challenges to be considered include the significant \nheterogeneity that can be seen with protein overexpression in BTCs, which may affect positivity rates when IHC is performed in biopsy \nspecimens.32 Lastly, while most alterations are identified through overexpression or amplification, activating missense mutations have also \nbeen shown to represent a significant subset of HER2-altered tumors, which will be missed with standard IHC and FISH techniques.13,33\n• Recommendation: Testing for HER2 (ERBB2 ) overexpression/amplification is recommended for patients with unresectable or metastatic \ngallbladder cancer, intrahepatic CCA, or extrahepatic CCA. \nOther Biomarkers (RET/ROS1, KRAS G12C/Other KRAS, Other Tumor-Agnostic Markers)\n• In addition to the genomic aberrations reviewed above, NGS testing may uncover other potentially actionable molecular alterations that \ncould determine eligibility for ongoing clinical trials in patients with advanced BTCs. While there is insufficient evidence to recommend \nuniversal assessment, alterations for which targeted therapies exist and have been FDA-approved in other tumor types, including KRAS \nG12C mutation,34-36 MET amplification,37-39 and ALK,40 RET,19 or ROS1 fusions,41 among others,42 have been described with variable but \noverall rare frequency in biliary tract carcinomas and hepatocellular carcinoma.43 However, limited data currently exist regarding the efficacy \nof targeted therapy in these situations, due to their rarity.\n• Recommendation: Testing for RET fusions is recommended for patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic \nCCA, or extrahepatic CCA. A comprehensive NGS panel may identify additional alterations for which targeted therapies exist and have FDA-\napproved treatments in other tumor types.\n• Recommendation: Testing for KRAS G12C mutations is recommended for patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer, \nintrahepatic CCA, or extrahepatic CCA.\nReferences on BIL-B 7 of 8PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBiliary Tract Cancers  \nMS-2  \nOverview \nGallbladder cancer and bile duct cancer (intrahepatic and extrahepatic \ncholangiocarcinoma [CCA]) are highly lethal cancers and are collectively \nknown as biliary tract cancers (BTCs). In 2025, it is estimated that 42,240 \npeople in the United States will be diagnosed with liver cancer including \nintrahepatic bile duct cancer and an additional 12,610 people will be \ndiagnosed with gallbladder cancer or other BTC.1 Approximately 30,090 \ndeaths from liver or intrahepatic bile duct cancer and 4400 deaths due to gallbladder cancer or other BTC are anticipated.  \nThe NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines\n®) \nfor Biliary Tract Cancers  are the work  of the members of the NCCN Biliary \nTract Cancers  Guidelines Panel. The types of BTCs  covered in these \nguidelines include: gallbladder cancer, and intrahepatic and extrahepatic \nCCA . By definition, the NCCN Guidelines cannot incorporate all possible \nclinical variations and are not intended to replace good clinical judgment or individualization of treatments. Although not explicitly stated at every \ndecision point of the guidelines, participation in prospective clinical trials is \nencouraged for the treatment of BTCs . \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines® for Biliary Tract  \nCancers, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature in  BTCs  published since the previous Guidelines \nupdate, using the search terms: biliary tract cancer OR gallbladder cancer \nOR cholangiocarcinoma.  The PubMed database was chosen because it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes \nonly peer -reviewed biomedical literature.  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; \nGuideline; Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta- Analysis; \nSystematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  The data from key PubMed \narticles and articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these \nGuidelines as discussed by the Panel have been included in this version of \nthe Discussion section. Recommendations for which high- level evidence is \nlacking are based on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert \nopinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances  the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation .2 NCCN Guidelines endeavor  to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased ; and \ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. \nNCCN Guidelines  incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing \non organ -specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men , women, female, and male  when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that \ndo not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and \ngender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or \ninconsistently. If sources do not diffe rentiate gender  from sex assigned at \nbirth or organs present, the information is presumed to predominantly \nrepresent cisgender individuals.

The \nvast majority of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinomas.3 Incidence \nsteadily increases with age, females are more likely to be diagnosed with gallbladder cancer than males, and incidence and mortality rates in the \nUnited States are highest among individuals of American Indian,  Alaska \nNative , and Asian/Pacific  Islander descent.\n4,5 However, from 1973 to 2015, \nthe incidence of gallbladder cancer has decreased in both males and \nfemales, white individuals, and individuals of American Indian/Alaskan \nNative and Asian/ Pacific Islander descent but there was a small trend for \nan increase in Black individuals.5 Globally, there are pockets of increased \nincidence in Korea; Japan; some areas of Eastern Europe and South \nAmerica, especially Bolivia, Chile, and Spain; and in females in India, \nPakistan, and Ecuador.6-8 Gallbladder cancer is characterized by local and \nvascular invasion, regional lymph node metastasis, and distant metastases.   \nRisk Factors \nCholelithiasis with the presence of chronic inflammation is the most \nprevalent risk factor for gallbladder cancer, and the risk increases with \nstone size.9,10 Calcification of the gallbladder wall (porcelain gallbladder), a \nresult of chronic inflammation of the gallbladder, has also been regarded as a risk factor for gallbladder cancer, with historical estimates of cancer in up \nto 22% of gallbladders with calcification.\n9 Subsequent reports, however, \nsuggest that the risk of developing gallbladder cancer in patients with \ngallbladder calcification is lower than anticipated, with gallbladder cancer \nbeing present in 7% to 15% of these patients.11-13 Other risk factors include \nanomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction, gallbladder polyps (>1 cm), \nchronic typhoid infection, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and inflammatory \nbowel disease.10,14 -16 Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder is also a potential, albeit somewhat controversial, risk factor. Prophylactic \ncholecystectomy is probably beneficial for patients who are at high risk of \ndeveloping gallbladder cancer (eg, porcelain gallbladder, polyps >1 cm).9 \nThe Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound has proposed 3  risk categories \nfor gallbladder polyps: extremely low risk, low risk, and indeterminate risk; \nand recommend a surgical consult for extremely low risk and low risk \npolyps ≥1.5 cm and for indeterminate risk polyps ≥0.7 cm.17 Patients with a \nhistory of chronic cholecystitis or pancreaticobiliary maljunction have a greater prevalence of gallbladder cancers that are microsatellite instability -\nhigh ( MSI-H).\n18  \nStaging and Prognosis  \nIn the AJCC staging system, gallbladder cancer is classified into four  \nstages based on the depth of invasion into the gallbladder wall and the \nextent of spread to surrounding organs and lymph nodes. In the revised 8th \nedition of the AJCC staging system, T2 gallbladder carcinoma was divided \ninto two groups: tumors on the peritoneal side (T2a) and tumors on the \nhepatic side (T2b).19 This revision is supported by two retrospective studies \nshowing that gallbladder tumors located on the hepatic side is associated \nwith worse prognosis, compared to tumors located on the peritoneal \nside.20,21 However, it is important to note that it can be difficult to determine \nthe location of the tumor, and gallbladder cancer can spread beyond the visible tumor, contributing to difficulty in predicting tumor location. Regional \nlymph node involvement is now s taged according to number of positive \nnodes, as opposed to staging based on anatomic location of involved \nlymph nodes.  \nTumor stage is the strongest prognostic factor for patients with gallbladder \ncancer.\n22,23 Results from a retrospective analysis of 435 patients treated at \na single center showed a median overall survival ( OS) of 10.3 months for \nthe entire cohort of patients.23 The median survival was 12.9 and 5.8 \nmonths for those presenting with stage IA –III and stage IV disease, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

It is important to note, however, that this retrospective \nanalysis did not control well for treatment -related variables.24 See the \nPrinciples of Pathology  in the algorithm for recommendations pertaining to \nprimary gallbladder cancer appropriate for resection.  \nDiagnosis  \nGallbladder cancer is commonly  diagnosed at an advanced stage because \nit is often asymptomatic in its early stages and has an aggressive nature \nthat can spread rapidly. Another factor contributing to late diagnosis of \ngallbladder cancer is a clinical presentation that mimics that of biliary colic \nor chronic cholecystitis. Hence, it is common for a diagnosis of gallbladder \ncancer to be an incidental finding at cholecystectomy for presumed benign \ngallbladder disease or, more frequently, on pathologic review f ollowing \ncholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis.  In a retrospective review of \n435 patients diagnosed and treated with curative resection at a single \ncenter from 1995 to 2005, 123 patients (47%) were diagnosed with \ngallbladder cancer as an incidental finding after cholecystectomy.23 Other \npossible clinical presentations of gallbladder cancer include a suspicious \nmass detected on ultrasound ( US) or biliary tract obstruction with jaundice \nor chronic right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The presence of jaundice \nin patients with gallbladder cancer is associated with a poor prognosis;  \npatients with jaundice are more likely to have advanced- stage disease \n(96% vs. 60%; P  < .001) and significantly lower disease- specific survival (6 \nvs.16 months; P < .0001) than those without jaundice.25 In a sample of 82 \npatients with gallbladder cancer who presented with jaundice, the \nresectability rate was low (7%), with even fewer having negative surgical \nmargins (5%)  and no disease- free survivors at 2 years .25 In another study, \n30% of patients with gallbladder cancer presenting with jaundice underwent \nresection with curative intent, compared to 75% of those without jaundice.26 \nJaundice also negatively impacted perioperative morbidity (69% vs. 38% in those without jaundice) and OS post -resection (median of 14 vs. 32 months \nin those without jaundice).  Workup  \nThe initial workup of patients presenting with a gallbladder mass or disease \nsuspicious for gallbladder cancer should include liver function tests  and an \nassessment of hepatic reserve. High- quality multiphasic contrast -enhanced \ncross- sectional imaging (CT and/or MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis \nis recommended to evaluate tumor penetration through the wall of the gallbladder and the presence of nodal and distant metastases, and to \ndetect the extent of direc t tumor invasion of other organs/biliary syste m or \nmajor vascular invasion.\n27 CT is more useful than US for the detection of \nlymph node involvement, adjacent organ invasion, and distant metastasis; \nMRI may be useful for distinguishing benign conditions from gallbladder \ncancer.3 However, both techniques were unreliable in the detection of \nlymph node metastases that were smaller than 10 mm.28 Although the role \nof PET scan has not been established in the evaluation of patients with gallbladder cancer, emerging evidence from retrospective studies indicates \nthat it may be useful for the detection of radiologically occult regional lymph \nnode and di stant metastatic disease in patients with otherwise potentially \nresectable disease.\n29-32 However, false positives related to an inflamed \ngallbladder are problematic.  \nFor patients presenting with jaundice, additional workup should include \ncholangiography to evaluate for hepatic and biliary invasion of tumor. \nNoninvasive magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRCP) is preferred \nover endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatog raphy (ERCP) or \npercutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), unless a therapeutic intervention is planned.\n27 \nCarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19 -9 testing could be considered \nas part of initial workup (in conjunction with imaging studies). Elevated \nserum CEA levels or CA 19- 9 levels could be suggestive of gallbladder \ncancer.33 While CA 19 -9 tends to have higher specificity (92.7% vs. 79.2% \nfor CEA), its sensitivity tends to be lower (50% vs. 79.4% for CEA).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBiliary Tract Cancers  \nMS-5 However, these markers are not specific for gallbladder cancer and CA \n19-9 could also be elevated in patients with other cancers or jaundice from \nother causes. Therefore, the P anel recommends carrying out these tests as \npart of a baseline assessment, and not for diagnostic purposes.  \nSurgical Management  \nThe surgical approach for the treatment  of all patients with resectable \ngallbladder cancer is the same, with the exception that in patients with an \nincidental finding of gallbladder cancer on pathologic review, the \ngallbladder has been removed. Complete resection with negative margins \nremains the only potentially curative treatment for patients with gallbladder \ncancer.34 The optimal resection consists of cholecystectomy with a limited \nhepatic resection (typically segments IVB and V) and portal \nlymphadenectomy to encompass the tumor with negative margins.35 \nLymphadenectomy should include lymph nodes in the porta hepatis, \ngastrohepatic ligament, and retroduodenal regions without routine resection \nof the bile duct. Extended hepatic resections (beyond segments IV B and \nV) and resection of the bile duct may be necessary in some patients to \nobtain negative margins, depending on the stage and location of the tumor, depth of tumor invasion, proximity to adjacent organs, and expertise of the \nsurgeon.  \nA simple cholecystectomy is an adequate treatment for patients with T1a \ntumors, with the long -term survival rate approaching 100%.\n36 \nCholecystectomy combined with hepatic resection and lymphadenectomy \nis associated with an improved survival for patients with T2 or higher \ntumors. There is some controversy regarding the benefit of radical \nresection over simple cholecystectomy for patients with T1b tumors, and \nthere is some risk of finding residual nodal or hepatic disease when re -\nresecting these patients.37-42 Some studies have demonstrated an \nassociated improvement in cancer -specific survival for patients with T1b \nand T2 tumors and no improvement in survival for patients with T3 tumors.38-40 Other reports suggest that survival benefit associated with \nextended resection and lymphadenectomy is seen only in patients with T2 \ntumors and some T3 tumors with localized hepatic invasion and limited \nregional node involvement.41,42 One meta -analysis noted that regional \nlymphadenectomy was associated with prolonged  survival in  patients with \nT1b, T2, and T3 tumors.43 Vega et al44 reported a recurrence- free survival \n(RFS) rate of 47% at 5 years in patients with gallbladder cancer that was \nT1b or greater following oncologic extended resection. T3 and T4 disease \nwere identified as independent risk factors for recurrence at 24 months post extended resection.  \nEmpiric major hepatic resection and bile duct resection have been shown \nto increase morbidity without any demonstrable difference in survival.\n35,45 \nBile duct resection was also not associated with a higher lymph node yield \nor improvements in survival .46 A retrospective analysis of prospective data \ncollected on 104 patients undergoing surgery for gallbladder cancer from \n1990 to 2002 showed that in a multivariate analysis, higher T and N stage, \npoor differentiation, and common bile duct involvement were independent \npredict ors of poor disease- specific survival.45 Major hepatectomy and \ncommon bile duct excision significantly increased overall perioperative morbidity (53%) and were not independently associated with long -term \nsurvival. Fuks et al from the AFS -GBC -2009 study group also reported that \nbile duct resection resulted in a postoperative morbidity rate of 60% in \npatients with  an incidental finding of gallbladder cancer.\n35 However, for \nthese patients , it has been suggested that common duct resection should \nbe performed at the time of re -resection for those with positive cystic duct \nmargins due to the presence of residual disease.47 However, occasionally \nthe cystic duct stump can be re- resected to a negative margin.  \nWith these data in mind, the guidelines recommend that extended hepatic resections (beyond segments IV B and V ) should be performed only when \nnecessary to obtain negative margins (R0 resection) in well -selected PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBiliary Tract Cancers  \nMS-6 clinical situations as discussed above.38,40 -42 Bile duct excision should only \nbe performed in the presence of adherent nodal disease and/or locally \ninvasive disease or to obtain a negative cystic duct margin if necessary.45 \nAmong patients with an incidental finding of gallbladder cancer, there is \nsome evidence that a delayed resection due to referral to a tertiary cancer \ncenter or a radical resection following an initial noncurative procedure is not \nassociated with a survival  deficit compared with immediate resection.48,49 \nHowever, these comparisons are difficult to interpret due to selection bias. \nNevertheless, in all patients with convincing clinical evidence of gallbladder \ncancer, the guidelines recommend that surgery should be performed by an \nexperienced surgeon who is prepared to do a definitive resection of the tumor. If malignancy is suspected or confirmed after cholecystectomy has \nbeen initiated and expertise is available, then definitive resection should be \nundertaken. If expertise is unavailable, patients should be referred to a \ncenter with available expertise. If the diagnosis is not clear, frozen section \nbiopsies can be considered in selected cases before proceeding with \ndefinitive resection. The Panel is also of the opinion that surgery should not \nbe performed in situations where the extent and resectability of the disease \nhas not been established  with good quality imaging. If malignancy is \nsuspected before cholecystectomy has begun and there is a question of resectability (ie, locally advanced disease, possible m etastatic disease, \nother), then definitive resection can be postponed regardless of available expertise, until complete staging and evaluation has been performed. All \nfindings should be documented , and biopsy considered if chemotherapy is \nanticipated. Consultation with a pathologist with expertise in the \nhepatobiliary region should be considered, and careful review of the \npathology report for T stage, cystic duct margin status, and other margins \nfollowing surgery is crucial. If an imaging study shows a susp icious \ngallbladder mass, then the patient should be referred to an experienced \ncenter where they may be considered for upfront definitive resection.  Management of Resectable Disease  \nAll patients should undergo cross -sectional imaging (CT and/or MRI) of the \nchest, abdomen, and pelvis prior to surgery to evaluate local extent of \ndisease and the presence of distant metastases. Staging laparoscopy has \nbeen shown to identify radiographically occult disseminated disease in \npatients with primary gallbladder cancer.\n50 In a prospective study that \nevaluated the role of staging laparoscopy in 409 patients diagnosed with primary gallbladder cancer, Agarwal et al reported a significantly higher \nyield in locally advanced tumors compared with early -stage tumors (25.2% \nvs. 10. 7%; P = .02); the accuracy for detecting unresectable disease and a \ndetectable lesion in locally advanced tumors (56.0% and 94.1%, \nrespectively) was similar to that in early -stage tumors (54.6% and 100%, \nrespectively).\n50 In this study, the use of staging laparoscopy obviated the \nneed for laparotomy in 55.9% of patients with unresectable disease. \nStaging laparoscopy, however, is of relatively low yield in patients with \nincidental finding of gallbladder cancer, since dissem inated disease is \nrelatively uncommon, and the patients have already had an assessment of \ntheir peritoneal cavity at the time of cholecystectomy.51 Higher yields may \nbe obtained in patients who are at higher risk for disseminated metastases \n(those with poorly differentiated, T3 or higher tumors or margin- positive \ntumors at cholecystectomy).51 \nIn patients with a suspicious gallbladder mass  discovered during surgery , a \ndefinitive resection with cholecystectomy and en bloc hepatic resection and \nlymphadenectomy is recommended  when hepatobiliary surgery expertise is \navailable. In cases where a suspicious gallbladder mass is discovered \nduring surgery , but hepatobiliary surgery expertise is unavailable or \nresectability is unclear, the abdomen should be visually inspected,  and all \nfindings should be documented. Intraoperative staging, with or without \nbiopsy, is recommended. The surgery should be ended and the patient \nshould be referred to a specialist. Additional postoperative workup is \nrecommended.

Additionally, some \ntumors are unresectable based on local i nvasion of the porta hepatis and \nits vascular and biliary structures.  \nAmong patients with an incidental finding of gallbladder cancer on \npathologic review, those with T1a lesions may be observed if the tumor \nmargins are negative since these tumors have not penetrated the muscle \nlayer and long -term survival approaches 100% wi th simple \ncholecystectomy.36 In a sample of 122 patients with gallbladder cancer \ndiagnosed incidentally, identified in a prospectively maintained database, \nliver involvement at re -resection (after cholecystectomy) was associated \nwith decreased RFS and disease- specific survival for pat ients with T2 \ntumors (median RFS was 12 months vs. not reached for patients without \nliver involvement, P  = .004; median was 25 months vs. not reached for \npatients without liver involvement, P  = .003) but not in patients with T1b \ntumors.24  \nAs mentioned above, hepatic resection and lymphadenectomy with or \nwithout bile duct excision  (for malignant involvement)  is recommended for \npatients with T1b or greater  lesions  and/or with T1a lesions with positive \nmargins .38,40,41 Re-resection to achieve negative margins is recommended \nfor these patients with incidental gallbladder cancer since a significant percentage of these patients have been found to harbor residual disease \nwithin the liver and common bile duct.\n23,47 Furthermore, although \nrandomized trials are lacking, re -resection is generally associated with \nimproved OS compared to cholecystectomy alone. Port site disease is \nassociated with disseminated peritoneal metastases, and prophylactic port \nsite resection is not associated with improved survival or disease \nrecurrence in patients with incidental findings of gallbladder cancer and, \nthus, should not be considered during definitive resection.52,53 For patients with a suspicious mass detected on imaging, the guidelines \nrecommend cholecystectomy plus en bloc hepatic resection, and \nlymphadenectomy, with or without bile duct excision (for malignant \ninvolvement) . A biopsy is not necessary in most cases and a diagnostic \nlaparoscopy is recommended prior to definitive resection.50 Jaundice in \npatients with gallbladder cancer is considered a relative contraindication to \nsurgery, and outcomes are generally poor in these patients; only a rare \ngroup of patients with localized node- negative disease potentially benefit \nfrom complete resec tion.25,54- 56 In patients with jaundice, if gallbladder \ncancer is suspected, surgery should only be performed if a complete resection is feasible. These patients should be carefully evaluated prior to \nsurgery and referral to an experienced center should be considered. The \nguidelines recommend consideration of preoperative biliary drainage for \npatients with jaundice. However, caution should be exercised in patients \nwith biliary obstruction as drainage is not always feasible and can be \ndangerous. Decisions regarding biliary drainage should be made by an \nexperienced multidisciplinary team.  \nAlthough there are limited clinical trial data to define a standard regimen or \ndefinitive benefit , the P anel recommends consideration of a course of \nneoadjuvant systemic therapy for patients with jaundice. Gallbladder \ncancer that is locally advanced or has lymph node involvement is \nassociated with a poor prognosis, but neoadjuvant systemic therapy may \nallow the oncologist to evaluate the biology of the tumor and identify \npatients who are most likely to benefit from surgical intervention. A \nsystematic review  of eight  studies found that approximately  one third of the \n474 patients achieved an  R0 resection with the use of neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.\n57 In a retrospective analysis of 74 \npatients with locally advanced or lymph node- positive disease who \nreceived systemic therapy, 30% of patients underwent resection.58 Out of \nthe 22 patients who underwent resection, 45% underwent definitive resection, with OS being significantly greater for patients who underwent PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

Another study reported a response rate of 52.5% \nand a clinical benefit rate of 70% in 160 patients with gallbladder cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 41.2% of patients underwent \nresection with curative intent.\n59 These patients had an associated \nprolonged OS (49 vs. 7 months; P  = .0001) and event -free survival (25 vs. \n5 months; P  = .0001) compared to those who did not undergo resection. A \nphase III randomized study is underway to compare neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with locally \nadvanced gallbladder cancer (NCT02867865).\n60 \nIn patients for whom there is evidence of locoregionally advanced disease \n(ie, nodal disease or evidence of other high -risk disease), neoadjuvant \nsystemic therapy should be considered  to rule out rapid progression and \navoid futile surgery . The decision to use neoadjuvant therapy needs to be \nindividualized and in close consultation with a surgical oncologist and a multidisciplinary team. A period of 2 to 6 months with reassessment every 2 \nto 3 months is reasonable. Neoadjuvant treatment options are included as \nother recommended regimens and are the same as those recommended \nfor the primary treatment for unresectable and metastatic disease (see the \nPrinciples of Systemic Therapy ). The Panel currently does not recommend \nneoadjuvant chemoradiation for these patients, although a prospective \nstudy including 28 patients with locally advanced gallbladder cancer \nshowed that an R0 resection was achieved in 14 patients, with good local \ncontrol (93%) and 5 -year survival (47%), following treatment with \ngemcitabine with concurrent  radiation therapy ( RT).\n61 \nA combination of chemotherapy (gemcitabine- based or \nfluoroypyrimidine- based) and chemoradiation may be options for adjuvant \ntreatment. See the section on Adjuvant Chemotherapy and  Chemoradiation \nfor Biliary Tract Cancers . Management of Unresectable or Metastatic Disease  \nPreoperative evaluation and a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis is recommended for patients with unresectable (includes tumors with distant \nlymph node metastases in the celiac axis or aortocaval groove) or \nmetastatic disease (includes distant metastases, nodal metastases beyond \nthe porta hepatis, and extensive involvement of the porta hepatis causing \njaundice or vascular encasement). Molecular testing is recommended. \nPrimary options for these patients include: 1) systemic therapy  (preferred); \n2) clinical tria l (preferred) ; or 3) best supportive care. In addition, palliative \nRT is included as an option for patients with unresectable disease. See \nsections on Chemotherapy and Chemoradiation and Radiation Therapy for \nTreatment for Advanced Biliary Tract Cancers . Following primary \ntreatment, except for those receiving best supportive care, the disease \nshould be assessed for response. Resection or locoregional therapy should \nbe reconsidered. Subsequent -line systemic therapy is an option if there is \nprogression on o r after systemic therapy.  \nIn patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer and jaundice, \nbiliary drainage is an appropriate palliative procedure and should be \nconsidered before instituting resection and systemic therapy  if technically \nfeasible.\n54 However, caution should be exercised in patients with biliary \nobstruction as drainage is not always feasible and can be dangerous  due to \nextensive segmental biliary isolation. Decisions regarding biliary drainage \nshould be made by a multidisciplinary team  and carefully planned. Biliary \ndrainage followed by chemotherapy can result in improved quality of life. \nCA 19 -9 testing can be considered after biliary decompression.  \nSurveillance  \nThere are no data to support a specific surveillance schedule or tests \nfollowing resection of gallbladder cancer; determination of appropriate \nfollow- up schedule/imaging should include a careful patient/physician \ndiscussion.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBiliary Tract Cancers  \nMS-9 for gallbladder cancer should include consideration of imaging studies \nevery 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6 to 12 months for up to 5 \nyears , or as clinically indicated. Assessment of CEA and CA 19- 9 may also \nbe considered as clinically indicated. Re- evaluation according to the initial \nworkup should be considered in the event of disease relapse or \nprogression.  In a study of 217 patients who underwent surgery with \ncurative intent, 35.0% had a recurrence at the last follow -up, with a median \ntime to rec urrence of 9.5 months.62 The authors note that recurrence \noccurred within a 2 -year time -frame post -surgery in most patients .  \nCholangiocarcinomas \nCholangiocarcinomas encompass tumors originating in the epithelium of the biliary tree. More than 90% of CCAs are adenocarcinomas and are \nbroadly divided into three histologic types based on their growth patterns: \nmass -forming, periductal -infiltrating, and  intraductal -growing.\n63 CCAs are \ndiagnosed throughout the biliary tree and are typically classified as either \nintrahepatic or extrahepatic CCA. Extrahepatic CCAs are more common \nthan intrahepatic CCAs.64 Analyses of SEER data from 2001 to 2017 \nshowed that incidence of intrahepatic CCA increased dramatically \n(148.8%), while incidence of extrahepatic CCA increased at a slower rate \n(7.5%).65 The increase in incidence of intrahepatic CCA may have been \ndue to an improvement in the ability to accurately diagnose intrahepatic CCA, such as with imaging, molecular diagnostics, and pathology.\n66 These \ncancers might have previously been diagnosed as cancers of unknown primary, for which incidence decreased from 1973 to 2012 (annual \npercentage change, -1.87%).\n66 Five-year OS rates for CCA improved from \n1973 to 2008, likely due to improvements in treatment for this disease.67 \nIntrahepatic CCAs are located within the hepatic parenchyma and have \nalso been called “peripheral CCAs”  (Figure 1 ). Extrahepatic CCAs occur \nanywhere within the extrahepatic bile duct —from the junction of the right \nand left hepatic ducts to the common bile duct, including the intrapancreatic portion (Figure 1 )—and are further classified into hilar or distal tumors . Hilar \nor perihilar CCAs (also called Klatskin tumors) occur at or near the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts including the common hepatic duct; distal \nCCAs are extrahepatic lesions arising in the extrahepatic bile ducts above \nthe ampulla of Vater and below the junction of the common hepatic duct \nand cystic duct.\n64 Perihilar CCAs are the most common type of extrahepatic \nCCAs.  \nThe NCCN Guidelines discuss the clinical management of intrahepatic and \nextrahepatic CCAs including hilar and distal subtypes. Tumors of the \nampulla of Vater are not included in the NCCN Guidelines for Biliary Tract \nCancers.  \nRisk Factors  \nNo predisposing factors are identified in most patients diagnosed with CCA ,\n68 although there is evidence that particular risk factors may be \nassociated with the disease in some patients. These risk factors, like those \nfor gallbladder cancer, are associated with the presence of chronic \ninflammation. Primary sclerosing cholangitis, c hronic calculi of the bile duct \n(hepatolithiasis),  choledochal cysts, and liver fluke infections are \nwell-established risk factors for CCA . Unlike gallbladder cancer, however, \ncholelithiasis is not thought to be linked with CCA .69 Inflammatory bowel \ndisease may also be a risk factor for CCA , although this association may \nbe confounded by primary sclerosing cholangitis.70 Other risk factors \nspecific to  intrahepatic CCA , which tends to be similar to hepatocellular \ncarcinoma ( HCC) , have been found to include hepatitis B virus ( HBV) \ninfection, cirrhosis, diabetes, obesity, alcohol, and tobacco.71 A systematic \nreview and meta -analysis reported that the strongest risk factors for both \nintrahepatic and extrahepatic CCA  included biliary cysts and stones, \ncirrhosis, HBV, and hepatitis C virus .72 This may be responsible for the \nincreased incidence of intrahepatic CCA  observed at some centers, \nalthough future studies are needed to further explore this putative PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBiliary Tract Cancers  \nMS-10 association.73 A systematic review including seven case- control studies \n(9102 patients and 129,111 controls) showed that metabolic dysfunction-\nassociated steatotic liver disease is associated with increased incidence of \nboth intrahepatic (pooled adjusted OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.49 –2.91) and \nextrahepatic CCA  (pooled adjusted OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.59– 2.64).74  \nStaging and Prognosis  \nIntrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma  \nIn the 6th edition of the AJCC staging system, intrahepatic CCA  was \nstaged identically to HCC. However, this staging system did not include \npredictive clinicopathologic features (multiple hepatic tumors, regional \nnodal involvement, and large tumor size) that are specific to intrahepatic \nCCA .75 In some reports, tumor size had no effect on survival in patients \nundergoing complete resection.76,77 In a SEER database analysis of 598 \npatients with intrahepatic CCA  who had undergone surgery, Nathan et al \nreported that multiple lesions and vascular invasion predicted adverse prognosis following resection; lymph node status was of prognostic \nsignificance among patients without distant metastases.\n76 In this study, \ntumor size had no independent effect on survival. These findings were confirmed in a subsequent multi -institutional international study of 449 \npatients undergoing surgery for intrahepatic CCA .\n77 The 5 -year survival \nrate was higher for patients who lacked all three risk factors (multiple \ntumors, vascular invasion, and N1 disease) than for those with ≥1 risk \nfactors (38.3%, 27.3%, and 18.1%, respectively) and, more importantly, \ntumor number and vascular invasion were of prognostic significance only \nin patients with N0 disease. Although tumor size was associated with \nsurvival in the  univariate analysis, it was not of prognostic significance in a \nmultivariate analysis.  \nIn the revised 7th edition of the AJCC staging system, intrahepatic CCA  had \na new staging classification that was independent of the staging \nclassification used for HCC.78 This classification focused on multiple tumors, vascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis. Farges et al from \nthe AFC -IHCC study group validated this staging classification in 163 \npatients with resectable intrahepatic CCA .79 The revised classification was \nuseful in predicting survival according to the TNM staging. With a median \nfollow- up of 34 months, the median survival was not reached for patients \nwith stage I disease, was 53 months for those with stage II disease ( P = \n.01), and was 16 months for those with stage III disease ( P < .0001).  \nIn the revised 8th edition of the AJCC staging system, T1 disease (ie, \nsolitary tumor without vascular invasion) should now be staged according \nto tumor size (ie, T1a refers to a tumor that is ≤5 cm, while T1b refers to a \ntumor that is >5 cm).19 T2 disease, on the other hand, is no longer divided \ninto T2a (solitary tumor with vascular invasion) and T2b (multiple tumors with or without vascular invasion) disease.  See the P rinciples of Pathology  \nin the algorithm for recommendations pertaining to intrahepatic CCA appropriate for biopsy and for patients undergoing resection.  \nExtrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma  \nThe 7th edition of the AJCC staging system included a separate TNM \nclassification for hilar and distal extrahepatic CCA , based on the extent of \nliver involvement and distant metastatic disease.78 In the revised 8th edition \nof the AJCC staging system, regional lymph node involvement is now \nstaged according to number of positive nodes.19 Depth of tumor invasion is \nan independent predictor of outcome in patients with distal as well as hilar CCAs .\n80,81 In the revised 8th edition of the AJCC staging system for cancer \nof the distal bile duct, depth of tumor invasion has been added to the categorization of T1, T2, and T3 tumors.\n19 \nThe modified Bismuth -Corlette staging system82 and the Blumgart staging \nsystem83 are used for the classification of hilar CCAs . The modified \nBismuth -Corlette staging system classifies hilar CCAs  into four  types based \non the extent of biliary involvement.

In addition, both the \nAJCC and the Bismuth- Corlette staging systems are not useful for \npredicting resectability or survival. The Blumgart staging system  is a useful \npreoperative staging system that predicts resectability, likelihood of \nmetastatic disease, and survival.83,84 In this staging system, hilar CCAs  are \nclassified into three  stages (T1– T3) based on the location and extent of bile \nduct involvement, the presence or absence of portal venous invasion, and \nhepatic lobar atrophy.83 Negative histologic margins, concomitant partial \nhepatectomy, and well -differentiated tumor histology were associated with \nimproved outcome after resection; increasing T  stage significantly \ncorrelated with reduced R0 resection rate, distant metastatic disease, and \nlower median survival.84 See the P rinciples of Pathology  in the algorithm for \nrecommendations pertaining to extrahepatic CCA appropriate for biopsy and for patients undergoing resection.  \nDiagnosis  \nEarly -stage CCA  may only manifest as mild changes in serum liver function \ntests  (particularly alkaline phosphatase) . Patients with intrahepatic CCA , \ndue to their often late presentation, are more likely to present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and/or abdominal pain; \nsymptoms of biliary obstruction are uncommon because these tumors do \nnot necessarily involve the common hepatic/ bile duct. Intrahepatic CCA  \nmay be detected incidentally as an isolated intrahepatic mass on imaging.\n85 \nIn contrast, patients with extrahepatic CCA  are likely to present with \njaundice followed by evidence of a biliary obstruction or abnormality on subsequent imaging.  \nWorkup  \nThe initial workup should include liver function tests. CEA and CA 19- 9 \ntesting can be considered for baseline assessment, although these \nmarkers are not specific for CCA ; they are also associated with other \nmalignancies and benign conditions.\n86 CA 19 -9 may be falsely elevated due to jaundice.87 Viral hepatitis serologies should be considered for \nintrahepatic CCA . If viral hepatitis is diagnosed, it needs to be monitored \nand managed following ASCO’s guidelines.88 Since the diagnosis of HCC \nversus intrahepatic CCA  can be difficult, alpha- fetoprotein ( AFP)  testing \nmay also be considered, especially in patients with chronic liver disease. \nFurther, there are a number of mixed HCC/intrahepatic CCA cases in which \nAFP may be elevated. Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System provides \nsome guidance in distinguishing between HCC and intrahepatic CCA  \nlesions.89 \nEarly surgical consultation (prior to drainage in patients with jaundice)  with \na multidisciplinary team is recommended as part of the initial workup for \nassessment of resectability in intrahepatic and extrahepatic CCAs . The \nPanel emphasizes that a multidisciplinary review of imaging studies \ninvolving experienced radiologists and surgeons is necessary to stage the \ndisease and determine potential treatment options (ie, resection or other \napproach). Providers should only proceed with biopsy once transplant (for \npatients with extrahepatic CCA) or resectability status has been \ndetermined. For patients with hilar CCA  who may be candidates for \ntransplant, transperitoneal biopsy is contraindicated and will likely preclude \ntransplantation based on current protocols .90 For patients undergoing \nresection, biopsy is usually not necessary. However, it should be noted that \napproximately 5%  to 10% of these cases will turn out to be benign .91  \nTissue diagnosis from the most accessible site is necessary to document the disease, obtain genomics information, and start treatment. Multiphasic \nabdomen and pelvis CT/MRI IV contrast to assess the involvement of the \nliver, major vessels, nearby lymph nodes, and distant sites is also \nrecommended when extrahepatic CCA  is suspected.\n92,93 There are no \npathognomonic CT/MRI features associated with intrahepatic CCA , but \nCT/MRI can indicate the involvement of major vessels and the presence of \nvascular anomalies and satellite lesions.92,94,95 Therefore, multiphasic PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBiliary Tract Cancers  \nMS-12 CT/MRI with IV contrast is used to help determine tumor resectability by \ncharacterizing the primary tumor, its relationship to nearby major vessels \nand the biliary tree, the presence of satellite lesions and distant metastases \nin the liver, and lymph node involvement.85,92 Multiphasic abdomen/pelvis \nCT/MRI with IV contrast is preferred for intrahepatic CCA; however, \ncontrast -enhanced US is also an option. In addition, chest CT (with or \nwithout contrast) should be performed, and staging laparoscopy may be considered in conjunction with surgery if no distant metastasis is found. \nThe American College of Radiology has published recommendations for \nliver MRI.\n96 Imaging evaluation for suspected extrahepatic CCA is ideally \nperformed prior to biliary decompression to facilitate accurate local staging for surgical candidacy.  \nEndoscopic US may be useful for distal common bile duct cancers for defining a mass or abnormal thickening, which can direct biopsies. For hilar \nCCA , endoscopic US should only be done after surgical consultation to \nprevent jeopardizing a patient’s candidacy for transplantation. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy  and colonoscopy are recommended as part \nof initial workup for patients with intrahepatic CCA  since a mass diagnosed \nas adenocarcinoma can be metastatic disease. Pathologic workup can be \nsuggestive of CCA  but is not definitive. IgG4 -associated cholangitis, which \npresents with biliary strictures and obstructive jaundice, may mimic extrahepatic CCA .\n97,98 Therefore, serum IgG4 should be considered to rule \nout autoimmune cholangitis in patients for whom a diagnosis of extrahepatic CCA  is not clear, in order to avoid an unnecessary surgical \nresection.\n99,100 Patients with IgG4 -related cholangiopathy should be \nreferred to an expert center.  \nContrast -enhanced MRCP and/or CT as a diagnostic modality is \nrecommended over direct cholangiography for the diagnosis of bile duct \ncancers.101,102 MRCP has been shown to have a higher sensitivity, \nspecificity, and diagnostic accuracy compared to ERCP in the diagnosis and pre -treatment staging of hilar CCAs .103 Data also support the use of \nMRCP and CT as the preferred method of cholangiography for the \nassessment of bile duct tumors.104 Direct cholangiography should only be \nperformed when necessary as a diagnostic procedure in patients with \nunresectable disease or in patients in whom a therapeutic intervention is \nnecessary. ERCP/PTC is not recommended for the diagnosis of extrahepatic CCA , since this is associated with complications and \ncontamination of the biliary tree. For distal bile duct tumors in which a \ndiagnosis is needed or where palliation is indicated, an ERCP allows for \ncomplete imaging of the bile duct and stenting of the obst ruction. In \naddition, brush cytology of the bile duct can be obtained for pathologic \nevaluation. Since many of the patients with extrahepatic CCA  present with \njaundice, workup should include noninvasive cholangiography with \ncross- sectional imaging to evaluate local tumor extent.\n92 Although the role \nof PET imaging has not been established in the evaluation of patients with \nCCA , emerging evidence indicates that it may be useful for the detection of \nregional lymph node metastases and distant metastatic disease in patients with otherwise potentially resectable disease.\n29-31,105,106 \nManagement of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma  \nPatients with intrahepatic CCA should be evaluated for potentially curative therapies (resection; and for small lesions, ablation). However, most \npatients are not candidates for surgery due to the presence of advanced \ndisease at diagnosis. The optimal surgical margin associated with improved \nsurvival and reduced risk of recurrence in patients undergoing surgery \nremains uncertain, with some reports documenting R0 resection as a \nsignificant predictor of survival and recurrence,\n107- 112 while others suggest \nthat margin status is not a significant predictor of outcome.113,114 Ribero et \nal from the Italian Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Study Group reported \nthat margin- negative resection was associated with significantly higher \nsurvival rates (the estimated 5 -year survival rates were 39.8% vs. 4.7% for \npatients with a positive margin) and significantly lower recurrence rates PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

In highly selected situations, resection can be \nconsidered. A preoperative biopsy is not always necessary prior to \ndefinitive and potentially curative resection. Although limited multifocal liver tumors (including satellite lesions) and gross lymph node metastases to the \nporta hepatis are considered relative contraindications to  surgery, surgical approaches can be considered in selected patients. Minimally invasive \napproaches by experienced surgeons have been proven to be safe and \neffective  for well- selected cases .\n117,118 Patient selection for surgery is \nfacilitated by careful preoperative staging, which may include laparoscopy to identify patients with unresectable or disseminated metastatic \ndisease.\n119,120 Staging laparoscopy has been shown to identify peritoneal \nmetastases and liver metastases with a respective yield of 36% and 67% \naccuracy in patients with potentially resectable intrahepatic CCA  and \nshould be considered .119 A portal lymphadenectomy helps provide accurate \nstaging information.121 Lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic \nindicator of survival.77,112 Therefore, resection and regional \nlymphadenectomy of the porta hepatis are  recommended. It is important to \nnote, however, that there are no data to support a therapeutic benefit of routine lymph node dissection in patients undergoing surgery.\n122- 125 \nAblation may be considered in the rare patient s with small single tumors <3 \ncm.  \nOne study determined that neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with \nhigher OS (HR, 0.16; P  = .01) but did not impact RFS (HR, 0.54; P  = .27) in \npatients undergoing hepatic resection.126 Another study found no difference \nin survival both in an unadjusted analysis ( P = .51) and in a propensity \nscore- matched analysis (HR, 0.78; P  = .16).127 However, the data suggest \nthat patients with stage II –III intrahepatic CCA may have a survival benefit \nfrom neoadjuvant therapy (unadjusted analysis , P = .10; propensity -score \nmatched analysis HR, .58; P  = .02) . The optimal adjuvant treatment \nstrategy for patients with resected intrahepatic CCA  has not been \ndetermined and there are limited clinical trial data to support a standard \nregimen for adjuvant treatment. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion, \nlymph node metastasis, and tumor size ≥5 cm have been reported as \nindependent predictors of recurrence and reduced OS following \nresection.128,129 Since recurrence following resection is common, these \ntumor -specific risk factors could be considered as criteria for selection of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

See Adjuvant \nChemotherapy and Chemoradiation for Biliary Tract Cancers  in this \nDiscussion .  \nThere are clinical trials investigating whether liver transplantation would be \nbeneficial for patients with intrahepatic CCA  (NCT04195503) . Very highly \nselected candidates may meet the criteria for referral. However, these trials are only available at a small subset of centers.  The results of a \nretrospective study showed that patients with very early intrahepatic CCA, \ndefined as single tumors ≤2 cm, had a 5 -year cumulative risk of recurrence \nof 18%, compared to 61% in patients with advanced intrahepatic CCA, defined as a single tumor >2 cm or with the presence of multifocal \ndisease.\n130 The 5- year actuarial survival rates w ere 65% in the former \ngroup compared to 45% in the advanced intrahepatic CCA cohort.  In \nanother study, researchers found that patients with intrahepatic CCA who \nunderwent liver transplantation had an improved prognosis compared to \nthose who underwent resection in unmatched (HR, 0.65; P = .002)  and \nmatched (HR, 0.62; P = .009)  cohorts.131 In a prospective case -series, out \nof 6 patients who underwent transplantation for intrahepatic CCA,  50% had \nRFS at 5 years.132 OS was 83.3% at 5 years.    \nPrimary treatment options for patients with unresectable or metastatic disease include: systemic therapy ; clinical trial; or consideration of \nlocoregional therapy (arterially directed therapies  or RT ); or best supportive \ncare. In addition, the combination of chemotherapy and chemoradiation, \nchemoradiation alone, and consideration of referral to a transplant center  \nare included as options for patients with unresectable disease. Systemic \ntherapy or enrollment in a clinical trial are preferred options for patients with \nmetastatic intrahepatic CCA. See sections on Chemotherapy and \nChemoradiation and Radiation Therapy for Treatment for Advanced Biliary \nTract Cancers in this Discussion . Following primary treatment, except for \nthose receiving best supportive care, the disease should be assessed for response. Resection or locoregional therapy should be reconsidered. Subsequent -line systemic therapy is an option if there is progression on or \nafter systemic therapy. Evaluation for liver transplantation should also be \nconsidered as patients who meet the following criteria will be eligible for \ntransplant exception points: biopsy -proven intrahepatic CCA or mixed \nHCC- intrahepatic CCA, presence of cirrhosis, unresectable, received \nlocoregional or systemic therapy, and 6 months from time of diagnosis or \nlast treatment with no new lesions or extrahepatic disease.\n133 \nLocoregional Therapy  \nLocoregional therapy may be considered in patients who are not \ncandidates for surgical curative therapies or to downstage for other \ntreatments.134 Locoregional therapies such as radiofrequency ablation,135,136 \ntransarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ),137- 139 TACE with drug -eluting \nbeads ( DEB-TACE ), or TACE drug -eluting microspheres ,138,140,141 and \nradioembolization ( TARE ) with Y90 microspheres139,142 -147 have been \nshown to be safe and effective in a small retrospective series of patients \nwith unresectable intrahepatic CCAs . For recurrent or primary small single \ntumors <3  cm, thermal ablation is a reasonable alternative to surgical \nresection, particularly in patients with high- risk disease.148- 150 Ablation \noptions include radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and irreversible electroporation. Hepatic tumors may be amenable to arterially \ndirected therapies provided the supply to the tumor may be isolated without \nexcessive non -target treatment. Arterially directed therapies may be \nconsidered for select patients with limited extrahepatic disease (hilar lymph \nnode ≤3 cm  or ≤ 5 lung nodules ≤ 1 cm each). These therapies may be \nused alone or followed by systemic chemotherapy with the intention to prolong survival or downstage to curative resection.\n151,152 \nThe results of two independent prospective studies showed that the \nefficacy of TACE with irinotecan DEB was similar to that of gemcitabine \nand oxaliplatin (GEMOX), but was superior to that of TACE with mitomycin PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

Another systematic review and meta -analysis of 21 studies with \n921 patients reported an overall disease control rate of 82.3% in patients \nwith unresectable intrahepatic CCA treated with radioembolization with \nY90.154 The median OS and PFS were 12.7 months and 7.8 months, \nrespectively. Other smaller series have also reported favorable response \nrates and survival benefit for patients with unresectable intrahepatic CCA  \ntreated with TARE with Y90  microspheres.142,145,147 Due to the rarity of this \ndisease, none of these locoregional approaches has been evaluated in \nrandomized controlled trials ( RCTs ). Personalized dosimetry/radiation \nsegmentectomy to achieve delivery of >205 Gy to the tumor may improve outcomes in patient s treated with Y90.\n155 Y90 is relatively contraindicated in \npatients with bilirubin >3 mg/dL.  In well- selected patients, grade 3– 4 \nhepatic toxicity occurs in <10% of patients, although this may be \nsignificantly higher in patients with cirrhosis.156 In the phase II MISPHEC \ntrial, investigators determined that the combination of radioembolization \nwith Y90 microspheres with chemotherapy (cisplatin and gemcitabine) as a \nfirst-line treatment option in 41 patients with unresectable intrahepatic CCA  \nresulted in a 39% response rate, by RECIST criteria.151 The median PFS \nand OS were 14 months and 22 months, respectively. Additionally, 22% of patients were downstaged to surgery.  \nConsideration of RT is a locoregional treatment option for unresectable \nintrahepatic CCA .\n157 A single -institution study including 79 patients with \nunresectable intrahepatic CCA showed that higher doses of RT (3D  \nconformal RT [3D-CRT] with photons or protons) w ere associated with \nbetter 3 -year OS (73% vs. 38%, respectively; P = .017) and 3- year local control (78% vs. 45%, respectively; P = .04), compared with lower doses of \nRT.158 A study using data from the National Cancer database determined \nthat patients treated with ablative RT had improved survival outcomes (23.7 \nvs. 12.8 months; P < .001) compared to those treated with conventional RT \n(23.7 vs. 12.8 months) .159 Stereotactic body RT  (SBRT ) may also be used \nfor patients with unresectable intrahepatic CCA .160 A non- randomized multi -\ninstitutional trial including 39 patients with unresectable intrahepatic CCA  \nshowed that hypofractionated proton therapy resulted in a 2- year OS rate \nof 46.5% (median OS , 22.5 months) and a 2- year PFS rate of 25.7%.161 \nAnother multi -institutional trial reported a local control rate of 90.9% and an \nOS rate of 81.8% at 1 year for patients with intrahepatic CCA treated with \nhypofractionated proton beam therapy .162  \nRT dosing depends on the ability to meet normal organ constraints and \nunderlying liver function.163 All tumors irrespective of the tumor location \nmay be amenable to RT using 3D -CRT and intensity -modulated RT .164,165 \nThe Panel strongly recommends image -guided RT when using RT, \nintensity -modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ), and SBRT to improve \ntreatment accuracy and reduce treatment -related toxicity. Dosing \nschedules may depend on margin positivity and may include up to 45 Gy at \n1.8 Gy/fraction or 50 to 60 Gy at 1.8 to 2.0 Gy/fraction (to allow for an \nintegrated boost) to the tumor bed.166,167 RT dosing163 is dependent on the \nability to meet normal organ constraints and underlying liver function. If \nSBRT or hypofractionation are not options, conventional fractionation  with \ndoses ranging from 60 Gy per 30 fractions to 77 Gy per 35 fractions168,169 or \nchemoradiation up to 60 Gy per 30 fractions is recommended.158 The \npreferred dosing schedule for SBRT for unresectable disease is 40 to 60 \nGy, typically done in 3 to 5 fractions, if dose constraints can be met.163,170 \nData from prospective studies support the use of hepatic arterial infusion \n(HAI) chemotherapy in patients with advanced, liver -confined, and \nunresectable intrahepatic CCA .171- 175 In a phase II trial of HAI of floxuridine PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

A prospective single arm phase II trial investigated the use \nof gemcitabine and cisplatin along with HAI of floxuridine in 50 patients \nwith advanced intrahepatic CCA confined to the liver.\n177 At a median \nfollow- up of 26.4 months, the median OS was 22.1 months, the median \nPFS was 10 months. The 1 -year and 2 -year OS rates were 80% and \n28.6% , respectively. In a meta -analysis including 20 studies ( N = 657), HAI \nwas compared to TACE, DEB -TACE, and TARE with Y90  microspheres.178 \nOS and tumor response were greatest for HAI, with a median tumor \nresponse rate of 57%, al though grade III/IV toxicity was also highest, \nrelative to the other arterially directed therapies. A retrospective analysis of 525 patients with intrahepatic CCA  showed that patients who received a \ncombined regimen of HAI and another chemotherapy agent (gemcitabine, \nirinotecan, or 5- FU) had greater OS, relative to patients receiving \nchemotherapy without HAI (30.8 vs. 18.4 months ; P < .001).\n179 In a \nretrospective analysis comparing HAI chemotherapy with m odified \nFOLFOX (mFOLFOX; fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin)  to first-line \nsystemic therapy in patients with unresectable intrahepatic CCA, the \nmedian OS and PFS did not differ.180 However, the authors note that \nintrahepatic PFS was improved in those receiving HAI chemotherapy ( P = \n.035). Subgroup analysis revealed that HAI chemotherapy was more \nbeneficial for patients with single tumors in terms of OS ( P = .047) and PFS \n(P = .009).  \nBased on the available evidence as discussed above, the P anel has \nincluded locoregional therapy as a treatment option that may be considered for patients with unresectable disease or metastatic cancer without \nextrahepatic disease. HAI chemotherapy , with or without systemic \nchemotherapy,  may be used in the context of a clinical trial or at experienced centers in carefully selected cases for patients with advanced \ndisease confined to the liver.  \nManagement of Mixed HCC -CCA \nAn estimated 1% to 10% of patients with primary liver tumors are found to have a combination of both HCC and CCA histologies on pathologic \nreview.\n181- 184 Tumor molecular profiling should be considered in all patients \nwith advanced stages of disease to identify potential targeted aberrations, \nwhich may be associated with CCA.185 Liver resection is considered the \nstandard treatment for resectable disease. Though prospective data are lacking, liver -directed local therapies may be appropriate for patients with a \nlimited extent of unresectable hepatic disease. Patients with HCC- CCA that \nis limited in size based on center -specific criteria used should be \nconsidered for evaluation in a transplant center. In patients with metastatic \nor locally -advanced recurrence after a prior resection or local therapies, a \nrepeat biopsy should be consi dered to ascertain the dominant histology at \nrecurrence. If biopsy results at recurrence suggests an isolated recurrence \nof either the HCC or CCA component, the Panel considers a systemic \ntherapy option appropriate for that histologic component.  There are limited \nprospective data to guide treatment decisions for advanced disease.  \nA retrospective study of patients with mixed HCC -CCA treated with \npalliative systemic therapy demonstrated similar overall response rates \n(ORRs ) with chemotherapy versus non -chemotherapy -based systemic \ntherapies.\n186 There was a trend towards longer median OS in patients \ntreated with chemotherapy (15.5 vs. 5.3 months; P = .052).  Based upon \nthis study and the potential for activity of component parts in both \nhistologies, gemcitabine plus cisplatin combined with either durvalumab or \npembrolizumab is an appropriate choice for first -line therapy.

The reported 5- year survival \nrates following complete resection are in the range of 20% to 42% and 16% to 52%, respectively, for patients with hilar and distal CCAs .\n198,199 \nSurgical margin status and lymph node metastases are independent predictors of survival following resection.\n111,200,201 Regional \nlymphadenectomy of the porta hepatis (hilar CCA ) or in the area of the \nhead of the pancreas (distal CCA ) are considered standard parts of \ncurative resections.202,203 Since these surgical procedures are associated \nwith postoperative morbidity, they should be carried out in patients who are \nmedically fit for a major operation. Surgery is contraindicated in patients \nwith distant metastatic disease to the liver, peritoneum, or distant lymph \nnodes beyond the porta hepatis (or head of the pancreas for dis tal tumors).  \nThe type of surgical procedure for a resectable tumor is based on its \nanatomic location in the biliary tract. Resection of the involved biliary tract \nand en bloc liver resection (typically a major hepatectomy involving the \nright or left liver with the caudate lobe) is recommended for hilar tumors. \nBile duct excision with frozen section assessment of proximal and distal \nbile duct margins . Pancreaticoduodenectomy can be attempted for mid bile \nduct tumors not involving the liver or pancreas. However, mid bile duct tumors that can be completely resected with an isolated bile duct resection \nare uncommon. A combined pancreaticoduodenectomy and hepatic \nresection is required, in rare instances, for  a bile duct tumor with extensive \nbiliary tract involvement. This operation, however, is associated with high morbidity and should only be considered in well -selected cases.\n204,205 Combined hepatic and pancreatic resections to clear distant nodal disease \n(as opposed to biliary extent) are not recommended, as these are highly \nmorbid procedures with no obvious associated survival advantage.  The \nguidelines recommend consideration of biliary drainage prior to definitive \nresection for patients with jaundice  prior to instituting systemic therapy . \nHowever, caution should be exercised in patients with hilar biliary obstruction as drainage is not always simple and can be associated with \nsignificant morbidity.\n206 Decisions about whether preoperative biliary \ndrainage is appropriate (and the type of drainage) should be made by a \nmultidisciplinary team at a n experienced  high- volume center.  \nIn patients with hilar CCA , extended hepatic resection (to encompass the \nbiliary confluence)  (usually  with caudate lobectomy ) is recommended, since \nhilar tumors, by definition, abut or invade the central portion of the liver. The recommendation for extended liver resection is supported by \nretrospective analyses showing a higher rate of R0 resection, prolonged \nsurvival, and decreased hepatic recurrence associated with extended \nhepatic resections as compared to bile duct resections.\n207- 211 Resection and \nreconstruction of the portal vein and/or hepatic artery may be necessary for \ncomplete resection, especially in patients with more advanced disease. \nThis approach requires substantial experience and appropriate surgical \nsupport for such technical operations.212,213 For adjuvant treatment of \nresected hilar CCA , see the section on Adjuvant Chemotherapy and \nChemoradiation for Biliary Tract Cancers . \nPatient selection for surgery is facilitated by careful preoperative staging, surgical exploration, biopsy, and consideration of diagnostic laparoscopy to \nidentify patients with unresectable or distant metastatic disease. A \npreoperative biopsy is not neces sary if the index of suspicion is high. \nLaparoscopy can identify the majority of patients with occult metastatic hilar CCA , albeit with a lower yield.

Patients with \nunresectable or metastatic disease should be considered for biliary \ndrainage using either surgical bypass (although rarely used) or ERCP or \nPTC, most often involving biliary stent place ment.222-225  \nIn patients with unresectable or metastatic disease, biopsy is \nrecommended to confirm the diagnosis prior to the initiation of further \ntreatment . For patients with unresectable disease, biopsy is recommended \nonly after determining transplant status  as transperitoneal and surgical \nbiopsy may be contraindicated in transplant candidates . Molecular testing \nis recommended to potentially guide targeted treatment. Primary treatment \noptions for these patients include: systemic therapy , clinical trial,  or best \nsupportive care. In addition, combination of chemotherapy and chemoradiation, chemoradiation, and palliative RT  are also included as \noptions for patients with unresectable disease. Data to support particular \nchemoradiation and chemotherapy regimens are limited. See sections on \nChemotherapy and Chemoradiation and Radiation Therapy for  Treatment \nof Advanced Biliary Tract Cancers . Following primary treatment, except for \nthose receiving best supportive care, the disease should be assessed for \nresponse. Resection or locoregional therapy should be reconsidered. \nSubsequent -line systemic therapy is an option if there is progression on or  \nafter systemic therapy.  \nLiver transplantation is a potentially curative option for selected patients \nwith lymph node- negative, non -disseminated, locally advanced hilar \nCCAs .\n226-229 There is retrospective evidence suggesting that neoadjuvant  chemoradiation followed by liver transplantation is effective for selected \npatients with hilar CCA ; particularly in patients with primary sclerosing \ncholangitis .230- 232 Results from two studies suggest that the combination of \nliver transplantation and neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemoradiation is associated with higher RFS than a potentially curative resection.\n233,234 \nHowever, in one of these studies, there were substantial differences in the characteristics of patients in the two treatment groups.\n233 It is important to \nnote that many of these reports include patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, and some have not had a definitive histologic cancer diagnosis. \nLiver transplantation should be considered only for highly selected patients \n(ie, tumo r ≤3 cm in radial diameter, no intrahepatic or extrahepatic \nmetastases, no nodal disease) with either unresectable disease with \notherwise normal biliary and hepatic function or underlying chronic liver \ndisease precluding surgery. The P anel encourages conti nuation of clinical \nresearch in this area, and referral of patients with unresectable disease to a \ntransplant center with a  United Network for Organ Sharing- approved \nprotocol for transplant of CCA  should be considered.  \nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is an  ablative therapy that involves \nintravenous injection of a photosensitizing drug followed by selective \nirradiation with light of a specific wavelength to initiate localized drug \nactivation, and has been used for palliation in patients with extrahepatic \nCCA .

The role of adjuvant \nchemotherapy or chemoradiation therap y in patients with resected BTCs is \npoorly defined, with a lack of data from multiple phase III randomized \ncontrolled trials.166,239 Due to the low incidence of BTCs, the efficacy and \nsafety of adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy in these \npatients have been primarily evaluated in retrospective studies that have \nincluded only a small number of patients. Further, these studies often \ncombined patients with gallbladder and bile duct cancers (with a few \nexceptions), which may be problematic since the biology of these tumors is \ncompletely different. Despite the challenges associated with the accrual of \nlarge numbers of patients wi th BTC for randomized phase III trials, it is \nwidely recognized that efforts should be made to conduct such studies in which the individual disease entities are evaluated separately.  \nData supporting adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resected BTC have come from two randomized phase III trials. In the phase III BILCAP \nstudy, 447 patients with R0/R1 resected CCA or gallbladder cancer were randomized to receive either adjuvant capecitabine or observation.\n240 RFS \nwas significantly greater for patients in the capecitabine arm in both the \nintent -to-treat analysis (24.4 vs. 17.5 months; HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58– 0.98; \nP = .033) and in the per -protocol analysis ( N = 430; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, \n0.54– 0.92; P = .009). The primary endpoint of median OS was 51.1 months \nfor the capecitabine arm and 36.4 months for the observation arm. This difference was statistically significant in the per -protocol analysis (HR, 0.75; \n95% CI, 0.58– 0.97; P = .028) but not in the primary intent -to-treat analysis. \nData from a long- term analysis in the intent -to-treat population determined \na median OS of 49.6 months for the capecitabine arm and 36.1 months for the observation arm (adjusted HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67– 1.06).\n241 A hazard \nratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.59– 0.94) was reported in the protocol -specified \nsensitivity analysis. In the STAMP randomized study from South Korea, \nadjuvant gemcitabine and capecitabine did not improve disease -free \nsurvival at 2 years and median OS, w hen compared to capecitabine, in \npatients with lymph node -positive extrahepatic CCA following resection.242   \nIn a phase III randomized trial reported in 2002, 508 patients with resected \npancreaticobiliary cancer (139 patients had CCA and 140 patients had \ngallbladder cancer)  were randomly assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy \nwith fluorouracil and mitomycin C or to a control arm.243 Results from \nunplanned subgroup analyses showed a significantly better 5- year \ndisease- free survival for patients with gallbladder cancer treated with \nchemotherapy (20.3% compared to 11.6% in the control group; P  = .021), \nalthough no significant differences between the two treatment arms were \nobserved for all patients with biliary tract cancers. Results from this trial \nsuggested that patients with gallbladder cancer undergoing resection may \nderive survival benefit  with adjuvant chemotherapy but the gallbladder \ncohort on the BILCAP trial did not see a similar benefit on exploratory analysis.\n241,243 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBiliary Tract Cancers  \nMS-20 A randomized phase III trial from Japan investigated whether S -1, an oral \nfluoropyrimidine derivative given as adjuvant therapy, benefited patients \nwith BTCs who underwent R0/R1 resection.244 Compared to patients \ntreated with surgery alone, patients treated with adjuvant S -1 had a \nsignificantly improved 3 -year OS (adjusted HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51– 0.94; P \n= .008). However, the 3- year RFS rate was not significantly higher (HR, \n0.80; 95% CI, 0.61– 1.04; P = .088). Furthermore, S -1 is not available in the \nUnited States.  \nNegative results were reported from gemcitabine- based regimens in two \nrandomized phase III trials. In the phase III PRODIGE 12- ACCORD 18 trial, \n196 patients with R0/R1 resected BTC were randomized to receive \nGEMOX or surveillance alone.245 No statistically significant differences \nwere found between the study arms for RFS and OS. In another phase III \ntrial from Japan, adjuvant gemcitabine monotherapy (compared to \nobservation) in 226 patients with resected extrahepatic CCA reported no \ndifference in survival.246  \nRetrospective studies that have combined patients with gallbladder cancer \nand CCAs provide conflicting evidence regarding the role of adjuvant \ntherapy.247- 249 It should be noted that the majority of recurrences after \nresection of gallbladder cancer involve distant sites, supporting the idea of \ndeveloping effective adjuvant systemic therapies.247 \nIn a systematic review and meta- analysis of 6712 patients with BTCs, \nHorgan et al reported an associated improvement in OS (although \nnonsignificant) with adjuvant therapy compared with surgery alone, with no \ndifference between patients with gallbladder cancer and bile duct \ncancers.250 Chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy was associated with \nstatistically greater benefit than RT alone, with the greatest benefit observed in patients with lymph node- positive disease and macroscopic \nresidual disease (R1 resection). Another systematic rev iew and \nmeta -analysis of 42,917 patients found a significantly higher OS with adjuvant therapy after surgery compared with surgery alone.\n251 Ren et al \nreported a higher 5 -year OS with adjuvant RT compared to surgery only in \npatients with gallbladder cancer or extrahepatic CCA in a meta -analysis of \n21 clinical trials.252  \nIn studies that included only patients with gallbladder cancer, a meta-analysis of 10 retrospective studies with 3191 patients showed that \nadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved OS, compared to \nresection alone (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22– 0.80).\n253 Subgroup analyses \nshowed that the patients who are most likely to benefit from adjuvant \ntherapy include those with a positive margin, nodal disease, or at least \nstage II disease. Retrospective studies have concluded that adjuvant \nchemotherapy or chemoradi ation following R0 resection might improve OS \nin selected patients with T2 or T3 tumors and lymph node- positive \ngallbladder cancer.254- 257  \nRetrospective studies that included only patients with resected extrahepatic \nCCA suggest that adjuvant chemoradiation may improve local control and \nsurvival, although distant metastases was the most common pattern of \nrecurrence.258- 261 Other studies have suggested that adjuvant \nchemoradiation may have a significant survival benefit only in a subgroup of patients with T3 or T4 tumors or those with a high risk of locoregional \nrecurrence (R1 resection or positive lymph nodes).\n260,262,263 \nMost of the collective experience of chemoradiation in BTCs involves \nconcurrent chemoradiation and fluorouracil. The phase II SWOG S0809 \ntrial, which enrolled patients with extrahepatic CCA or gallbladder cancer \n(N = 79), provided prospective data on adjuvant \nchemotherapy/chemoradiation (ie, capecitabine/gemcitabine followed by concurrent capecitabine and RT).\n164 Two-year OS was 65%, and median \nsurvival was 35 months. A majority of patients enrolled in the trial (86%) \ncompleted therapy, and the regimen was generally tolerable.

Concurrent chemoradiation \nwith capecitabine has been used in other studies.260,265 Concurrent \nchemoradiation with gemcitabine is not recommended due to the limited \nexperience and toxicity associated with this treatment.266  \nAmong patients with cancer of the gallbladder or extrahepatic bile duct, those who have undergone an R0 resection and who have negative \nregional nodes or those with carcinoma in situ at margin may be followed \nwith systemic therapy (preferred), clinical tri al (preferred), observation \nalone, or chemoradiation (category 2B for patients with gallbladder cancer). \nPatients with intrahepatic CCA who have undergone an R0 resection may \nbe followed with systemic therapy (preferred), clinical trial (preferred), or \nobservation.  \nPatients with gallbladder cancer or extrahepatic CCA with resected, \npositive margins (R1) or gross residual disease (R2) or those with \nintrahepatic CCA with gross residual disease (R2) after resection should be \nevaluated by a multidisciplinary team to review the av ailable treatment \noptions on a case -by-case basis. Evaluation and treatment of gross \nresidual disease (R2) should be consistent with evaluation and treatment \nfor unresectable disease. For patients with R1 margins or positive regional \nnodes, the op timal treatment strategy has not been established but options \nare systemic therapy (preferred), clinical trial (preferred), combination of chemotherapy and chemoradiation, or chemoradiation.  \nThere are limited data to support a specific chemoradiation regimen or \ndefinitive benefit. If RT is used, then RT using 3D conformal RT and \nintensity -modulated RT are options.\n164,165 Dosing schedules may depend on \nmargin positivity and may include up to 45 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fraction or 50 to 60 \nGy at 1.8 to 2.0 Gy/fraction (to allow for an integrated boost) to the tumor \nbed.166,167 RT dosing163 is dependent on the ability to meet normal organ \nconstraints and underlying liver function. If SBRT or hypofractionation are not options, conventional fractionation with doses ranging from 60 Gy per \n30 fractions to 77 Gy per 35 fractions168,169 or chemoradiation up to 60 Gy \nper 30 fractions is recommended.158 The preferred dosing schedule for \nSBRT for unresectable disease is 40 to 60 Gy, typically done in 3 to 5 \nfractions, if dose constraints can be met.163,170 \nRecommended adjuvant chemotherapy regimens include capecitabine monotherapy (category 1); gemcitabine monotherapy or combined with \ncisplatin or capecitabine; and 5 -fluououracil monotherapy. Capecitabine \nmonotherapy is preferred while all other options are included as other recommended regimens. If a patient is ineligible for cisplatin, carboplatin \nmay be used.\n267 Besides capecitabine monotherapy, whose use in this \nsetting is supported by the pre -specified secondary endpoint of the phase \nIII BILCAP study,240 data to support particular chemotherapy regimens for \nadjuvant treatment of resected BTC are limited and are based on the extrapolation of data from studies of patients with advanced disease. \nAdditionally, some of the recommendations are based on practice patterns \nat NCCN Member Institutions and retrospective studies from single- center \nexperiences. The recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines on the use of \nadjuvant chemotherapy are not specific to the particular type of BTC, due \nto the limited data and the heterogeneity of patient populations included in \nmany of the published studies.  \nTreatment for Advanced Biliary Tract Cancers \nThe prognosis of patients with advanced BTCs is poor and the median \nsurvival for those undergoing supportive care alone is short.268 Treatment \noptions for advanced BTCs may include systemic therapy, enrollment in a \nclinical trial, combination of chemotherapy and chemoradiation, \nchemoradiation, palliative RT, consideration of locoregional therapy \n(arterially directed therapies or RT), c onsideration of referral to a transplant \ncenter, and best supportive care, depending on the disease stage and \nspecific disease subtype.

Following an \nupdated analysis, the authors report an updated median OS of 12.9 months for patients treated with durvalumab in combination with gemcitabine and \ncisplatin, compared to 11.3 months for those treated with placebo in \ncombination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64–\n0.91).269 Decreased neutrophil count (treatment group, 21%; control group, \n25%), anemia (19% in both groups), and neutropenia (treatment group, \n19%; control group, 20%) were the most frequent grade 3 or 4 treatment -\nrelated adverse events.  \nThe phase III randomized KEYNOTE -966  trial investigated the combination \nof pembrolizumab with gemcitabine and cisplatin compared to the \ncombination of placebo with gemcitabine and cisplatin in 1069 patients with \nunresectable, locally advanced, or metastati c BTC with no prior treatment.187 In the intention- to-treat population, there was a significant \nimprovement in the primary endpoint of OS, with a median OS of 12.7 \nmonths in the treatment group and a median OS of 10.9 months in the \ncontrol group (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72– 0.95; P = .0034).

Similar results were obtained in the final analysis for PFS. Both \ngroups had an ORR of 29% at the first interim analysis. 70% of patients \ntreated with pembrolizumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin \nexperienced a grade 3 or 4 treatment -related adverse event compared to \n69% of patients treated with placebo in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin.  \nBased on these data, the Panel has included combination therapy with durvalumab plus gemcitabine plus cisplatin, as well as combination therapy \nwith pembrolizumab plus gemcitabine plus cisplatin, as category 1 \npreferred recommendations for the first -line s ystemic treatment of \nunresectable or metastatic BTCs.

The corresponding \nPFS was 2.8, 3.5, and 8.5 months ( P < .001).   \nSeveral phase II studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of \nchemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced BTCs.\n272,273 The \nresults of a pooled analysis of 104 trials that have included 2810 patients with advanced BTCs showed that response rates and tumor control were \nhigher for the subgroup of patients receiving a combination of gemcitabine \nand platinum -based agents.\n274 In a retrospective study of 304 patients with \nunresectable BTCs who were treated with gemcitabine alone, a \ncisplatin -based regimen, or a fluoropyrimidine- based regimen, patients \nreceiving gemcitabine were shown to have a lower risk of death.275 Most \nimportantly, the support for the use of gemcitabine- based or \nfluoropyrimidine- based chemotherapy for patients with advanced BTCs \ncomes from four randomized studies.189,276 -278 A phase II study comparing \nmodified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX; fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan \nand oxaliplatin) to gemcitabine plus cisplatin in patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic BTCs did not achieve its primary endpoint of PFS \nat 6 months i n the modified intention- to-treat population.279 \nThe randomized, controlled, phase III ABC -02 study, which enrolled 410 \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic CCA, gallbladder cancer, or \nampullary cancer, demonstrated that the combination of gemcitabine and \ncisplatin improved OS and PFS by 30% over  gemcitabine alone.189 Median \nOS was 11.7 months and 8.1 months (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52– 0.80; P < \n.001), and median PFS was 8.0 months versus 5.0 months (HR, 0.63; 95% \nCI, 0.51 –0.77; P < .001), both in favor of the combination arm. Although the \nrate of neutropenia was higher in the group receiving gemcitabine and cisplatin, there was no significant difference in the rate of neutropenia- associated infections between the two arms. Okusaka et al \nalso reported similar findings in a phase II randomized study of 84 patients with advanced BTCs.\n278 If a patient is ineligible for cisplatin, carboplatin \nmay be used. A phase II study with 48 patients with advanced BTCs \nrevealed that 31.1% of evaluable patients treated with gemcitabine plus \ncarboplatin had an overall response, with a median OS and PFS o f 10.6 \nand 7.8 months, respectively.267 \nResults from the randomized phase III ABC -06 study showed that \ncompared to active symptom control alone, active symptom control \ncombined with FOLFOX in patients previously treated with combined \ncisplatin and gemcitabine improved the primary endpoint of median OS (6.2 \nvs. 5.3 months; adjusted HR, 0.69; P =  .031).280 FOLFOX is a preferred \nsubsequent -line systemic therapy option for unresectable or metastatic \nprogressive disease. Second- line treatment with fluorouracil and irinotecan \n(FOLFIRI) also provided some benefits to patients (median PFS, 1.7 \nmonths [95% CI, 0.66 –2.67 months]; median OS, 5 months [95% CI, 2.77–\n7.20 months]).281 A retrospective analysis of patients with advanced BTCs \ntreated with FOLFIRI also demonstrated some efficacy (median OS, 6.6 months [95% CI, 4.7– 8.4 months]; median PFS, 2.4 months [95% CI, 1.7–\n3.1 months]).\n282 Patients treated with concurrent bevacizumab or EGFR -\ntargeted therapy had a median PFS of 2.7 months.

The results showed that switch \nmaintenance improved PFS (median PFS of 3.1 months for the active \nsurveillance group vs. 5.3 months for the switch maintenance group; HR, \n0.51; P = .0013).  \nBased on the experiences from phase II or phase III studies, the following \ngemcitabine- based and fluoropyrimidine- based combination chemotherapy \nregimens are included as other recommended options for the treatment of patients with advanced BTCs: gemcitabine with cisplatin (category 1 in the \nfirst-line setting), capecitabine with oxaliplatin; FOLFOX (preferred regimen \nin the subsequent -line setting); gemcitabine combined with albumin -bound \npaclitaxel; gemcitabine with capecitabine or oxaliplatin; and single- agent \nfluorouracil, capecitabine, and gemcitabine. If a patient is ineligible for \ncisplatin, carboplatin may be used.\n267 The combination of gemcitabine and \nfluorouracil is not included due to the increased toxicity and decreased \nefficacy observed with this regimen296 when compared with results of \nstudies of the gemcitabine and capecitabine regimen in the setting of advanced BTC.  \nChemoradiation and Radiation Therapy  \nChemoradiation in the setting of advanced BTCs can provide control of symptoms due to local tumor effects and may prolong OS. However, there \nare limited clinical trial data to define a standard regimen or definitive \nbenefit. In a retrospective analysis of 37 patients treated with chemoradiation for unresectable extrahepatic CCA, the actuarial OS rates \nat 1 and 2 years were 59% and 22%, respectively, although effective local \ncontrol was observed in the majority of patients during this time period \n(actuarial local control rates of 90% and 71% at 1 and 2 years, \nrespectively).\n315 The most extensively investigated chemotherapeutic agent \nfor use in concurrent chemoradiation in the treatment of BTCs has been \nfluorouracil,316,317 although capecitabine has been substituted for \nfluorouracil in some studies.265 The Panel recommends that concurrent \nchemoradiation (RT guided by imaging) should be limited to either 5 -\nfluorouracil or capecitabine, and that such treatment should be restricted to \npatients without evidence of metastatic disease. Concurrent \nchemoradiati on with gemcitabine is not recommended due to the limited \nexperience and toxicity associated with this treatment.  \nEvidence supports the consideration of RT for treatment of unresectable \nand metastatic intrahepatic CCA,158,160,161,318 but there is little evidence to \nsupport this treatment option for gallbladder cancer and extrahepatic CCA \nwithout concurrent chemotherapy and in patients with unresected \ndisease.319,320  \nTargeted Therapy  \nBTCs are known to harbor clinically relevant molecular alterations that are \ndifferentially expressed in gallbladder cancer and intrahepatic and \nextrahepatic CCAs. The rarity of individual subgroups limits precise \nincidence and frequency estimates. Given em erging evidence regarding \nactionable targets for treating BTCs, comprehensive molecular profiling is recommended for patients with unresectable or metastatic BTC who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy (see Principles of Molecular Testing  in the \nalgorithm for additional information regarding testing modalities and \nconsiderations).\n321 While most BTCs are considered sporadic, up to 10% to \n15% of BTCs may be associated with an inherited cancer predisposition \nsyndrome.322,323 As evidence remains insufficient for definitive PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

For \npatients who harbor a known germline mutation associated with a cancer predisposing syndrome (ie, Lynch syndrome or hereditary breast and \novarian cancer syndrome), there is currently insufficient evidence to \nsupport screening for biliary tract malignancies.  \nNTRK Fusions  \nNTRK is a membrane- bound receptor that autophosphorylates and \nactivates downstream pathways that drive oncogenesis. NTRK1/NTRK2/NTRK3  fusions are estimated to occur at <1% prevalence \nin BTCs.\n324,325 Three NTRK inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for a \ntumor agnostic indication in NTRK  fusion -positive solid tumors: \nlarotrectinib326 in 2018, entrectinib327 in 2019, and repotrectinib328 in 2024. \nStudies with entrectinib and larotrectinib have demonstrated response rates \nin the 57% to 75% range in pre -treated NTRK  fusion- positive tumors.325- 327 \nThese studies included small numbers of patients with CCA and demonstrated evidence of clinical benefit. Abstract data for repotrectinib \nshowed a confirmed ORR of 50% in patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitor -\npretreated NTRK  fusion- positive solid tumors.\n328 Entrectinib, larotrectinib, \nand repotrectinib are useful in certain circumstances first -line or \nsubsequent -line (for progressive disease) systemic therapy options for \nunresectable or metastatic NTRK  gene fusion- positive tumors. In the \nsubsequent -line setting, repotrectinib is an option if there was progression \non a prior therapy, which may include prior NTRK inhibitors; entrectinib and \nlarotrectinib should not be used if there was progression on prior NTRK \ninhibitors.  Testing for NTRK  fusions is recommended for patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic CCA, or extrahepatic CCA. \nThese assessments are feasible in the context of multi -target assessment \nin next -generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels current ly in clinical use \nand NTRK fusion- positive CCAs have demonstrated responses in clinical \ntrials.  \nImmunotherapy Biomarkers (MSI -H/dMMR/TMB -H/PD -L1) \nMismatch repair (MMR) deficiency results from somatic alterations in \nMLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are genes encoding proteins that \nregulate DNA repair. MMR deficiency results in a unique genetic \nsignature characterized by high rates of mutations, particularly in \nrepetitive DNA sequences called microsatellites that occur throughout the \ngenome. Thi s signature is referred to as MSI or MSI -H. MSI -H or \nmismatch repair deficient (dMMR) status is rare in BTCs and has an approximate incidence of 1% to 3%.\n329- 331 \n \nTumor mutational burden (TMB) is defined as the total number of somatic \nmutations per coding area of a tumor’s genome. Higher rates of tumor \nmutation may result in increased production of immunogenic mutant \nproteins or neoantigens.331- 336 The incidence of TMB -high (TMB -H) has \nbeen shown to be <5% across studies.321,337 \n \nThe programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) system functions to inhibit T \ncell functions. PD -L1 protein expression on malignant or inflammatory \nassociated tumor cells generally indicates active tumor immunity \nsuppressed by the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1)/PD -L1 \nsystem. In BTCs, PD -L1 high status ranges from around 45% to 65% for \ncombined tumor plus immune cell PD -L1 expression ≥1%, and 10% to \n70% for tumor cell PD -L1 expression ≥1%.331,333  \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBiliary Tract Cancers  \nMS-27 MSI-H or MMR deficiency are predictive of substantially higher rates of \ndurable, objective response to immune checkpoint inhibition in patients \nacross a range of solid tumor types in studies that have included patients \nwith BTCs.329,333,338,339  In the KEYNOTE- 158 trial, 233 patients with MSI -H \nor dMMR non -colorectal solid tumor types after failure of standard \ntherapy, including 22 patients with CCA, demonstrated an ORR of 34.3% \n(95% CI, 28.3% –40.8%) with median PFS of 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.4– 4.9 \nmonths) and median OS of 23.5 months (95% CI, 13.5 months –not \nreached).338 Grade 3– 5 treatment -related adverse events were observed \nin 14.6% of patients. Analyses of a CCA subgroup ( N = 22) revealed an \nORR of 40.9% (95% CI, 20.7% –63.6%) with a median PFS and OS of 4.2 \nmonths (95% CI, 2.1 months –not reached) and 24.3 months (95% CI, 6.5 \nmonths –not reached), respectively. The results from an updated analysis \nshowed that out of 351 patient s with advanced MSI -H/dMMR \nnoncolorectal solid tumors who received prior treatment, 30.8% (95% CI, \n25.8% –36.2% achieved an overall response.339 The median PFS, median \nOS, and median duration of response (DOR) were 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.3–4.2 months), 20.1 months (95% CI, 14.1– 27.1 months), and 47.5 \nmonths (95% CI, 2.1+ to 51.1+ months), respectively. Twelve percent  of \npatients experienced a grade 3– 5 treatment -related adverse event. In the \nCCA/biliary tract subgroup, the ORR was the same as previously reported. The median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.1 –24.9 months) \nand the median OS was 19.4 months (95% CI, 6.5 mon ths–not reached). \nThese findings  contributed to the FDA approval of pembrolizumab for \npatients with unresectable or metastatic MSI -H or dMMR solid tumors, as \ndetermined by an FDA -approved test, which  have progressed following \nprior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment \noptions, agnostic to tumor histology.\n \n In the KEYNOTE -158 trial, 102 of 805 evaluable patients were found to \nhave tumors with TMB -H status, defined as ≥10 mutations/megabase of \nDNA based upon the platform used; objective radiographic responses occurred in 29%  of patients (95% CI, 21% –39%) by comparison with only \n6% of patients (95% CI, 5% –8%) in the non- TMB -H group.\n332 These \nfindings led to a histology -agnostic FDA approval of pembrolizumab for \npatients with TMB -H advanced solid tumors that have progressed \nfollowing prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative \ntreatment options. Though none of the 63 BTC pat ients in the KEYNOTE -\n158 TMB cohort were found to harbor TMB -H tumors, other studies have \nshown that approximately 4% of advanced BTCs have TMB -H tumors, \nsupporting testing for TMB in this population.331,334   \nPembrolizumab is a useful in certain circumstances first -line or \nsubsequent -line (for progressive disease and with no prior treatment with a \ncheckpoint inhibitor) systemic therapy option for unresectable or metastatic \nMSI-H, dMMR, or TMB -H (for subsequent -line therapy only) BTCs, though \nthe Panel cautions that data to support this recommendation are limited, \nparticularly in the first -line setting.340 \nDostarlimab -gxly, another anti -PD-1 antibody, was assessed in the open -\nlabel phase I GARNET study with 2 cohorts.341 One cohort had patients \nwith advanced or recurrent MSI -H/dMMR endometrial cancer and another \nhad patients with advanced or recurrent MSI -H/dMMR or POL E-mutated \nnon-endometrial solid tumors. The ORR for the cohort with non -endometrial \ncancer was 43.1% (95% CI, 36.2% –50.2%). The median DOR and median \nOS were not reached at the time of follow up and the median PFS was 7.1 \nmonths. The most frequent grade 3 or higher treatment -emergent adverse \nevents were anemia (2.5%), increased lipase (1.3%), and increased alanine aminotransferase (1.9%). Dostarlimab- gxly is a category 2B useful \nin certain circumstances subsequent -line systemic therapy option for \npatients with MSI -H/dMMR recurrent or advanced tumors that have \nprogressed on or following prior treatment, who hav e no satisfactory \nalternative treatment options, and who have not been previously treated \nwith a checkpoint inhibitor.

The data revealed an ORR of 38.6% (95% CI, \n28.4% –49.6%) (vs. 29.8% for nivolumab [95% CI, 17.3% –44.9%]), a \nmedian OS of 15.0 months (95% CI, 10.2– 29.8 months) (vs. 14.6 months \nfor nivolumab [95% CI, 7.7–20.7 months]), and a median PFS of 5.7 \nmonths (95% CI, 3.2– 11.6 months) (vs. 2.8 months for nivolumab [95% CI, \n2.7–5.7 months]) in patients with tTMB -H tumors treated with nivolumab \nplus ipilimumab. In patients with bTMB -H tumors treated with nivolumab \nplus ipilimumab, the ORR, median OS, and median PFS were 22.5% (95% CI, 13.9% –33.2%) (vs. 15.6% for nivolumab [95% CI, 6.5% –29.5%]), 8.1 \nmonths (95% CI, 5.8– 10.5 months) (vs. 11.2 months for nivolumab [95% \nCI, 5.3 –19.0 months]), and 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.3–3.0 months) (vs. 2.8 \nmonths for nivolumab [95% CI, 2.6–3.3 months]), respectively. Treatment -\nrelated adverse events occurred in 28.7% of patients with tTMB- H tumors \n(vs. 8.0% for nivolumab) and in 37.3% of patients  with bTMB -H tumors (vs. \n2.1% for nivolumab) treated with the combination therapy. Nivolumab plus \nipilimumab is a useful in certain circumstances first -line (category 2B) or \nsubsequent -line (for progressive disease and with no prior treatment with a \ncheckp oint inhibitor) systemic therapy option for patients with unresectable \nor metastatic TMB -H tumors. In the subsequent -line setting, the \nrecommendation is for patients with disease refractory to standard \ntherapies or who have no standard treatment options av ailable.  \nTesting for MSI or MMR deficiency is recommended in patients with \nunresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic CCA, or \nextrahepatic CCA. Further recommendations for MSI/MMR testing can be \nfound in the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer  (available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). Testing for TMB is recommended for patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic CCA, or \nextrahepatic CCA based upon clinical benefit observed across advanced \nsolid tumors.  \nIn advanced BTCs, tumor or tumor plus immune cell PD- L1 expression \nhas shown trends towards higher rates of objective radiographic response \nin single -arm phase 2 studies of pembrolizumab or nivolumab as \nmonotherapy.333,343 However, ORR rates are low overall and data from \nthese small, uncontrolled studies are insufficient to warrant a \nrecommendation for testing. PD -L1 testing is not used as PD -L1 negative \ndisease can still respond to anti -PD-1/PD -L1 drugs, albeit at a lower rate \nthan PD -L1 positive disease.344 \nIn a phase II trial with 46 evaluable patients with advanced BTCs, an ORR \nof 22% and a disease control rate of 59% were obtained, upon investigator \nassessment, with the use of nivolumab, another anti -PD1 drug.343 With \nblinded independent central review, the ORR was 11% and the disease control rate was 50%. In the intention- to-treat cohort, the median PFS and \nmedian OS were 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.3–5.7 months) and 14.2 months (95% CI, 6.0 months –not reached), respectively. Nivolumab is a category \n2B useful in certain circumstances subsequent -line systemic therapy option \nfor patients with unresectable or metastatic progressive disease who have \nnot been previously treated with a checkpoint inhibitor. Nivolumab and \nhyaluronidase- nvhy subcutaneous injection may be substituted for \nintravenous nivolumab. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase- nvhy has different \ndosing and administration instructions compared to intravenous nivolumab.  \nBRAF V600E Mutations  \nMutation in the BRAF  gene may lead to constitutive activation of the MAPK \npathway. The most common BRAF  mutation is type 1 alteration, which \nresults in a single amino acid substitution of valine at residue 600 typically \nwith glutamic acid (V600E).

Median PFS and \nOS were 9 months (95% CI, 5– 10 months) and 14 months (95% CI, 10– 33 \nmonths), respectively. Results from the Subprotocol H trial, which enrolled \npatients with solid tumors (except for melanoma, thyroid, colorectal cancer, \nand later non- small cell lung cancer) with a BRAF V600E  mutation, \nrevealed an ORR of 38% (90% CI, 22.9% –54.9%; P < .0001) and a PFS of \n11.4 months (90% CI, 8.4– 16.3 months) in 29 patients .349 Dabrafenib plus \ntrametinib received accelerated FDA approval for BRAF  V600E advanced \nsolid tumors. The oral combination of dabrafenib and trametinib is a useful \nin certain circumstances subsequent -line systemic therapy option for \nunresectable or metastatic progressive BRAF  V600E -mutated tumors.  \nTesting for BRAF  V600E mutations is recommended for patients with \nunresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic CCA, or extrahepatic CCA.  \nFGFR2 Fusions/Other FGFR Pathway Aberrations  \nFGFR2 is a member of the FGFR  family of receptor tyrosine kinases that \nactivate a variety of downstream signaling cascades leading to cell \nproliferation and tumorigenesis. FGFR2  fusions or rearrangements occur at \n~9% to 15% prevalence in intrahepatic CCAs and are rare in other subsites.\n337,350,351 Pan-FGFR inhibitors have received accelerated approval \nfrom the FDA for the treatment of pre- treated, locally advanced or \nmetastatic FGFR2 -fusion/rearranged CCA. Results from the phase II \nFOENIX -CA2 trial demonstrated an ORR of 42% (95% CI, 32% –52%) with \nfutibatinib in patients with previously unresectable or metastatic intrahepatic \nCCA with FGFR2  fusions/rearrangements.352 The median OS, median \nPFS, median DOR, and disease control rate were 21.7 months (95% CI, \n14.5 months –not reached), 9.0 months (95% CI, 6.9– 13.1 months), 9.7 months (95% CI, 7.6– 17.0 months), and 83% (95% CI, 74% –89%), \nrespectively. Studies are ongoing to determine the activity of individual \nFGFR inhibitors for specific FGFR  kinase domain activating mutations or \nother FGFR  aberrations. Pemigatinib FDA approval in 2020 was based on \nthe FIGHT -202 study, an open- label study including 108 patients with \nadvanced, pre -treated FGFR2 -fusion- positive or FGFR2- rearranged \nCCA.353,354 The ORR was 37.0% (95% CI, 27.9% –46.9%), with a median \nPFS of 7.0 months (95% CI, 6.1– 10.5 months), a median OS of 17.5 \nmonths (95% CI, 14.4– 22.9 months), and median DOR of 9.1 months (95% \nCI, 6.0 –14.5 months).354  \nThe phase II RAGNAR study investigated the efficacy of erdafitinib, a \nselective pan- FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced or \nmetastatic tumors of any histology (except urothelial cancer) with FGFR 1-4 \nalterations and disease progression on a prior systemic therapy and with \nno alternative standard therapies.355 An objective response was achieved in \n30% (95% CI, 24% –36%) of patients. The median DOR, median OS, and \nmedian PFS were 6.9 months (95% CI, 4.4– 7.1 months), 10.7 months \n(95% CI, 8.7– 12.1 months), and 4.2 months (95% CI, 4.1– 5.5 months), \nrespectively. Fourteen percent  of patients had CCA. For this subset of \npatients, the ORR was 52% (95% CI, 33% –70%). The median DOR, \nmedian OS, and median PFS were 5.5 months (95% CI, 2.9– not \nevaluable), 14.7 months (95% CI, 12.1– 24.3 months), and 8.3 months \n(95% CI, 6.4– 9.7 months), respectively. In addition, interim results from the \nphase II FIDES -01 study were reported in a published abstract.356 \nTreatment with derazantinib, an FGFR 1 -3 inhibitor, resulted in an ORR of \n8.7%, as determined by the investigator, a median PFS of 7.3 months (95% \nCI, 3.5 –16.7 months), and a disease control rate of 73.9% (95% CI, \n51.6% –89.8%) in patients with advanced intrahepatic CCA with FGFR2  \nmutations or amplifications who received prior chemotherapy treatment.

In the intention- to-treat population, the median OS for the ivosidenib and placebo \narms were 10.3 months (95% CI, 7.8– 12.4 months; HR, 0.79 [95% CI, \n0.56– 1.12]; P = .09) and 7.5 months (95% CI, 4.8 –11.1 months), \nrespectively.\n361 After taking into account 43 patients who crossed from the \nplacebo arm to the ivosidenib arm, the median OS for the placebo arm was \n5.1 months (95% CI, 3.8 –7.6 months; HR, .49 [95% CI, 0.34– 0.70]; P < \n.001). Ascites was the most frequently reported grade 3 or higher treatment -emergent adverse event in both groups. Ivosidenib has been approved by the FDA for previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic \nCCA harboring IDH1  mutations. Ivosidenib is a category 1 useful in certain \ncircumstances subsequent -line systemic therapy option for unresectable or \nmetastatic progressive CCA with IDH1  mutations. Clinical trials of next -\ngeneration IDH1 inhibitors are ongoing.   \nTesting for IDH1  mutations is recommended for patients with unresectable \nor metastatic intrahepatic CCA or extrahepatic CCA and should be \nconsidered for patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer.  \nHER2/ERBB2 Overexpression/Amplification/Activating Mutations  \nHER2 ( ERBB2 ) is a member of the ErbB/EGFR  family of receptor tyrosine \nkinases that functions as both a homodimer and heterodimer with other family members to activate a variety of downstream signaling cascades \nleading to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. HER2 overexpression or \npathway activat ion is present in around 5% to 20% of CCAs, and 15% to \n30% of gallbladder cancer.\n351,359,362 -368 Early clinical trials of HER2 -targeted \ntherapy in BTCs failed to show efficacy369,370 but these studies were \nunselected for HER2 overexpression/amplification or mutation.  \n \nSeveral studies have reported promising results of HER2- targeted therapy \nin BTCs.371- 373 In the phase II DESTINY -PanTumor02 trial, treatment with \ntrastuzumab deruxtecan, a HER2 targeted antibody -drug conjugate, in 267 \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 overexpressing tumors \nafter prior systemic treatment or without alternative treatments, resulted in \nimproved outcomes.374 With an ORR of 61.3% (95% CI, 49.4% –72.4%), \nmedian OS, median PFS, and median DOR of 21.1 months (95% CI, 15.3–\n29.6 months), 11.9 months (95% CI, 8.2– 13.0 months), and 22.1 months \n(95% CI, 9.6 months –not reached), respectively, clinical benefit was more \npronounced in patients with HER2 IHC3+ expression. Of 16 patients with \nBTCs with HER IHC3+ expression, the investigator -assessed ORR, median \nOS, and median PFS were 56.3%, 12.4 months, and 7.4 months, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

The results of the phase II HERB trial from Japan showed that \nout of 22 evaluable patients with HER2- positive BTCs refractory or \nintolerant to a gemcitabine- based regimen, 36.4% (95% CI, 19.6% –56.1%) \nachieved a significantly improved confirmed ORR ( P = .01) following \ntreatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan.375 The median OS, PFS, and \ndisease control rate were 7.1 months (95% CI, 4.7% –14.6%), 5.1 months \n(95% CI, 3.0% –7.3%), and 81.8% (95% CI, 59.7% –94.8%), respectively. \nEncouraging data were also reported in patients with HER2- low disease \n(ORR, 12.5%; median OS,  8.9 months; median PFS, 3.5 months; disease \ncontrol rate, 75.0%).  \nJavle et al376 retrospectively reported 8  patients with advanced gallbladder \ncarcinoma harboring HER2 overexpression or amplification treated with \ntrastuzumab (alone or in combination with pertuzumab or chemotherapy); \nall patients experienced disease stability (3), partial response (PR) (4), or \nCR (1). The MyPathway study included 39 patients with HER2 amplified \nand/or overexpressed previously treated, metastatic BTCs.377 Patients \nreceived pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, and 9  patients achieved a PR \n(ORR, 23%; 95% CI, 11% –39%) with an additional 11 patients showing SD \nfor >4 months. In the TAPUR study, out of 28 evaluable patients with \nadvanced BTC with an ERBB2/3  alteration treated with pertuzumab plus \ntrastuzumab, 32% (95% CI, 16% –52%) had an objective response.378 The \ndisease control rate was 40% (90% CI, 27% –100%). Additionally, a \nprospective pilot study of a trastuzumab biosimilar (trastuzumab- pkrb) in \ncombination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin) included 4  \npatients with BTC and identified a PR in 2 patients and SD in 2  patients.379  \nIn the phase II SGNTUC -019 study, 46.7% (90% CI, 30.8% –63.0%) of \npatients with HER2 -positive metastatic BTCs treated with tucatinib and \ntrastuzumab as subsequent therapy achieved the primary endpoint \n(confirmed ORR).380 The disease control rate was 76.7% (90% CI, 60.6% –88.5%), with a median DOR and PFS of 6.0 months (90% CI, 5.5– 6.9 \nmonths) and 5.5 months (90% CI, 3.9– 8.1 months), respectively.  \nThe phase IIb HERIZON -BTC-01 trial investigated the efficacy of \nzanidatamab, a HER2- targeted bispecific antibody, in patients with HER2 -\namplified unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic BTC whose disease progressed following prior treatment with a gemcitabine- based therapy.\n381 \nPatient were assigned to 2 cohorts: cohort 1 (IHC2+ or IHC3+) and cohort \n2(IHC0 or IHC1+). In cohort 1, 41.3% (95% CI. 30.4% –52.8%) of patients \nachieved the primary endpoint of confirmed ORR, as assessed by independent central review. The disease control rate was 68.8% (95% CI, \n57.4% –78.7%), and the median DOR and median PFS were 12.9 months \n(95% CI, 6. 0 months –not estimable) and 5.5 months (3.7– 7.2 months), \nrespectively. A subgroup analysis of cohort 1 showed responses in all 3 subtypes examined (gallbladder cancer ORR, 46.3%; intrahepatic CCA \nORR, 30.4%; extrahepatic CCA, 43.8%). Additionally, the response was \nmore pronounced in patients with IHC3+ tumors (51.6%) compared to \nthose with IHC2+ tumors (5.6%).   \nOf 25 patients with BTCs in the SUMMIT trial, a phase II basket trial \nincluding patients with tumors with HER2 mutations treated with neratinib, \n16% had a confirmed objective response.\n382 First-line treatment of patients \nwith HER2 -positive BTC (96% of whom had gallbladder cancer and 78% of \nwhom had ≥2 metastatic sites) with gemcitabine and cisplatin plus \ntrastuzumab yielded a median PFS of 7 months (95% CI, 6.2– 7.8 months) \nand a PFS rate of 75.6% (95% CI, 66.6% –84.6%) at 6 months.383  \nFam-trastuzumab deruxtecan- nxki (for IHC3+ tumors), trastuzumab plus \npertuzumab (for IHC3+/ISH+/NGS amplification tumors), tucatinib plus \ntrastuzumab (for IHC3+/ISH+/NGS amplification tumors), and \nzanidatamab -hrii (for IHC3+ tumors) are useful in certain circ umstances \nsubsequent -line systemic therapy options for unresectable or metastatic \nprogressive HER2- positive tumors.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBiliary Tract Cancers  \nMS-32 Testing for HER2 ( ERBB2 ) overexpression/amplification is recommended \nfor patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic \nCCA, or extrahepatic CCA.  \nOther Biomarkers (RET/ROS1, KRAS G12C/Other KRAS, Other \nTumor -Agnostic Markers)  \nIn addition to the genomic alterations described in the previous sections, \nNGS testing may uncover other potentially actionable molecular alterations \nthat could help determine eligibility for ongoing clinical trials in patients with \nadvanced BTCs. While there is insufficient evidence to recommend \nuniversal assessment, alterations for which targeted therapies exist and \nhave been FDA -approved in other tumor types, including KRAS G12C \nmutation,384- 386 MET  amplification,387- 389 ALK,390 RET,391 or ROS1  fusions,392 \namong others,393 have been described with variable but overall rare \nfrequency in biliary tract carcinomas and HCC.394 RET fusions have been \nreported to occur in approximately <1% of patients with BTCs, while KRAS \nG12C mutations have been reported in about 1% of patients.395,396 Limited \ndata currently exist regarding the efficacy of targeted therapy in these \nsituations, due to their rarity.  \nIn the phase I/II ARROW study, pralsetinib, a selective RET inhibitor, \ndemonstrated an ORR of 57% (95% CI, 35% –77%) in patients with RET \nfusion- positive tumors other than non -small cell lung cancer and thyroid \ncancer and who received prior treatment or were ineligible for standard \ntherapies.391 The median OS, median PFS, and median DOR were 14 \nmonths, 7 months, and 12 months, respectively. A response was observed \nin two out of three patients who had CCA. However, RET mutations in CCA \nare rare.397 Pralsetinib is a category 2B useful in certain circumstances \nfirst-line or subsequent -line (for progressive disease) systemic therapy \noption for unresectable or metastatic RET  gene fusion- positive tumors.  \nSelpercatinib, a selective RET kinase inhibitor, was investigated in the phase 1/2 LIBRETTO -001 clinical trial in patients with RET  fusion -positive tumors.\n398 Of 41 patients evaluable for efficacy and with tumors other than \nlung or thyroid, the ORR, as assessed by an independent review \ncommittee, was 43.9% (95% CI, 28.5% –60.3%). An objective response \nwas obtained in the one patient who had CCA. Selpercatinib is  a useful in \ncertain circumstances first -line (category 2B) or subsequent -line (for \nprogressive disease) systemic therapy option for unresectable or \nmetastatic RET gene fusion- positive tumors.  \nTesting for RET  fusions is recommended for patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic CCA, or extrahepatic CCA. A \ncomprehensive NGS panel may identify additional alterations for which \ntargeted therapies exist and have FDA -approved treatment s in other tumor \ntypes.  \nThe phase II KRYSTAL- 1 trial investigated adagrasib, a KRAS inhibitor, in \npatients with unresectable or solid tumors with a KRAS G12C mutation.386 \n35.1% (95% CI, 22.9% –48.9%) of patients had an objective response, with \na median DOR of 5.3 months, a median OS of 14.0 months, and a median \nPFS of 7.4 months. In patients with BTCs, the ORR was 41.7% (50.0% of 8 \npatients with CCA, 33.3% of 3 patients wit h ampullary cancer, and 0% of 1 \npatient with gallbladder cancer), with a median OS of 15.1 months and a median PFS of 6.9 months. Adagrasib is a useful in certain circumstances \nsubsequent -line systemic therapy option for unresectable or metastatic \nprogress ive KRAS G12C mutation- positive tumors.  \nTesting for KRAS G12C mutations is recommended for patients with \nunresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic CCA, or \nextrahepatic CCA.  \nOther Targeted Therapies  \nIn a phase II trial, regorafenib was found to have a disease control rate of \n56% and could thus be useful in patients with disease refractory to \nchemotherapy.197 Another phase II trial reported an ORR of 9.1% and a PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBiliary Tract Cancers  \nMS-33 disease control rate of 64%.399 In the phase II REACHIN trial, patients with \nBTCs were randomized to receive best supportive care along with either \nregorafenib or placebo.400 The median PFS for patients in the regorafenib \narm was 3.0 months compared to 1.5 months for those in the placebo arm. \nThe median OS was 5.3 months for the regorafenib group compared to 5.1 \nmonths for the placebo group. Regorafenib is a category 2B subsequent -\nline systemic therapy option (other recommended regimen) for unresectable or metastatic progressive disease.  \nSummary  \nBTCs are associated with a poor prognosis and patients with BTCs \ncommonly present with advanced disease. In the past few years, several \nadvances have been made in the therapeutic approaches. Complete \nresection of the tumor in well -selected patients is currently the best \navailable potentially curative treatment. Ablation is potentially curative for small intrahepatic CCAs. Consideration of locoregional therapy is included \nas an option for patients with unresectable or metastatic intrahepatic CCA. \nThe combina tion of chemotherapy and chemoradiation, chemoradiation \nalone, and consideration of referral to a transplant center are options for unresectable intrahepatic or extrahepatic CCA. Palliative RT may be used \nin patients with unresectable gallbladder cancer or  extrahepatic CCA. \nSystemic therapy is also an option for patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic BTCs.  \nThe combination of durvalumab/gemcitabine/cisplatin, \npembrolizumab/gemcitabine/cisplatin, as well as the combination of \ngemcitabine/cisplatin, are included as category 1 first -line systemic therapy \nrecommendations for patients with unresectable or metastat ic BTCs. Drugs \nsuch as entrectinib, larotrectinib, repotrectinib, pembrolizumab, \ndostarlimab -gxly, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, dabrafenib plus trametinib, \nfutibatinib, pemigatinib, erdafitinib, ivosidenib, fam -trastuzumab \nderuxtecan -nxki, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, tucatinib plus trastuzumab, zanidatamab -hrii, pralsetinib, selpercatinib, and adagrasib, may benefit \ncertain patients with advanced disease harboring specific genomic mutations.  \nA multidisciplinary team consultation is recommended for the assessment of resectability for patients with gallbladder cancer presenting with jaundice \nand for intrahepatic and extrahepatic CCAs. Careful patient selection for \ntreatment and patient engagement are essential. Patient participation in \nprospective clinical trials is encouraged for the treatment of patients with all \nstages of disease.  \n \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:21:37 PM.
