Staining with CK20 (membranous and/or paranuclear dot-like) and negativity for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-\n1) are usually sufficient. If an atypical staining pattern is present, AE1/3 keratin (dot-like), or at least one neuroendocrine marker (such as \nsynaptophysin, neurofilament, INSM1 [insulinoma-associated protein 1],1 chromogranin, CD56, or neuron-specific enolase [NSE]), and/or \nMerkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) T antigen (CM2B4) stains may be used.\n• SLNB evaluation for metastatic MCC requires microscopic evaluation of the entire SLN(s). Before determining SLNB negativity, multiple \nlevels (recommend at least 2) including H&E  and at least one immunohistochemistry stain should be used to help evaluate for metastatic \ndisease . SLNB reporting should also include the number of LN(s) involved, size of largest metastatic deposit (mm), and the presence/\nabsence of ENE.PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGY\n1 Lilo MT, Chen Y, LeBlanc RE.

If SLNB is not performed concurrently, it is recommended that SLNB is performed prior to definitive excision.\nReconstruction:\n• It is recommended that any reconstruction involving extensive undermining or tissue movement be delayed until negative histologic margins \nare verified and SLNB is performed if indicated.\n• Since RT is often indicated postoperatively, closure should be chosen to allow for expeditious initiation of RT (eg, primary closure, avoiding \nextensive tissue movement).\na SLNB is an important staging tool. This procedure and subsequent treatment impact regional control for patients with positive SLNs, but the impact of SLNB on overall \nsurvival is unclear.\nb When Mohs is being performed and the preoperative biopsy is considered insufficient for providing all the staging information required to properly treat the tumor, \nsubmission of the central specimen for vertical paraffin-embedded permanent sections or documentation of staging parameters in Mohs report is recommended.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:23 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMerkel Cell Carcinoma  \n \nMS-2 Overview \nMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare cutaneous neuroendocrine \nneoplasia with approximately 2488 individuals affected per year in the \nUnited States .1 Despite this, MCC is one of the most aggressive skin \ncancers, and its incidence is dramatically increasing.1-4 As MCC tumors \nare frequently misdiagnosed,5-7 the increased  incidence may be due to the \ndiscovery of biomarkers that improve detection of the disease.8,9 Changes \nin environmental risk factors, an aging population, as well as improved \nrecognition and diagnosis of MCC lead to an increase in disease \nincidence.4 \nMCC can grow rapidly and metastasize early, with 63% of primary lesions \nhaving grown rapidly in the 3 months prior to diagnosis .5 Large meta -\nanalyses have shown that at least half of patients with MCC develop \nlymph node metastases and nearly one third develop distant metastases.  \n10-17 Several  studies document the development of locoregional recurrence \nin up to half  of all instances  of MCC.6,16- 21 MCC has a high mortality rate \nexceeding melanoma. The 5- year relative or MCC -specific survival rates  \nrange from 41% to 77% , depending  on stage at presentation.2,6,12,15,20- 24  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update \nMethodology  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines \n(NCCN Guidelines®) for Merkel Cell Carcinoma , an electronic search of \nthe PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature  using the \nsearch term: M erkel  cell carcinoma . The PubMed database was chosen \nbecause it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature \nand indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.25  The search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase 2; Clinical Trial, Phase 3; Clinical Trial, Phase 4; \nGuideline; Meta -Analysis; Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled \nTrial; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  The data from key \nPubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as \nrelevant to these guidelines as  discussed by the Panel during the \nGuidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion \nsection.  Recommendations for which high -level evidence is lacking are \nbased on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.26 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  NCCN \nGuidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMerkel Cell Carcinoma  \n \nMS-3 Risk Factors for MCC  \nSun exposure is believed to be a major risk factor for MCC, based on \nincreased incidence in geographic areas with higher UV (ultraviolet) \nindices , the tendency to occur on skin areas that are exposed to the sun , \nand the frequency of MCCs comingled or adjacent to other skin lesions caused by UV exposure.\n7,27- 32 MCC incidence increases with age and is \nmore likely to occur in white individuals  compared with people from other \nethnicities.4-6,10,15 MCC is disproportionally more common in \nimmunosuppressed individuals, such as those with organ transplants, lymphoproliferative malignancies (such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia \n[CLL]), or HIV infections.\n5,33- 39 Several studies have reported that MCC -\nspecific survival is worse for those with immunosuppression,6,38,40- 47 \nalthough other studies have found no correlation.48-50 Lastly, Merkel cell \npolyomavirus (MCPyV), a polyomavirus in MCC tumor tissues, is detected in 43% to 100% of tumors.\n51-56 MCPyV  negative- tumors  tend to occur more \noften on the head, neck, or trunk , and have been associated with \nincreased recurrence55 and decreased MCC- specific survival and overall \nsurvival (OS)  in some studies57-60 but not  others .61,62 Genetic analyses have \nalso found a much higher mutational burden in MCPyV -negative tumors, \nand that only the MCPyV -negative group are enriched for cytosine to \nthymine (C to T) mutations indicative of UV damage.63-65 \nPreliminary Workup and Diagnosis \nInitial workup of a suspicious lesion starts with a complete history  and \nphysical (H&P)  examination,  and biopsy of the primary tumor. Initial \ndiagnosis of MCC in the primary lesion by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) \nstaining should be confirmed by performing immunohistochemistry (IHC ) \nstaining. An appropriate immunopanel should include cytokeratin 20 \n(CK20 ) and thyroid transcription factor 1 ( TTF-1). Other IHC \nneuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin, neurofilament protein, insulinoma- associated protein 1 (INSM1), chromogranin A , CD56, or  neuron- specific enolase ( NSE) may be used  to exclude other diagnostic \nconsiderations.  \nThe goals of histologic evaluation of primary MCC tumor s are: 1) to \naccurately diagnose and distinguish the tumor from cutaneous simulants and metastatic tumors; 2) to provide complete pathologic tumor \ncharacteristics for staging according to recommended American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC ) and College of American Pathologists \n(CAP) guidelines; and 3) to standardize pathologic data collection to \nfurther understand the critical biologic features that impact MCC behavior \nand prognosis. In accordance with the AJCC, the NCCN Panel agrees that \nsynoptic reporting is preferred. At a minimum, the pathology report should include tumor size, peripheral and deep margin status, lymphovascular \ninvasion ( LVI), and extracutaneous extension to the bone, muscle,  fascia, \nor cartilage, as these features may prove to have prognostic value. The NCCN Panel strongly encourages reporting of the following additional \nprimary tumor features: tumor depth  (Breslow, in mm),  tumor -infiltrating \nlymphocytes ( TILs) (not identified, brisk , or non -brisk) , tumor growth \npattern (nodular or infiltrative), and the presence of a second malignancy \nsuch as concurrent SCC within the pathologic specimen itself.  \nPathology Report  \nThe AJCC strongly encourages synoptic reporting for MCC primary tumor \nspecimens, including but not limited to the parameters needed for \ndetermining T- stage.\n66 The College of American Pathologists (CAP) also \nprovides a complete synoptic report protocol for cutaneous MCC .67   \nPeripheral and Deep Margin Status  \nResults vary between studies analyzing the prognostic value of margin \nstatus, with some studies showing correlations with local control, OS, or \ndisease- specific death (DSD),19,22,23,42,68 but others finding no significant \nassociations with outcome.69-74 The largest study investigating margin PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:23 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMerkel Cell Carcinoma  \n \nMS-4 status in 6901 patients with MCC in the National Cancer Database \n(NCDB ) showed that margin status was significantly associated with \nsurvival for MCC with stage I, stage II, or stage III.68 One study of 179 \npatients  found that margin status was correlated with local recurrence in \nMCC treated with surgery alone, but was far less predictive among \npatients who received adjuvant radiation therapy (RT).22  \nLymphovascular Invasion  \nSeveral  studies with large sample sizes have found LVI to be predictive of \nsentinel lymph node ( SLN) positivity, recurrence, OS, and DSS.23,72,75- 78 A \nlarge (N = 500) review of  a prospective database supported that LVI in the \nprimary tumor was highly correlated with DSD. Specifically, <1% versus \n35% of those who died of MCC were LVI -negative and LVI -positive, \nrespectively.23 \nExtracutaneous Extension  \nThe 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual includes primary \ntumor invasion of fascia, muscle, cartilage, or bone as the definition of stage T4 for MCC.\n14,66 This is supported by results from several \nstudies.12,76,79,80 For example, an analysis of a large database (SEER, N  = \n2104) found that tumor extension beyond the dermis was an independent prognostic factor for DSS.\n79 Another analysis of approximately 5000 \npatients with MCC from the NCDB found that tumor diameter was \nreasonably predictive of relative survival among patients with small \nprimary tumors, but resulted in poor separation among patients with larger \nprimary tumors (>2 cm).12  \nTumor Size and Tumor Thickness \nIn addition to the analyses of NCDB  data that support T- staging criteria for \nthe AJCC staging guidelines,12,14 many studies have analyzed the \nrelationship between  tumor thickness  and various outcomes —including \nlymph node involvement, ability of treatment to achieve local control, \nprobability of distant metastasis, disease- specific survival (DSS), and OS. Results from small er studies ( N < 400) are variable6,19,20,41,42,48,81 but \nanalyses of large databases  have all found primary tumor size to be \nsignificantly associated with nodal involvement, DSS, and OS.13,15,49,68,79,82 It \nis important to note that even in these studies, the risk of microscopic \nlymph node involvement is non- negligible even among patients in the \nsmallest tumor size category .15,49,77,82,83 \nMultiple  institutions have published studies showing correlation between \ntumor thickness or Breslow depth and SLN positivity, disease- free survival \n(DFS), DSS, and OS.49,76,83- 85 The statistical significance of these \ncorrelations varies, perhaps because primary tumor thickness may be \ncorrelated with primary tumor size.49 Per the AJCC staging guidelines, \ntumor thickness should be measured as for Breslow thickness in \ncutaneous melanoma —as the microscopic distance from the granular \nlayer of the overlying epidermis to the deepest point of tumor invasion—and recorded in mm.\n66,67  \nTumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes  \nSeveral  studies have found that the presence of TILs in MCC tumors was \nassociated with improved survival outcomes.76,85- 91 Notably, a retrospective \ncohort study (N = 2182) established that subdivision of TIL status into non -\nbrisk and brisk was associated with incrementally improved OS compared with no TILs.\n86 The prognostic value of TILs seems to depend on the type \nof immune cells present; however, it is not clear which type of TILs has  \nprognostic value.88-90 The CAP protocol for MCC defines TILs as \nlymphocytes present at the interface of the tumor and stroma, without \nspecifying any molecular markers.67 The categories for TILs are based on \nthe presence and distribution of lymphocytes in the tumor sample. TILs \n“not identified” includes samples in which lymphocytes are present but do \nnot infiltrate the tumor. “Nonbrisk” should  be used when lymphocyte \ninfiltration is focal or not present across the entire base of the vertical growth phase, and “brisk” should be used when lymphocytes diffusely PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:23 PM.

One small  retrospective study found that patients with the combined tumors were more likely to have had prior  non-melanoma skin cancers  (NMSCs ), \nnonhematologic extracutaneous cancers, and immunosuppression/pro -\ninflammatory comorbidities, and tend to have more metastasis, disease \nprogression , and death from disease.\n7  \nAdditional Workup \nFor patients with biopsy -confirmed MCC, additional workup may include \ncomplete skin and lymph node examination,  imaging studies , and \nlaboratory studies  as clinically indicated  including MCPyV and MCC \ncirculating tumor ( ctDNA ) testing. Multidisciplinary consultation is \nrecommended  at a center with specialized expertise. As \nimmunosuppression in MCC is a risk factor for poor outcomes ,6,38,40- 46,49,114 \nimmunosuppressive treatments should be minimized as clinically feasible \nin consultation with the relevant treating  physician. The risk for disease \nrecurrence is higher in patients with immunosuppression43,46,47,114,115; \ntherefore,  more frequent follow -up may be indicated.  Additionally  in \npatients <50 years diagnosed with MCC , a genetics consultation should \nbe considered to evaluate for heritable mutations in cancer -associated \ngenes as they have been reported in about 20% of patients in this age \ngroup.116  \nLaboratory Testing  \nSeveral groups have explored the significance of antibodies to MCPyV in \npatients with MCC.56,117- 119 In one prospective validation study that included \n219 patients with newly diagnosed MCC, patients who were oncoprotein \nantibody seronegative at diagnosis had a significantly higher risk of \nrecurrence, suggesting that they may benefit from more intensive surveillance.\n55 For patients  who were seropositive , the oncoprotein \nantibody test every 3 months may be a useful component of ongoing \nsurveillance because a rising titer can be an early indicator of recurrence.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMerkel Cell Carcinoma  \n \nMS-6 In MCC, circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) is a promising minimally invasive \ntool for early stage multi -cancer screening and tumor development \nmonitoring via detection of cell -free DNA fragments.120 Disease burden in \nboth virus -positive and virus -negative MCC can be evaluated by ctDNA \ntesting and surveillance is commonly obtained every 3 months.121 The \nctDNA results typically become  positive prior to or at the time of a clinically \nevident recurrence.122 The use of ctDNA in MCC has shown high disease \nsensitivity and prognostic accuracy  for early detection of MCC recurrence.  \nImaging  Studies   \nThe utility of imaging as part of baseline staging for MCC is an issue of \ndebate in the literature. A number of retrospective analyses have reported \ndata on detection and appearance of MCC tumors using various imaging \nmethods, including conventional x -ray,102,123,124 CT,102,124- 128 \nultrasound,102,124,127 MRI,123,124,127,129 scintigraphy,130-132 and PET or \nPET/CT.127,129,133- 146 For CT and FDG -PET or FDG -PET/CT, there are \nreports showing detection of MCC primary tumors, lymph node \nmetastases, and distant metastases in a wide range of anatomic locations. \nThough the reported sensitivity and specificity of MRI were lower than CT \nand FDG PET/CT,129 it is still the best imaging tool available for rare cases \nof MCC brain metastases.147-149 A number of studies have attempted to \ndetermine the utility of specific imaging methodologies for detecting MCC \ntumors, either in terms of the sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative \npredictive value, or in terms of making an impact on disease res taging or \nmanagement. However, many studies are limited by small sample size (N <30) and did not consistently use pathologic confirmation as a standard of \nreference for determining positive and negative predictive values.  \nImaging is encouraged for staging of most MCC because occult metastatic \ndisease that resulted in upstaging has been detected in 12% to 20% of \npatients presenting without suspicious H&P findings.\n150 This study by \nSingh et  al indicate s that whole- body PET with fused axial imaging is more sensitive for detecting occult metastatic disease at baseline.150 Acceptable \nalternative imaging modalities include brain MRI with or without contrast if clinical suspicion of brain metastasis, chest/abdomen/pelvis CT with \ncontrast with neck CT for primary tumor on the head/neck, or whole- body \nFDG -PET/CT, which might be indicated to evaluate for in- transit \nmetastasis for a primary tumor on an extremity. CT or MRI with contrast \nmay be used if whole- body FDG -PET/CT is not available. The use of brain \nMRI varies among NCCN Panel m embers . Some P anel members reserve \nthis test for patients that have an indication of brain metastases or in which \nwidespread systemic disease has been detected.\n151 Imaging may also be \nuseful to evaluate for the possibility of a skin metastasis from a \nnoncutaneous primary neuroendocrine carcinoma (eg, small cell lung \ncancer [SCLC]), especially in cases where CK20 is negative and/or TTF -1 \nis positive. It must be noted that the most reliable staging tool to identify \nsubclinical nodal disease is sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).   \nComputed Tomography  \nOnly a few studies have evaluated the independent utility of CT for \ndetection of MCC tumors.102,124- 129 According to Gupta et al , the calculated \nsensitivity and specificity of baseline CT imaging for detection of lymph \nnode metastases w ere 20% and 87%, respectively. Conversely, for the \ndetection of distant metastases, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% \nand 48%, respectively. For both nodal and distant spread of MCC, true \npositives oftentimes had disease that were clinically evident at \npresentation.126 A separate study  came to similar conclusions, reporting \nthat the low sensitivity and high specificity of CT scans  were 47% and \n97%, respectively, in detecting nodal disease. In this study , CT imaging \nwas unable to detect micrometastases  as well as  larger lymph node \nmetastases, including single node positivity in six  patients and multiple \npositive nodes in five  patients.129  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:23 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMerkel Cell Carcinoma  \n \nMS-7 FDG -PET/CT  \nCompared with CT imaging, there are many more studies  with larger \nsample sizes  on the utility of FDG -PET/CT for detecting MCC \ntumors .127,129,133- 146 Overall, FDG -PET/CT has high sensitivity and specificity  \nwhen compared with subsequent pathologic , clinical, or imaging results, \nwith calculated values of 90% and 98%, respectively, according to a meta-\nanalysis.139 In the only prospective study to date, FDG -PET/CT had a \nsensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 88%, respectively.146 Small \nretrospective studies indicate that FDG -PET/CT might not be useful in \ndetecting lymph node metastasis (compared with SLNB),143 as well as \nprimary tumor site in patients with unknown primary MCC.144 A number of \nstudies  reported that results from FDG -PET/CT scans at initial \npresentation impacted baseline staging in 6% to 39% of patients and changed treatment in 6% to 37% of patients.\n134-138,140- 142,145,146 Most of the \nchanges in staging  and disease management were due to discovery of \nmore extensive lymph node involvement , distant metastatic disease,  or \npreviously undetected secondary cancers,  suggesting that FDG -PET \nimaging may be more useful in patients with  clinically  advanced disease at \npresentation.  \nSome evidence suggests that FDG -PET/CT may be more useful than CT \nin detecting nodal and distant MCC. In a retrospective analysis , in which \nCT and FDG -PET results were compared to SLNB results, the calculated \nsensitivity of FDG -PET was notably better than that for CT (83% vs. \n47%).129 Furthermore, in some studies, FDG -PET/CT detected positive \nlymph nodes and distant metastases that were not detectable by CT \nscans .136,137,146 In a large retrospective study, patients who underwent \nPET/CT had disease upstaged more often than those with CT alone \n(16.8% vs. 6.9%; P  = .0006).150 Characteristics and Differential Diagnosis  \nMCC is rarely clinically suspected  at presentation  because the primary \ntumor lacks distinguishing features and is often asymptomatic. In a  study \nof 195 patients with pathologically confirmed MCC, 88% of MCC tumors \nwere asymptomatic and correct clinical diagnosis was rare (only 1%).5 \nBased on clinical impression, 56% of MCC tumors were initially presumed \nto be benign cysts/lesions.5 Other studies confirm that MCCs are \nfrequently clinically  misdiagnosed as benign lesions or NMSCs  or other \nrare malignant skin tumors.6,7,152 Misdiagnosis is even more prevalent \namong MCC tumors that are admixed or adjacent to other skin tumors.7,153 \nMCC tumors visualized by H&E typically contain small round cells with \nsparse cytoplasm, abundant mitoses, and dense core granules in the \ncytoplasm.61,93,95,123,154 MCC is similar to a variety of other widely recognized \nsmall round cell tumors, including metastatic visceral neuroendocrine \ncarcinomas (eg, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, metastatic \ncarcinoid, SCLC, lymphomas, osteosarcoma).155-160 The most difficult \ndifferentiation is often between primary MCC and metastatic  SCLC.  \nIHC has proved useful for distinguishing MCC from other small round cell \ntumors. In one early study, MCC was correctly diagnosed by light \nmicroscopy in 60%  of patients , but IHC or electron microscopy was \nneeded to diagnose the remaining patients .102 CK20 and TTF -1 often \nprovide the greatest sensitivity and specificity to exclude SCLC. CK20 is \npositive in 75% to 100% of primary  MCC tumors and rarely positive in \nSCLC. TTF- 1 is never positive in MCC, but is often positive in SCLC \n(>80%) and other primary pulmonary tumors.8,9,93,159,161- 164 Neuroendocrine \nmarkers such as INSM1 , chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56, NSE, and \nneurofilament are found in most MCC tumors.30,75,80,93,95,159,160,165- 172 The \nNCCN Panel recommends that these markers be considered for additional \nimmunostaining.

The current AJCC staging system (8th edition) is based on an \nupdated analysis of 9387 patients with MCC from the NCDB with a median \nfollow- up of 28.2 months.14 The NCCN staging of MCC largely parallels \nthe AJCC guidelines and divides presentation into surgically resectable \nlocal,  locally advanced (curative surgery and RT not feasible),  regional /in-\ntransit,  and disseminated disease.66 Clinical exam , imaging, laboratory \nstudies, a multidisciplinary consultation, immunosuppression assessment, \nand potentially a genetics consultation are used to make an initial \ndetermination of the clinical N -stage and M -stage . Clinical staging \ndetermines the recommended approach for evaluating pathologic nodal \nstatus. There is evidence that among patients with clinically apparent \nnodal disease at presentation, those with unknown primary have a better \noutcome than those with synchronous known primary,14,41,174- 177 and these \nfindings are reflected in the AJCC staging system .66 However, the NCCN \nrecommendations for pathologic evaluation of nodal status and \nmanagement of the nodal basin are the same for both groups of patients.  \nSurgery for Primary Tumor  \nGiven the potential for rapid growth, surgery has been the most common approach used to treat primary MCC tumors  and has been shown to \nproduce superior outcomes compared to nonsurgical  primary \ntreatment.\n42,178 Outcomes for a variety of surgical approaches to remov e \nMCC primary tumors have been reported in the literature, including biopsy \napproaches, either with or without subsequent re -excision to obtain clear  \nmargins, standard excision, local amputation, and Mohs  or other approaches with integrated complete margin assessment.6,22,42,48,179- 189 \nWhereas there are a number of retrospective studies that found that \nnegative margin stat us was associated with improved local recurrence and \nsurvival,22,23,42,68,183,185,190- 192 other analyses did not consistently find such \nassociations .19,71- 74,136,193- 197 There is evidence that margin status has an \nimpact on survival regardless of adjuvant RT receipt.192 Among case s with \nstage I/II disease treated with surgery only, recurrence rates and OS were \nbetter for negative versus positive margins.185 On the other hand, for high-\nrisk local and regional MCC, margin status did not seem to have an impact \non recurrence in those who received adjuvant RT.198,199  \nMohs is a useful technique for margin control in MCC and has been associated with improved outcomes  compared with standard excision for \nprimary MCC lesions.\n183,184,186 In many studies , Mohs and wide local \nexcision ( WLE ) resulted in similar rates of recurrence and \nsurvival.6,180,184,185,188 There is much debate about the size of surgical \nexcision margins needed to achieve histologically clear margins. Among  \npatients treated with M ohs, the mean margin needed to achieve histologic \nclearance was 16.7 mm, and 2- cm and 3- cm surgical margins would have \nresult ed in incomplete histologic clearance in 25% and 12% of patients, \nrespectively.187 Among those treated with WLE , 2-cm and 3- cm clinical \nmargins resulted in incomplete excision in 50% and 0% of patients, respectively.\n200 For patients with histologically clear margins, retrospective \ndata suggest  a trend toward reduced risk of recurrence for patients with \nhistologic margins > 1 cm versus <1 cm .22,181,201 However, those who \nreceived adjuvant RT and had margins < 1 cm had similar OS to those who \ndid not receive adjuvant RT and had margins > 1 cm.201 There are data \nsupporting excision margins > 2 cm as being significantly associated with \nhigher OS,201,202 while some studies contend that increasing histologic \nmargin size beyond 1 cm is not associated with additional clinical \nbenefit.69,179,181  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:23 PM.

PDEMA, or complete margin assessment, is a term used for a subset of surgical techniques for high- quality histologic visualization \nand interpretation of the margin surface or surgically excised tissue. Mohs micrographic surgery i s the most common utilized PDEMA technique. \nPDEMA is a team procedure that requires the participation of physicians from multiple d isciplines while Mohs physicians serve as both surgeon and \npathologist requiring highly specialized training. Efforts have been \nextended to generate consensus recommendations to offer Mohs \nsurgeons guidance and promote standardization to make data aggregate \nfrom multicenter clinical trials.\n203  \nSentinel Lymph Node Biopsy  \nSLNB is an important staging tool for identifying subclinical nodal \nmetastases, which is valuable for accurate staging in addition to impacting  \nsubsequent treatment decisions.6,50,83 Given  the benefits of performing \nSLNB , every effort should be made to perform  sentinel lymph node biopsy \nprior to or at the time of primary tumor excision. This is particularly \nimportant in the cases of head and neck MCC given the concern that \nresection and reconstruction prior to performing a SLNB may impact the \naccuracy of subsequent nodal basin mapping.199 \nLarge retrospective analyses ( N >100) or meta -analyses of SLNB in \npatients with clinically node- negative,  localized MCC have reported rates \nof SLN positivity ranging from 30% to 40%.6,46,49,94,126,204,205 As discussed in \nthe elements of pathology report, there are a number of primary tumor \ncharacteristics that have been proposed to be predictive of SLN positivity, \nincluding primary tumor diameter, thickness, LVI, and TILs.49,77,83,91,206 \nSome studies showed significant association between SLN negativity and \nlower risk of recurrence and improved DSS or OS ,46,49,50,78,126,206- 209 while  \nothers  did not.77,205,210 Reported rates of regional relapse in patients with negative SLNB results range from 5% to 12%, with corresponding false-\nnegative rates between 17% and 21%.46,50,204 Some studies have reported \ncomplicated drainage patterns for MCCs occurring in the head and \nneck .211-213 Besides, multiple SLNs have been identified in some patients , \nsuggesting that the inability to identify all relevant SLNs may contribute to \nthe relatively high rates of false- negative SLNBs.46,50,204  \nAnother  issue of debate is whether the SLNB procedure itself offers some \nprotection against recurrence, progression, or death from disease  for \npatients with clinically node- negative disease . One retrospective study of \npatients  with clinical stage I/II MCC found that those who underwent SLNB \nhad improved 5 -year DSS compared with those who did not undergo \nSLNB, although the actual difference was small (79% vs. 74%).208 Another \nanalysis of a large population database found that compared with patients who had no pathologic nodal evaluation, those with SLNB alone or SLNB \nplus lymph node dissection (LND)  had lower risk of all -cause mortality, \nand that SLNB plus LND was also associated with improved MCC -specific \nmortality.\n41 There is insufficient information to ascertain whether these \nassociations are due to the SLNB procedure itself or due to subsequent  \ndisease management choices informed by the results of pathologic nodal \nevaluation. Other r etrospective studies have found that among patients \npresenting with clinically node- negative MCC, SLNB is not significantly \nassociated with improved LRC or OS,6,42 except for one report of  \nsignificantly longer OS.181 \nSLNB Pathology  \nIHC analysis has been shown to be effective in detecting MCC lymph \nnode metastases not detected by H&E.137,214- 216 IHC with CK20 has been \nincluded as part of routine screening  in multiple studies .50,143,181,214,217 Other \nIHC stains for histologic analysis of SLNs  have also been reported such as  \npancytokeratins (AE1/AE3, CAM5.2), or antibodies sometimes used for PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:23 PM.

IHC analyses of FNA samples showed that most MCCs \nwere positive for CK20, AE1/AE3, synaptophysin , NSE, and CD56.218,220,221 \nChromogranin staining was present in a smaller proportion of patient \nsamples (36%).220,221 Markers for melanoma ( ie, S100, HMB45, Melan A, \nCD45) or lymphoma (leukocyte common antigen)  were nearly always \nnegative.218,220,221 \nDefinitive Radiation Therapy for Locoregional Disease  \nHistorically,  surgery has been the mainstay of treatment for local and \nregional MCC ; as a result, data on the efficacy of definitive RT are  \nextremely limited. There are a large number of retrospective studies that \ninclude very small samples of patients ( N < 10) who received definitive RT \ninstead of surgery.19,23,42,71,152,174,194,195,197,222- 230 Patients whose disease \nreceived nonsurgical  initial treatment , most often definite RT or RT in \nconjunction with chemotherapy, tended to have poorer outcomes than \nthose initially treated with surgery .42,178 The largest study (N > 2000)  \ncomparing outcomes between definitive RT and surgery  showed improved \nOS with surgery ( ± adjuvant RT) versus definitive RT, both among patients \nwith stage I/II  disease (median OS, 76 vs. 25 months; P < .001) and \namong those with stage III disease (median OS, 30 vs. 15 months; P < .001).178 However, t he patient population  where MCC was  treated with \nsurgery was more likely to have factors associated with improved \noutcomes  such as smaller primary tumor size , tumor in the upper \nextremity, shorter time to diagnosis, treatment at an academic hospital, and no chemotherapy.  \nFor those with local or locoregional MCC who are poor surgical candidates \nor refuse surgery, however, initial treatment that includes definitive RT \nlikely provides good outcomes. One study using SEER data found that \namong patients who did not receive surgery (N = 746), those who received \nRT had better OS and DSS than those who did not (DSS at 5 years , 73% \nvs. 54%; P < .0001).\n15 Retrospective studies of  MCC  treated with definitive \nRT to their primary and/or nodal MCC reported in- field recurrence rates  of \n<25%, with median time to in- field recurrence ranging from 4 to 6.3 \nmonths.22,231- 236 One meta -analys is of 264 patients with locoregional MCC \ntreated with definitive RT reported that cumulative in- field recurrence rate \nwas 12% per site, and that in- field recurrence was significantly more likely \nat regional versus primary irradiated sites (16% vs. 7.6% ; P = .02).229 The \nNCCN Panel generally recommends that RT be initiated as soon as \nwound healing permits as delays have been associated with poorer \noutcomes.237,238    \nClinical N0: Local MCC Only , Surgically Resectable \nThe disease management plan for primary MCC tumors that are surgically \nresectable is dictated by the state of the surgical margins and the \npresence of adverse risk factors, which include larger primary tumor size \n(>1 cm), chronic T- cell immunosuppression, HIV, CLL, solid organ \ntransplant, head/neck primary site, and LVI6,23,38,40- 47,49,72,75- 78,114,239 These are \nrisk factors of particular concern because they are highly associated with \npoor outcomes . Mohs micrographic surgery (Mohs) and PDEMA are \nmethods for surgical excision of the primary tumor, using margins similar to WLE ( See NCCN Guidelines for Squamous Cell Skin Cancer –  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:23 PM.

These \nalternative methods ensure complete tumor removal and clear margins, \nwhile sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Regardless of the surgical \ntechnique used , the goal should be primary tissue closure to avoid any \nundue delay in proceeding with  RT and allow for initiation of adjuvant \nRT.238 \nPrimary treatment for  patient s that are deemed surgically resectable \ninclude excision with 1 to 2 cm margins,238 or in certain circumstances \nMohs or others forms of PDEMA, as well as  SLNB with an appropriate \nimmunopanel.  Because of the high historic risk of local recurrence in \nMCC, there is emphasis on a complete extirpation of tumor at the time of \ninitial resection to achieve histologically clear surgical margins when clinically feasible.\n68,199,240 If clear margins are achieved,  observation is \nrecommended  if there are no adverse risk factors; however, if one or more \nadverse risk factors are detected , adjuvant radiation therapy is \nrecommended as an additional treatment .238 In the case of microscopically \npositive margins , adjuvant RT is preferred along with or over re -excision . \nAdjuvant R T is also a treatment option for individuals with narrow \npostsurgical  clinical margins of <1 cm or with adverse risk factors. \nAdditionally, t he recommended surgical margin may vary based upon \nrecommendations for adjuvant radiation therapy. To minimize morbidity, \nnarrow excision margins resulting in possible microscopically positive \nmargins are acceptable when followed by adjuvant RT to the pr imary \nsite.238 Surgical margins should be balanced with morbidity of surgery . \nIn addition to surgical resection, primary treatment also includes SLNB with an appropriate immunopanel. The preferred additional treatment for \npatients with negative SLN is continued observation of the nodal basin. RT \nto the nodal basin may be considered i n certain high- risk scenarios, such \nas a compromised SLNB result, high probability of false- negative SLN due \nto aberrant lymph node drainage or multiple SLN basins, or profound immunosuppression. Appropriateness of RT should be determined \ntogether with a radiation oncologist. If the SLNB is positive, baseline \nimaging should be performed, if not previously . Imaging may include \nwhole -body FDG -PET/CT or CT with contrast of chest, abdomen, pelvis, \nand neck if the primary  tumor is  on the head/neck . Additionally,  MRI of the \nbrain with and without contrast is recommended if  there is  clinical \nsuspicion of brain metastases or direct extension.  Following imaging, \nadditional treatment requires a multidisciplinary consultation at a center \nwith specialized expertise to consider subsequent treatment via RT to the \nnodal basin or node dissection. If node dissection is performed, the patient \ncan be obs erved for disease progression or subsequent adjuvant RT can \nbe applied for multiple involved nodes and/or the presence of extr anodal \nextension (ENE).  \nClinical N0: Locally Advanced MCC When Curative Surgery and \nAdjuvant RT Are not Feasible  \nA multidisciplinary consultation at a specialized center is recommended for \nlocally advanced Merkel cell carcinoma ( laMCC)  patients for whom \ncurative surgery and curative RT is not feasible prior to deciding on a \nprimary treatment path. After a multidisciplinary discussion , the favored  \ntreatment option include s neoadjuvant immunotherapy with an anti -PD-1 \nagent  (see Systemic Therapy for Merkel Cell Carcinoma)  for patients who \nare surgical candidates . If a treatment response is seen and the tumor is \namenable to resection, either WLE  or more rarely Mohs or other forms of \nPDEMA can be pursued with consideration for SLNB . After resection, the \ntumor can be further treated following the resectable local MCC path \nprimary and additional treatment options. P atients that are  considered \nnonsurgical candidates due to comorbidities,  tumor  characteristics, or \nprogression  on neoadjuvant  nivolumab, will require a discussion regarding \nthe advantages and disadvantages of treatment with RT for durable local \ncontrol versus  systemic therapy .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMerkel Cell Carcinoma  \n \nMS-12 Nodal Staging and Treatment of Regional Disease \nManagement of the Primary Tumor for Regional Disease  \nSLNB is recommended for all patients with  clinically node -negative \ndisease who are fit for surgery. The NCCN Panel believes that by \nidentifying patients with positive microscopic nodal disease and then \nperforming full  LNDs and/or RT, the care of regional disease in this patient \npopulation is maximized. SLNB should be performed prior to surgical \nremoval of the primary  tumor , with special care taken in the head and neck \nregion where drainage patterns are often complex and can lead to unreliable SLNB results (risk of false negative results\n241). The primary \ntumor  can be treated as clinical N0  and follow the resectable local MCC or \nlaMCC pathways including SLNB  after initial recommended imaging \nstudies to evaluate the extent of lymph node and/or visceral organ \ninvolvement.  Subsequently, there are separate recommendations for the \nmanagement of the draining nodal basin and in- transit disease; however, \nthese treatment options can both be considered for appropriate patients.  \nManagement of the Draining Nodal Basin  \nA clinical N+ diagnosis (palpable lymph nodes) should be confirmed by \nusing FNA or core biopsy of the draining nodal basin with an appropriate \nimmunopanel. An excisional  biopsy may be considered to confirm a \nnegative initial FNA or core lymph node biopsy if clinical suspicion remains \nhigh. Alternatively, patients with negative results can also continue \nradiographic surveillance. If initial or subsequent lymph node biopsy \nresults are positive and distant metastasis is detected, disease \nmanagement should follow the M1 pathway. In case of no detected distant metastases, multidisciplinary consultation,  node dissection and RT  \n(preferred), node dissection or RT, clinical trial, and consideration for systemic therapy  are recommended  treatment options . The node \ndissection and RT treatment option is preferred and enrollment in a clinical \ntrial for adjuvant therapy is preferred, if available.  IHC analysis should be included in the SLNB evaluation in addition to H&E \nsections to reduce the risk of false negative  results . CK20 immunostaining \nshould be included in the pathologic assessment to facilitate accurate identification of micrometastases.\n An appropriate immunopanel may also \ninclude pancytokeratins (AE1/AE3), depending on the immunostaining \npattern of the primary tumor. Some NCCN Member Institutions routinely \nuse both CK20 and pancytokeratin stains to evaluate SLN samples to \nensure detection  of MCC metastases , because results from these two  \nmarkers are not always consistent. The pathology report should also \ninclude the number of lymph nodes involved,  size of largest metastatic \ndeposit (mm),  and the presence or absence of ENE .  \nEmpiric RT to the nodal basin can be considered in patients with certain \nhigh- risk clinical scenarios : 1) the accuracy or reliability of SLNB may have \nbeen compromised  (eg, prior surgery, extensive CLL within the nodes, \nhistory of prior LN excision); 2) the risk of false -negative SLNB is high due \nto aberrant lymph node drainage and presence of multiple SLN basins \n(such as in head and neck or midline trunk MCC); or 3) patients present  \nwith profound immunosuppression (ie, solid organ transplant recipients).  \nPatients with positive SLNB results should receive baseline imaging, if not \nalready performed, to screen for and quantify regional and distant \nmetastases. If the tumor burden in the sentinel node is low, the risk of \ndistant disease may also be low. However, it is important to confirm staging, and baseline scans are useful for comparison in the event of a \nsuspected recurrence.  \nAdjuvant systemic therapy  should be considered for certain patients with \nregional disease as part of a multidisciplinary consultation. For patients  \nwith primary or recurrent regional MCC where curative surgery and \ncurative RT is not feasible adjuvant systemic therapy  similar to the options \navailable to individuals with disseminated disease  is considered, treatment \nin the context of a clinical trial is preferred, when available.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMerkel Cell Carcinoma  \n \nMS-13 Management of  In-transit Disease  \nThe AJCC eighth edition staging system defines MCC in- transit lesions as \ndiscontinuous from primary tumor, located between the primary tumor and \nthe draining regional nodal basin or distal to the primary tumor site.14,66 The \nin-transit disease pathway  delineates alternative treatment options when \ncompared to regionally nodal positive MCC. For  management of in- transit \ndisease, diagnosis confirmation with biopsy is recommended. Following \nconfirmation, treatment options for in -transit disease include \nmultidisciplinary consultation, clinical trials, surgery, radiation treatment, as well as systemi c therapy if curative surgery and/or RT are not feasible. \nWhile the Panel has made these general treatment recommendations for in-transit disease, it is important to note that due to the rarity of this clinical \nscenario and the lack of high quality peer -reviewed primary literature, \nthese recommendations are based on expert opinion.\n242-245 This lack of \nlarge studies has led to individualized treatment decisions with the input of \na multidisciplinary team at a high volume treatment center.  \nSurgery Versus Radiation Therapy for Regional Disease  \nSince  the presence of MCC in the lymph nodes is associated with poorer \nprognosis,14,20,79,183,209,246 the clinical instinct is to aggressively treat the \nnodal basin in patient s with pathologically positive lymph node(s). Indeed, \na retrospective study of 82 patients with locoregional MCC found that \nnodal treatment was associated with improved disease control: LND \nprolonged the time to first recurrence (median of 11.8– 28.5 months; P = \n.034), as did RT to the nodal basin (median of 11.3– 46.2 months; P = \n.01).193 A meta -analysis that included 39 patients with SLN positivity found \nthat those who received some form of post -SLNB treatment for nodal \ndisease (therapeutic LND [TLND], RT, chemotherapy) had improved 3-\nyear relapse- free survival (51% vs. 0%; P < .01).126  Due to lack of prospective data, however, it is unclear whether surgical \napproaches or RT  are more effective as initial treatment for nodal MCC. \nFor studies with at least 20 patients with MCC lymph node involvement, \nfew reported outcomes for specific nodal treatments.22,68,77,174,178,222,227,247,248 \nWright et al showed that surgery (with or without adjuvant RT) was \nassociated with better OS compared with definitive RT (median,  30 vs. 15 \nmonths ; P < .001) .178 In contrast, Bhatia et al  found no significant \ndifference in OS for surgery alone compared with RT alone or surgery plus \nRT.68 Furthermore, while some studies suggest that nodal surgery may \nimprove outcomes,48,247- 249 a few found that patients who received nodal \nRT alone fared better,20,22 and others found no clear trends according to \nnodal treatment .20,77,174,222,227,250 Perez et al  and Lee et al , retrospectively, \nevaluated outcomes for MCC treated with lymph node dissection versus \nRT for sentinel lymph node biopsy positive disease and found low rates of regional recurrence for both treatment modalities, suggesting that both \ntreatment modalities may be effective in appropriate patient cohorts.\n251,252 \nThere are very few data to inform the extent of nodal surgery needed for patients with biopsy -proven regional disease. Results from retrospective \nanalyses suggest that MCC prognosis worsens with increasing nodal \ninvolvement  (clinically detectable nodal involvement versus microscopic \nnodal involvement,\n14,23,49,72 increasing number of nodes \ninvolved,15,19,68,79,82,195,205,225,236,253,254 and the presence of ECE84,205,225). These \nfindings suggest that the aggressiveness of nodal treatment should \nperhaps be commensurate with the extent of nodal disease. The type of \nLN surgery may not be very important if patients are also treated with RT. \nA pooled analysis of several prospect ive studies found that the margin \nstatus of surgically removed lymph nodes was not associated with locoregional recurrence in patients who received RT to the nodal basin.\n255 \nOne of these prospective studies also found that among patients with \nlocoregional MCC, all of whom were treated with surgery plus RT (with or PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:23 PM.

Some studies, on the other hand,  found no significant \ncorrelations with outcomes .6,19,46,72,262- 264 For most of these studies , the \nresults are difficult to interpret because they  included a range of MCC \nstages, a mix of primary and recurrent MCC s , a variety of surgical \nprocedures prior to RT, and a mix of patients who received RT to the \nprimary site only, nodal basin only, or both. For studies that included sub -\ngroup analysis, the sample sizes were usually too small  for meaningful \ninterpretations . \nOverall, studies reporting results specifically for  patients with stage I/II \ndisease agree that adjuvant RT to the primary tumor significantly reduced \nthe rate and time to locoregional recurrence,17,187,260,265- 267 while many  also \nreported improvements in survival.68,184,185,197,259,265 Kang et al examined 42 \npatients with  stage I/II MCC and determined that those who had RT to \ntheir primary site had significantly higher 2- year local recurrence -free \nsurvival compared to those who did not receive RT (89% vs . 36%; P < \n.001).265 Of note, t hree large studies using NCDB data (N > 1000 patients \nwith stage I/II MCC)  concluded that surgery plus RT or  conformal RT  \n(CRT) led to significantly better survival results compared to surgery \nalone.68,184,185 Even though benefit has been noted for low -risk stage I \nMCC,260,266 local MCC with high -risk features  might have the most to gain \nfrom adjuvant RT.22,239,258,263,268 Particularly, a study of 1858 patients with \nstage I/II MCC who met indication for RT according to the NCCN recommendation (positive margin, tumor size ≥1 cm, LVI) concluded that \n5-year OS advantage was identified for those who received RT when \nindicated ( P < .003). On the other hand, no OS advantage was observed \nwhen patients received  guideline- discordant RT ( P = .478).259 \nRegarding the clinical benefit of adjuvant RT for patients with node-\npositive versus node -negative MCC, results vary widely between \nstudies.19,22,46,48,50,68,69,72,73,126,197,239,251,262,269- 271 Some studies showed that \npostoperative RT was associated with improved survival in patients with \nstage I/II disease, but not for stage III disease.68,197 In contrast, a  \nretrospective study found that postoperative RT  to the primary tumor bed \nimproved LRC and DSS in patients with pathologic or clinically positive nodes, but not in patients with negative nodes .\n239 In other studies , nodal \nRT in patients  with positive SLNB  significantly reduced 3-year relapse- free \nsurvival rate (51% vs . 0%; P < .01),126 as well as 3 -year regional control \n(95% vs . 66.7%; P = .008).272 A large study using NCDB data (N  = 447) of \npatients with SLNB -positive MCC reported that compared with completion \nlymph node dissection ( CLND),  observation , or RT alone, CLND and \nadjuvant RT were associated with better OS.271 Several studies pointed \nout that the utility of adjuvant RT might be extended to patients  with \nnegative nodes .22,50,69,73,269,272 Specifically,  tumor -bed irradiation was \nsignificantly associated with prolonged DFS ( P = .006) and OS ( P = .014) \nin patients  with negative SLNB .50 In another study, RT to regional nodes \nwas associated with improved regional control, irrespective of clinical \nstatus ( P = .01).73 Overall, studies have both supported22 and refuted262 the \neffectiveness of nodal RT in reducing nodal relapse in node- negative \npatients.  \nTreatment of Distant Metastatic Disease  \nMany retrospective studies have reported the pattern of MCC metastatic \nspread to distant sites based on large patient databases that include data \nfrom various points in the development of the disease.18,72,101,102,137,273- 275 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:23 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nMerkel Cell Carcinoma  \n \nMS-15 Based on these analyses, distant metastatic MCC is most likely to arise in \ndistant lymph nodes or skin, bone/bone marrow, lung/pleura, or liver , \nfollowed by the pancreas, adrenal glands, brain, kidneys, subcutaneous tissue, or muscle.  \nThe NCCN P anel recommends multidisciplinary consultation for patients \nwith distant metastatic disease (M1)  at a center with specialized expertise. \nComprehensive imaging is recommended for all patients with any clinically \ndetected and pathologically proven regional or distant metastases. In \ngeneral, the treat ment of distant metastases must be individually tailored. \nAlthough the NCCN Panel recognized that MCC is a rare disease that precludes robust randomized studies, enrollment in clinical trials is \nencouraged whenever available and appropriate. Clinical trials testing \ntherapies shown to be effective against other metastatic cancers (eg, \nmelanoma) should be considered. The multidisciplinary Panel may \nconsider treatment with one or more of the following modalities: systemic therapy, RT, and surgery. Systemic therapy and RT will likely be the \nprimary treatment options to consider  (see Systemic Therapy for Merkel \nCell Carcinoma  section) . Surgery may be beneficial in highly selective \ncircumstances for resection of oligometastas es or symptomatic lesions. All \npatients should receive best supportive care, and depending on the extent \nof the disease and other patient -specific circumstances, palliative care \nalone may be the most appropriate option for some patients  (See NCCN \nGuidelines for Palliative Care, available at www.NCCN.org ).   \nSystemic Therapy for Merkel Cell Carcinoma  \nImmunotherapy  \nResults from clinical trials , case, retrospective, and prospective studies  \nsupport the use of avelumab,  ipilimumab,  ipilimumab/nivolumab, \nnivolumab, pembrolizumab,  retifanlimab -dlwr, and talimogene \nlaherparepvec (T -VEC)  for the treatment of certain patients with local, \nregional, or disseminated disease. Although there are no randomized comparative trials comparing  immune checkpoint inhibitor s (ICIs) and \nchemotherapy, ICIs provide response rates similar to those previously \nreported for chemotherapy and may provide greater durability of response.   \nAvelumab  \nTwo retrospective multi -institutional studies  assessed treatment outcomes  \nfor avelumab in MCC .

Grade 3 or 4 TRAEs were observed in 10 (40%) cohort A and \n8 (32%) of cohort B  patients .  \nIpilimumab with or without nivolumab was studied in a nonrandomized, \nopen label, multicenter phase I/II trial for 68 patients  with recurrent or \nmetastatic MCC.288 Patients were treated with nivolumab (N = 25) or \nnivolumab plus ipilimumab (N = 43) with an observed  ORR and median \nDOR of 60% and 60.6 months with nivolumab and 58% and 25.9 months \nwith nivolumab plus ipilimumab , respectively . Additionally, the median PFS \nwas 21.3 months for nivolumab and 8.4 months for the combination regimen. The OS for nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab was  80.7 \nand 29.8 months, respectively. The TRAE incidence was higher for the \ncombination than the monotherapy (47% vs . 28%).  \nNivolumab  \nNivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting was studied in the Checkmate 358 \nphase I/II trial that included 39 patients with resectable MCC  stage IIA –IV \nwho had received ≥1 doses of nivolumab.289 Among 36 patients who \nunderwent surgery, 47.2% (N = 17) achieved a pathologic complete \nresponse (pCR).

In several \nstudies the response rate appeared to depend on the number of prior \nchemotherapy regimens, with reports of response rates up to 70% for first -\nline chemotherapy, and as low as 9% to 20% in patients who received one or more prior lines of chemotherapy.\n231,273,301- 307 Reported responses to \nchemotherapy were fairly short -lived, with a median duration ranging from \napproximately 2 to 9 months.231,273,302- 306 Reported rates of toxic death were \nbetween 3% and 10%, with patients  who are older  being at higher \nrisk.231,273,302 \nHigh-quality clinical data on adjuvant systemic therapy options are lacking \nsince very few patients receive chemotherapy for MCC . For most of the \nstudies in which some subset s of patients received postoperative \nchemotherapy, often in combination with adjuvant RT, use of \nchemotherapy was not associated with reduced risk of recurrence or \ndistant metastasis , or improved survival.41,68,73,183,256,263,302,308,309 Two studies  \nfound that adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with worse  survival.19,309 \nSeveral studies found that postoperative chemoradiation did not improve \noutcomes compared with postoperative RT.48,183,263 Particularly, results \nfrom a prospective trial of chemoradiation (carboplatin plus etoposide) in \n40 patients with stage I –III disease compared with historical controls ( N = \n62) treated with postoperative RT did not support the use of adjuvant \nchemotherapy .256 A large NCDB study (N = 4 815) found that, relative to \nsurgery alone, postoperative chemoradiation improved OS but postoperative chemotherapy (without RT ) had the opposite effect.\n183 There \nwas a nonsignificant trend toward improved OS with postoperative \nchemoradiation compared with postoperative RT alone ( P = .08). \nHowever, this difference was only significant in patients with  positive \nmargins ( P = .03) and primary tumor size ≥ 3 cm ( P = .02).183 These results \nsuggest that although postoperative chemotherapy alone is unlikely to \nimprove outcomes, postoperative chemoradiation may have a role in particularly high- risk MCC s in which residual disease is present after \nsurgery.  \nThe most common systemic therapy regimen used for adjuvant treatment of regional disease is cisplatin or carboplatin with or without \netoposide\n19,48,223,256,263,309; however, information about the agents used was \nnot available from the NCDB analysis  that showed that postoperative \nchemotherapy may provide clinical benefit in certain patients  with high- risk \ndisease.183  \nAlternative Therapies  \nHyperthermic Isolated Limb Infusion /Perfusion  \nWhile established as a regional therapy in melanoma, hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion ( HILP) as a MCC treatment option is not as \nextensively studied. In a single institution retrospective review of 10 \nstudies over 6 years, an initial group of four patients treated with HILP \nwere identified.\n310 All patients experienced complete response, however \ntwo of the patients developed early metastatic recurrence and the other \ntwo had no evidence of disease at the last 36- month  follow- up. An \nadditional group of 12 patients treated with HILP were identified through systemic review. Twelve (86%) of the patients with follow -up had a \ncomplete response while one had stable disease and another partial response.

Of the remaining 12 individuals in the SSA group, 42% (N = 5) also experienced \ndisease control with a median PFS of 429 days.

The NCCN Panel recommendation is that both T -VEC and HILP \ncan be considered and may be useful in certain circumstances.  Local Disease  \nAdjuvant systemic therapy is not recommended outside of a clinical trial \nfor primary resectable disease. However, systemic therapies are \nrecommended for primary and recurrent locally advanced MCC if curative \nsurgery and curative RT are not feasible. The NC CN Panel considers all \nregimens for local disease as category 2A where there is uniform NCCN \nconsensus that the intervention is appropriate based on lower -level \nevidence. For primary laMCC, avelumab and pembrolizumab are preferred \nregimens, retifanlimab -dlwr is classified as  other recommended regimen, \nand neoadjuvant nivolumab as  useful in patients who are surgical \ncandidates . For recurrent laMCC, the preferred regimens are \npembrolizumab and retifanlimab- dlwr while avelumab is  recommended as  \nother recommended regimen.  \nRegional and Disseminated Disease  \nNeoadjuvant nivolumab is a NCCN category 2A regimen recommended in \ncertain circumstances  for patients with primary regional MCC disease.  \nPrimary and recurrent regional disease where curative surgery and \ncurative RT are not feasible along with metastatic disease have four \npreferred regimens recommended as treatment options. These preferred \ncategory 2A regimens are avelumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab , and \nretifanlimab -dlwr. Ipilimumab plus nivolumab is also a category 2A \nregimen, however it is only recommended under certain circumstances.  \nOther useful in certain circumstances regimens are recommended for consideration if anti -PD-L1 or anti -PD-1 therapy is contraindicated or the \ndisease has progressed on monotherapy regimens.  Topotecan , CAV \n(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin [or epirubicin], and vincristine) , \nipilimumab, octreotide long- acting release (LAR), pazopanib, and T- VEC \nare recommended under these conditions for primary/recurrent regional \nand disseminated disease.

Carboplatin or cisplatin \nwith or without etoposide are only recommended regimens for recurrent \nregional or disseminated disease.  \nFollow -up and Recurrence  \nRecurrence and development of lymph node and distant metastases in \nMCC are not uncommon.6,16- 20,84,223,315 Based on data from large \nretrospective analyses ( N > 100), the median time to recurrence in \npatients with MCC is about 8 to 9 months, with 90% of the recurrences \noccurring within 24 months.19,20,48,137 Time to local recurrence is generally \nshorter than for regional recurrence, and time to distant metastasis is \nlonger.6,18,19,222 Due to the fast -growing nature of the disease, detection of \nmultiple distant metastases at once is not uncommon.124 As described in \nPresence of Secondary Malignancy  above, patients who have had MCC \nare also at increased risk for a prior, concurrent, or subsequent second \nprimary malignancy .24,35,97- 100 \nMultiple retrospective analyses,71,73,93,236,247,308 data from a phase II study,256 \nand a few meta -analyses229,316,317 have shown that recurrence of MCC is \nassociated with poor prognosis. Collectively, t hese studies support that \nlocoregional recurrence is associated with the development  of distant \nmetastasis, and that all types of recurrences (local, regional, and distant) may be associated with poorer DSS and OS. A few retrospective studies \nfound no  significant association between recurrence and outcome \nmeasures including survival.\n48,194,232,235,236,250 \nThe NCCN Panel recommends close clinical follow -up for patients with \nMCC starting immediately after diagnosis and treatment. The physical examination should include a complete skin and complete lymph node \nexamination every 3 to 6 months for the first 3 years, then every 6 to 12 \nmonths thereafter. The recommended frequency of follow -up visits is \npurposely broad to allow for an individualized schedule based on the risk of recurrence, stage of disease, and other factors such as patient anxiety and clinician pr eference. The Panel’s recommendation for frequent clinical \nexams during the first 3 years also reflects  the fact that MCC will recur in \nup to half of patients, and most recurrences occur within the first few years \nafter diagnosis. Education regarding self -examination of the skin is useful \nfor patients with MCC because of their increased risk for other NMSCs .  \nImaging and other studies should be performed as clinically indicated, \nsuch as in cases of emergent adenopathy or organomegaly, unexplained \nchanges in liver function tests, or development of new suspicious \nsymptoms. As patients  with immunosuppression are at higher  risk for \nrecurrence, more frequent follow -up may be indicated. To lower the risk of \nrecurrence/progression, immunosuppressive treatments should be \nminimized as clinically feasible.  \nAs described  previously , MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing performed \nat initial workup may help guide surveillance.\n55,117- 119 Patients who are \noncoprotein antibody seronegative at diagnosis may be at higher risk of recurrence and may benefit from more intensive surveillance.\n55 For \npatients who are seropositive at baseline, the MCPyV oncoprotein \nantibody test may be a useful component of ongoing surveillance because \na rising titer can be an early indicator of recurrence.55 Additionally, MCC \nctDNA assessment is an option if the treating physician considers it \nclinically relevant to monitor disease burden with a typical surveillance of \nevery 3 months. 122 \nImaging Surveillance  \nRetrospective studies of follow -up imaging results have reported both local \nand systemic MCC recurrences detected by a variety of techniques, \nincludin g MRI,124 CT,124,125,135 and FDG -PET/CT.127,133- 135,137,141,142,145,318 Data \non the accuracy of imaging techniques for follow -up surveillance are \nlimited, because very few report whether or not the imaging findings were PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:46:23 PM.

One retrospective study of 61 patient s with \nstage III MC who were clinically asymptomatic and underwent surveillance \nFDG -PET/CT revealed a recurrence rate of 33%, with a median follow -up \nperiod of 4.8 years. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were determined to be 92%, 93%, and 93%, respect ively.\n318 \nFor disease features considered of higher risk (eg, stage IIIB or higher, immunosuppression), routine imaging surveillance should be considered. \nRecommended imaging modality options are the same as for the initial \nclinical workup in patients for whom regional or distant metastases are \nsuspected.\n Surveillance imaging is typically via diagnostic CT of \nchest/abdomen/pelvis with oral and IV contrast; neck CT is often included \nif the primary lesion was on head/neck.  Whole- body FDG -PET/CT may be \nindicated to evaluate for in- transit metastases if the primary lesion is on \nthe extremity.  \nTreatment of Recurrence  \nAlthough patients with MCC recurrence were included in many studies attempting to determine efficacy of specific treatments for MCC, few \nstudies reported outcomes specifically for MCC treated for \nrecurrence.\n48,69,73,194,229,235,236,246,256,257,309 One retrospective analysis of 55 \npatients with recurrent MCC identified several factors associated with \nimproved DSS after recurrence: location of primary MCC, type of \nrecurrence, disease- free interval, and whether the patient was disease \nfree after treat ment for recurrence.309 Another retrospective analysis  of 70 \npatients with locoregional MCC recurrence also found that the type of first \nrecurrence and disease- free interval were prognostic for development of \nsubsequent distant recurrence, and that the disease- free interval was \nprognostic for OS.246  Management of MCC  with local, locally advanced, regional , or \ndisseminated recurrence  is similar to clinical M1 disease. Systemic \ntherapy, RT, or surgery, or a combination of modalities, are among \ntreatment options for these patients. Clinical trial enrollment is preferred, if \navailable. All patients should receive best supportive care, and depending \non the extent of the disease and other patient -specific circumstances, \npalliative care alone may be the most appropriate option for some patients  \n(See NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care , available at www.NCCN.org ). \nFor recurrence of in -transit disease, the Panel recommends treating the \npatient as a Clinical N+ in -transit disease where a multidisciplinary \nconsultation at an experienced center is encouraged and clinical trials, \nsurgery, radiation, or certain systemic therapies may be considered as \nadditional treatment.
