Needle biopsy is not recommended for skull base tumors. \n• Appropriate communication between the surgeon, musculoskeletal or interventional radiologist, and bone pathologist is critical.\n• Fresh tissue may be needed for molecular studies and tissue banking.\n• In general, not following appropriate biopsy procedures may lead to adverse patient outcomes.\nSurgery\n• Wide excision should achieve histologically negative surgical margins.\n• Negative surgical margins optimize local tumor control.\n• Local tumor control may be achieved by either limb-sparing excision or limb amputation (individualized for a given patient). \n• Limb-sparing excision is preferred to optimize function if reasonable functional expectations can be achieved.\n• Final pathologic evaluation should include assessment of surgical margins, size/dimensions of tumor, and response to preoperative therapy.\n• Fresh tissue may be needed for molecular studies and tissue banking.\nLaboratory Studies\n• Laboratory studies such as CBC, LDH, and ALP may have relevance in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients with bone \nsarcoma and should be done prior to definitive treatment and periodically during treatment and surveillance.\n• Consider molecular studies to delineate potential therapeutic options.\nTreatment\n• Fertility issues should be addressed with patients prior to commencing chemotherapy.\n• See NCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology . \n• Select patients with osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma may benefit from a referral for genetic consultation and testing based on family \nhistory with a genetic predisposition for bone sarcomas. \n• Care for patients with bone cancer should be delivered directly by physicians on the multidisciplinary team (category 1).  \nSee TEAM-1.\nLong-Term Follow-up and Surveillance/Survivorship\n• Patients should have a survivorship prescription to schedule follow-up with a multidisciplinary team.\n• Life-long follow-up is recommended for surveillance and treatment of late effects of surgery , radiation, and chemotherapy in  \nlong-term survivors.\n• See NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship .PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-2 Overview \nPrimary  bone cancers are extremely rare neoplasms accounting for \n~0.2% of all cancers, although the true incidence is difficult to determine \nsecondary to the rarity of these tumors .1 In 20 25 an estimated 3,770  \npeople will be diagnosed in the United States and 2,190  people will die \nfrom the se disease s.2 \nPrimary  bone cancers demonstrate wide clinical heterogeneity and may \nbe curable with proper treatment. In adults, chondrosarcoma is the most \ncommon primary bone cancer, accounting for more than 40% of newly \ndiagnosed bone cancers, followed by osteosarcoma (~25%), chordoma \n(10%), and Ewing sarcoma (8%).3 Other less common primary bone \ntumors include giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). In children and adolescents, osteosarcoma \nand Ewing sarcoma are far more common than chondrosarcoma and \nchordoma.\n3,4 High-grade UPS of bone and  GCTB are relatively rare \ntumors , with each  constituting < 5% of primary bone tumors.5 GCTB has \nboth benign and exceptionally rare malignant forms. Various types of \nbone cancers are named based on their his tologic  line of differentiation.  \nChondrosarcomas differentiate toward  cartilage, osteosarcomas toward \nbone, angiosarcoma and epithelioid  hemangioendothelioma show \nendothelial (vascular) differentiation, and chordoma  shows notochordal \ndifferentiation.  Several primary bone cancers, including Ewing  sarcoma, \nare of unknown lineage. Chondrosarcoma  is more prevalent in \nindividuals >50 years of age.6 Osteosarcoma and Ewing  sarcoma \ndevelop mainly in children and young adults. Chordoma is more common in males, with the peak incidence in the fifth to sixth decade of life.\n7-9  \nThe pathogenesis and etiology of most bone cancers remain unclear. \nGene rearrangements between the FET (usually EWSR1 ) and ETS \n(usually FLI1) family of genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis \nof Ewing sarcoma.10-14 Specific germline mutations have been linked to  the development of  osteosarcoma .15 Li-Fraumeni syndrome, \ncharacterized by a germline mutation in the TP53 gene, is associated \nwith a high risk of developing cancer, including  osteosarcoma.16-18 \nOsteosarcoma is the most common second primary malignancy in \npatients with a history of retinoblastoma,  characterized by a germline \nmutation in the retinoblastoma gene RB1.19-21 Increased incidences of \nosteosarcoma have also been associated with other genetic mutations \nand inherited genetic predisposition syndromes.21 Osteosarcoma is also \nthe most common radiation- induced bone sarcoma.22,23  \nThe development of multiagent chemotherapy regimens for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment has markedly  improved the prognosis for patients \nwith osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.\n24,25 With current multimodality \ntreatment, approximately 60% to 70% of patients diagnosed with \nosteosarcoma (without clinically evident metastases)  are cured, and \n~90% of patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma can be treated with \nlimb-sparing approaches .26-28 Five-year relative survival rates have \nimproved to 82% in patients with localized Ewing sarcoma .29 In patients \nwith Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma, a cure is still achievable in \nselected patients diagnosed with metastatic disease at presentation.30,31 \nThe 5 -year survival across all types of primary bone cancers is 68%.1 \nThe NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) \nfor Bone Cancer focus on chordoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, \nand osteosarcoma. The guidelines also provide recommendations for \ntreating GCTB. Although typically benign, GCTB is locally aggressive and can lead to significant bone dest ruction. Malignant transformation is \nalso possible.  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN Guidelines\n® are available at www.NCCN.org .

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-3 Literature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines for Bone \nCancer, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to \nobtain key literature published in bone cancer  since the previous \nGuidelines update, using the following search terms: chond rosarcoma OR \nchordoma OR Ewing s arcoma OR giant cell tumor of the bone OR \nosteosarcoma OR bone sarcoma OR primary bone cancer OR primary bone neoplasm OR primary bone tumor .  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II ; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV;  \nGuideline;  Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; \nMeta -Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional \nsources deemed as relevant to these guidelines and discussed by the \nPanel have been included in this version of the Discussion section (eg, \ne-publications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). Recommendations for \nwhich high- level evidence is lacking are based on the P anel’s review of \nlower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.32 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and ant i-weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN \nGuidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nStaging \nThe eighth edition of the AJCC staging classification (201 8) is based on \nthe assessment of histologic grade (G), tumor size (T), and presence of \nregional (N) and/or distant metastases (M).33  \nThe NCCN Panel would like to clarify that although some studies \ninterpret imaging before chemotherapy treatment based on the extent of \ntumor invasion relative to the periosteum (eg, extraperiosteal, \nintraperiosteal) for prognostic purposes, these terms do not specifically \noccur in any validated staging systems and the significance is unknown.   \nPrinciples of Bone Cancer Management \nMultidisciplinary Team Involvement  \nPrimary bone tumors and selected metastatic tumors should be \nevaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team of physicians with \ndemonstrated expertise in the management of these tumors.  The core \nteam should include, at minimum, the following: orthopedic oncologist, bone pathologist, medical/pediatric oncologist, radiation oncologist, and \nmusculoskeletal radiologist. Other specialists who may be critical in \ncertain cases include the following: thoracic surgeon, plastic surgeon, \ninterventional radiologist, physiatrist, vascular/general surgeon, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-4 neurosurgeon/orthopedic spine surgeon, and palliative care physician. \nAdditional surgical subspecialties may be included as clinically indicated.    \nLong- term surveillance  and follow -up are necessary when considering \nthe risk of recurrence and comorbidities associated with systemic \ntherapy and radiation therapy (RT). Life- long follow -up is recommended \nfor surveillance and treatment of late effects of surgery, RT, and \nsystemic therapy in long -term survivors. Patients  should be given a \nsurvivorship prescription to schedule follow -up with a multidisciplinary \nteam.   \nFertility  issues should be discussed with appropriate patients34. For \nfurther details and recommendations, including information on disease - and survivorship- related issues for adolescent and young adult \n(AYA) patients, please refer to the  \nNCCN Guidelines for Adolescent and \nYoung Adult (AYA) Oncology . \nFinally, select  patients with a family history of genetic predisposition to \nbone sarcomas may benefit from genetic consultation and testing.  \nDiagnostic Workup  \nSuspicion of a malignant bone tumor in a patient with a symptomatic \nlesion often begins when a poorly marginated lesion is seen on a plain \nradiograph .  \nIn patients < 40 years, an aggressive, symptomatic bone lesion has a \nsignificant risk of being a malignant primary bone tumor . Referral to an \northopedic oncologist should be considered prior to further workup.  \nIn patients ≥ 40 years of age,  workup for potential bone metastasis is \nrecommended as indicated. This would include history and physical \n(H&P), bone scan, chest x -ray, and computed tomography (CT) of the \nchest/abdomen/pelvis (C/A/P) with intravenous contrast. Additional testing, such as serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), prostate -specific \nantigen (PSA) test, or mammogram may also be included.\n35 Other  \nimaging studies  such as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG) -positron emission \ntesting (PET)/CT (category 2B) may  be performed as clinically \nindicated.35-37 \nPrior to biopsy, all patients with suspected bone sarcoma should \nundergo complete staging, and consultation with an oncologist  regarding \npre-biopsy imaging.   \nDepending on the suspected type of primary bone cancer, the standard staging workup can include H&P, x -ray, cross -sectional imaging of the \nprimary site ( eg, contrast -enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) \nof the entire bone, and/or CT scan if MRI contraindicated),  screening \nMRI of spinal axis, and CT C/A/P with contrast.  \n38 FDG -PET/CT and/or \nbone scan can be considered if clinically indicated.   \nFertility consultation should be offered to individuals of child -bearing \npotential if cytotoxic chemotherapy will be given.  The American Society \nfor Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends that conversations \nconcerning fertility be undertaken by an interdisciplinary medical team comprised of oncologists, reproductive endocrinologists and urologists, \nand reproductive surgeons trained  in fertility  preservation methods  and \nthat fertility preservation programs be affiliated with an experienced \nassisted reproduc tive technology (ART) program .\n39,40  \nLaboratory studies, such as  CBC, CMP  with calcium to assess for \nhypercalcemia, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase \n(ALP) should be done prior to definitive treatment and periodically during \ntreatment and surveillance. Molecular studies can be considered to \ndelineate potential therapeutic options.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-5 Biopsy  \nPercutaneous biopsy (core needle ) or incisional (open) biopsy are the \ntwo techniques historically used in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal \nlesions.41,42  \nOpen biopsy is the most accurate method because of larger sample size, \nwhich is useful for performing additional studies such as \nimmunohistochemistry or cytogenetics.43 However, open biopsy requires \ngeneral or regional anesthesia and operating room  facilities; moreover, it \ncan lead to contamination of surrounding tissues. Core biopsy can be \nperformed under moderate  sedation . Core needle biopsy is also highly \ndiagnostic,  with accuracy rates ranging from 88% to 96% when adequate \nsamples are obtained.44-47 Core biopsy is associated with a low \ncomplication rate and c ost savings may be realized when needle biopsy \nis employed in selected patients.44,47,48 Advances in imaging techniques \nhave contributed to the increasing use of image- guided percutaneous \nbiopsy for the diagnosis of primary and secondary bone tumors.49 \nFurthermore, rates of complications, particularly altered treatment and \noutcomes, are considerably higher with open biopsy.42,50 Although  no \nrandomized controlled trials have compared core needle biopsy with \nopen biopsy , the higher complication rate and cost of open biopsy have \nresulted in a shift to the use of primarily core biopsy for diagnosis.  \nThe guidelines recommend core needle or open biopsy to confirm the \ndiagnosis of primary bone tumor prior to any surgical procedure or \nfixation of primary site. Biopsy should be performed at a center that will \nprovide definitive treatment for patients with a suspected primary \nmalignant bone tumor. At the time of biopsy, careful consideration should \nbe given to appropriate measures to protect against impending  \npathologic fracture. The placement of biopsy is critical to the planning of limb-sparing surgery . A multidisciplinary approach including the \nradiologist and orthopedic oncologic surgeon, should be taken to follow appropriate biopsy procedures and decrease risk of  adverse patient \noutcomes.\n51,52 In a multicenter review of 597 patients with \nmusculoskeletal tumors, alteration of the treatment plan (complex \nresection or the use of adjunctive treatment) was encountered in 19% of \npatients and unnecessary amputation was performed in 18 patients.50     \nBoth core needle and open biopsy  techniques are associated with risk of \nlocal tumor recurrence,  either by tumor spillage or tumor seeding along \nthe biopsy tract, if the scar is not removed en bloc during the tumor \nresection. The risk of tumor seeding is less with core needle biopsy .53-55 \nNevertheless , the same principles should be applied for core needle and \nopen biopsy. Appropriate communication between the surgeon, \nmusculoskeletal or interventional radiologist, and bone pathologist is \ncritical in planning the biopsy route.  In the case of children, consultation \nwith a pediatric oncologist is recommended.  It is essential to select the \nbiopsy route in collaboration with the surgeon to ensure that the biopsy tract lies within the planned resection bed so that it can be resected with \nthe same wide margins as the primary tumor during surgery. Although \nthe risk of tumor seeding is not significant with FNA biopsy, it is not \nsuitable for the diagnosis of primary lesions since the diagnostic \naccuracy of FNA is less than that of core needle biopsy.\n56   \nSurgery  \nSurgical margins should be negative  for most sarcomas, wide enough to \nminimize potential local recurrence, and narrow enough to maximize \nfunction. Wide excision implies histologically negative surgical margins \nwhich  is necessary to optimize local control. Local control may be \nachieved either by limb -sparing surgery or amputation. In selected \ncases, amputation may be the most appropriate option to achieve this \ngoal. However, limb -sparing surgery is preferred if reasonable functional \noutcomes can be achieved. Final pathologic evaluation should include \nassessment of surgical margins and size/dimensions of tumor.

The \nresponse to preoperative therapy should be evaluated utilizing pathologic \nmapping. Consultation with a physiatrist may assist with  mobility training \nand prescribing  an appropriate rehabilitation program.  \nRadiation Therapy  \nRT is used either as an adjuvant to surgery for patients with resectable \ntumors or as definitive therapy in patients with tumors not amenable to \nsurgery. Specialized techniques such as intensity -modulated RT (IMRT); \nparticle beam RT with protons, carbon ions, or other heavy ions; or \nstereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) /stereotactic RT (SRT) should be \nconsidered as clinically indicated in order to deliver high radiation doses while maximizing normal tissue sparing.\n57,58 RT should be administered \nat the same specialized center that is providing surgical and systemic interventions. See Principles of Radiation Therapy  in the algorithm for \ntreatment volumes and radiation doses specific to each subtype.    \nChondrosarcoma  \nChondrosarcomas characteristically produce cartilage matrices from \nneoplastic tissue devoid of osteoid and may occur at any age, but they are \nmore common in older adults.59,60  They may be classified according to the \nlocation from which they arise, with the pelvis and the proximal femur \nbeing the most common primary sites  of origin . They may also be \ndistinguished by their location along the bone  as follows : 1) primary or \ncentral lesions (arising normally from the medullary cavity) originating from \npreviously normal -appearing bone preformed from cartilage; or 2) \nsecondary or peripheral tumors  (arising from the periosteum)  that develop \nfrom preexisting benign cartilage lesions, such as enchondromas, or from \nthe cartilaginous portion of an osteochondroma.59,61,62 Conventional \nchondrosarcoma of the bone constitutes approximately nearly 90% of all \nchondrosarcomas  and of these , 90% are low to intermediate grade.63  Low-grade (grade 1) tumors in the appendicular skeleton are currently \nclassified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as atypical \ncartilaginous tumors, and are sometimes also referred to as low -grade \nintracompartmental appendicular tumors, while those that occur in the axial skeleton are considered as grade 1 chondrosarcoma.\n5  \nMalignant transformation has been reported in patients with Ollier disease (enchondromatosis) and Maffucci syndrome (enchondromatosis \nassociated with soft tissue hemangioma).\n64 The peripheral or secondary \ntumors are usually low grade with infrequent metastasis.65 Nearly 65 % of \nchondrosarcoma cases and nearly all cases of Ollier d isease and Maffucci \nsyndrome are related to isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH1  or IDH2 ) \nmutations .63,66- 68 Other implicated genetic aberrations include inactivating \nmutations of CDKN2A  and COL2A1.62 In addition to conventional \nchondrosarcoma, there are several non -conventional  subtypes constituting \nabout 10% to 15% of all chondrosarcomas.59 These include clear cell, \njuxtacortical, dedifferentiated, myxoid, and mesenchymal forms of \nchondrosarcoma.59,69,70 Primary skeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma ( myxoid \nchondrosarcoma of bone)  is an extremely rare neoplasm that has not \nbeen fully characterized as a distinct clinicopathologic entity.71,72 It is \nconsidered to be a myxoid variant of intermediate-  or high- grade \nchondrosarcoma and is commonly located in the bones around the hip \njoint.59,72 An epidemiologic study of mesenchymal chondrosarcomas using \nthe SEER database found that 40% of these were skeletal and 60% were \nextraskeletal.73 Research suggests that alterations in the retinoblastoma \npathway are present in a significant majority of clear cell, dedifferentiated, \nand mesenchymal chondrosarcomas.69 \nExtraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, on the other hand, is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that is characterized by chromosomal translocations \nt(9;22)(q22;q11 -12) or t(9;17)(q22;q11), generating the fusion genes \nEWS::CHN (EWSR1 ::NR4A3)  or RBP56 ::CHN (TAF2N::NR4A3) , PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

For recommendations on the treatment of e xtraskeletal myxoid \nchondrosarcoma , see the  NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma .   \nSymptoms of chondrosarcoma are usually mild and depend on tumor size \nand location. Patients with pelvic or axial lesions typically present later in \nthe disease course, as the associated pain has a more insidious onset and often occurs when the tumor has reached a significant size.\n78-80 Central \nchondrosarcomas demonstrate cortical destruction and loss of medullary bone trabeculations on radiographs, as well as calcification and \ndestruction.\n79 MRI will show the intramedullary involvement as well as \nextraosseous extension of the tumor. Secondary  lesions arise from \npreexisting lesions. Serial radiographs will demonstrate a slow increase in size of the osteochondroma or enchondroma. A cartilage “cap” measuring \n>2 cm on a pre -existing lesion or documented growth after skeletal \nmaturity should raise the suspicion of sarcomatous transformation.\n81  \nPrognostic Factors  \nWhether the lesion is primary or secondary, central or peripheral, the \nanatomic location, histologic grade, and size of the lesion are essential \nprognostic features.73,78,82- 86 In an analysis of 2890 patients with \nchondrosarcoma from the SEER database, female sex, a low histologic grade, and local surgical stage were associated with a significant \ndisease- specific survival benefit in the univariate analysis, whereas only \ngrade and stage had significant association with disease- specific survival \non multivariate analysis.\n87 An epidemiologic study examined the impact of demographic and tumor characteristics on OS.73 No differences in OS \nwere observed between skeletal and extraskeletal mesenchymal \nchondrosarcoma, with a 5- and 10- year OS of 51% and 43% , respectively. \nAnatomic tumor location was a significant prognostic factor, with poorer OS observed among patients with axial versus cranial or appendicular \ntumor locations. Cranial tumors had different clinical behavior compared \nwith axial and appendicular locations , with data suggesting better  OS for \nyounger patients. Prognostic factors were also examined in a \nretrospective, multi -institutional analysis of 225 patients with low- grade \nchondrosarcoma.\n88 Metastasis -free survival (MFS) probability was 95% at \n5 years and 92% at 10 years. A low histologic grade and no recurrence \nhad a significant MFS benefit, but tumor size at diagnosis and surgical \nmargin width had no effect on MFS. In a SEER database analysis, \ndifferences in the presence of metastasis were noted among the various \nchondrosarcoma subtypes .70 Dedifferentiated (19.8%) followed by \nmesenchymal (10.6%) chondrosarcoma were most associated with the \npresence of metastasis on presentation, whereas juxtacortical \nchondrosarcoma was least associated (2.1%) with the presence of \nmetastasis on presentation.70 Similarly, median survival was found to be \nlowest with the dedifferentiated subtype (11 months) and highest with the juxtacortical subtype (97 months) .\n70  \nTreatment  \nSurgery  \nWide excision with negative margins is the preferred primary treatment for patients with large tumors and pelvic localization, irrespective of the \ngrade.\n84,89- 91 Wide resection with adequate surgical margins is associated \nwith higher EFS and OS rates in patients with chondrosarcoma of axial skeleton and pelvic girdle. The 10- year OS and EFS rates were 61% and \n44%, respectively, for patients who underwent resection with adequate surgical margins compared to the corresponding survival rates of 17% and \n0% for those who underwent resection with inadequate surgical margins.\n92 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-8 Intralesional curettage with adjuvant cryosurgery has been shown to be \nassociated with low rates of recurrence in patients with atypical \ncartilaginous tumors (formerly known as grade I intracompartmental \nchondrosarcomas) .93-95 In selected patients with low -grade and less \nradiographically aggressive, non -pelvic chondrosarcomas, intralesional \nexcision can be used as an alternative to wide excision without \ncompromising outcomes.96-99 This approach should be restricted to \nextremity tumors.100 Intralesional excision  is considered the standard \ntreatment for extremity chondrosarcoma  tumors . In a meta -analysis \ncomparing outcome in patients with central,  atypical cartilaginous tumor  of \nthe long bones  following either intralesional excision or  wide resection, \nthere was little difference in the recurrence- free survival between both \ngroups  after 24 months . The rate of major complications was found to be \nhigher following wide resection of the lesion (230 per 1000 vs . 40 per 1000 \nfor intralesional curett age).101  \nRadiation Therapy  \nClinical data demonstrate that RT also has a role in the treatment of \nchondrosarcoma.59,60 A systematic review of the role of postoperative \nradiation in skull -base chondrosarcomas compared progression- free \nsurvival ( PFS)  after 3, 5,  and 10 years in 1388 patients, of which 186 \nreceived surgery only.102 At 5 years, PFS rates varied from 60% to 92.9% \nversus 57.1% to 100% for the surgery -only approach compared to the \npostoperative radiotherapy group, respectively. Recurrence rates ranged from 5.3% to 39.0% in the surgery -only group to 1.5% to  42.9% in the \npostoperative radiation group.  A prospective outcomes study of patients \nwith chondrosarcomas (n = 17) of the sacrum, cervical spine, and \nthoracolumbar spine found that high- dose external proton beam RT had a  \n4-year OS rate of 72% and more than half of patients (58%) had local \ncontrol of disease. Treating patients with RT at the time of diagnosis is \nsuggested to reduce the likelihood of local progression.\n103 Proton beam RT alone or in combination with photon beam RT has been \nassociated with an excellent local tumor control and long- term survival in \nthe treatment of patients with low -grade skull base and cervical spine \nchondrosarcomas .104-112 In two separate studies, proton beam RT resulted \nin local control rates of 92% and 94% in patients with skull base chondrosarcoma.\n104,108 Noel and colleagues  reported a 3- year local control \nrate of 92% in 26 patients with chondrosarcoma of the skull base and upper cervical spine treated with surgical resection followed by a \ncombination of proton and photon beam RT.\n107 In a larger series involving \n229 patients with skull base chondrosarcoma the combination of proton and photon beam RT resulted in 10- year local control rates of 94%.\n105 \nCarbon ion RT has also been reported to result in high local control rates in patients with skull base chondrosarcoma\n113,114  and patients with other \nunresectable chondrosarcomas.115 SRS has also been evaluated for \nadjuvant treatment of skull base chondrosarcoma.116  \nSystemic Therapy  \nChemotherapy is generally not effective in chondrosarcoma, particularly \nfor the conventional and dedifferentiated subtypes.117 Mitchell and \ncolleagues reported that adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and \ndoxorubicin was associated with improved survival in patients with \ndedifferentiated chondrosarcoma.118 However, this finding could not be \nconfirmed in other studies.119- 122 For example, a SEER database analysis \nof 185 patients with dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma reported no OS \nbenefit associated with perioperative chemotherapy.122 Furthermore, a \nreview of outcomes for 113 patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma reported that the addition of chemotherapy was associated with reduced \nrisk of recurrence and death.\n123 Another report from the German study \ngroup confirmed that the outcome was better in younger patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma who received chemotherapy.\n124 In the \nabsence of data from prospective randomized trials, the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of chondrosarcomas remains undefined.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-9 A multicenter, phase 2,  single -arm study  in patients with advanced \nsarcoma evaluated dasatinib,  the small -molecule inhibitor of kinases \n(including SRC family, BCR ::ABL , c-KIT, and platelet -derived growth factor \nreceptors  [PDGFRs] α and β). The Sarcoma Alliance for Research \nthrough Collaboration (SARC)  coordinated this study, known as \nSARC0 09, which included three parallel trials focused on different rare \nsarcoma histologic types: aggressive sarcoma subtypes, indolent \nsarcoma subtypes, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The indolent \nsubstudy included patients with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic soft \ntissue or bone sarcoma, which included 33 patients with grade 1 or 2 chondrosarcoma.\n125 The primary endpoint was PFS at 6 months using the \nChoi criteria, which for patients with chondrosarcoma was 47%, just below the 50% cutoff for an active agent. Six patients had objective tumor \nresponse and four patients (12%) had stable disease for >1 year, \nsuggesting some tumor control. An editorial published in the same issue of Cancer  compared results of this and other trials using different \nchemotherapies for chondrosarcoma and found improved PFS at 6 months with dasatinib.\n126  \nSimilarly, p azopanib is an oral, multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic \nactivity. A single -arm, multicenter, phase 2 study evaluated the safety and \nefficacy of pazopanib in 42 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nconventional chondrosarcoma. The primary endpoint of the study was disease control rate (DCR) at week 16 and the secondary endpoints \nincluded PFS and OS. Overall, treatment with pazopanib resulted in a \nDCR of 43% at 16 weeks, a median PFS of 7.9 months, and a median OS of 17.6 months.  Prior reports of the antitumor activity of pazopanib \n(including a case report and a small cohort study) in unresectable or \nmetastatic chondrosarcoma are also favorable.\n63  \nA multicenter, open -label , dose -escalation and -expansion phase 1 trial  in \npatients  with IDH1 -mutant advanced solid tumors, including 21 patients with advanced chondrosarcoma, evaluated the response to ivosidenib, a \nselective IDH1 inhibitor.  Median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI, 1.9– 7.4 \nmonths), PFS at 6 months was 39.5%, and 52% of patients had stable \ndisease. All patients demonstrated decreased plasma 2 -hydroxyglutarate \n(2-HG) levels following treatment .127 Given these data, i vosidenib is \nincluded as a treatment option for patients with IDH1 -mutant conventional \nor dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma.   \nNCCN Recommendations  \nThe histologic grade and tumor locations are the most important variables \nthat determine the choice of primary treatment  for chondrosarcoma . \nRadiologic features and size should also be considered when determining \nlocal treatment.   \nIntralesional excision with or without  a surgical adjuvant is the primary \ntreatment option for patients with  atypical cartilaginous  lesions ; \nobservation is also an option.97,98  \nHigh-grade (grade II, III), clear cell,  extracompartmental, grade I axial  \ntumors or low-grade extracompartmental  appendicular  lesions, if \nresectable, should be treated with wide excision obtaining negative surgical margins. Wide excision should provide negative surgical margins \nand may be achieved by either limb -sparing surgery or amputation.  \nPostoperative treatment with proton and/or photon beam RT may be \nuseful for patients with tumors in an unfavorable location not amenable to resection, especially in chondrosarcomas of the skull base and axial \nskeleton.\n59,60 RT can be considered for patients with borderline resectable \nor unresectable tumors . However, since there are not enough data to \nsupport the use of RT in patients with chondrosarcoma, the P anel has \nincluded this option as  a category 2B recommendation.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-10 Patients  with mesenchymal chondrosarcomas may be treated with \nsystemic therapy regimens used for  Ewing  sarcoma , while those with \ndedifferentiated chondrosarcomas may be treated with systemic therapy \nregimens used to treat osteosarcoma . Both of these options are  category \n2B recommendations within the Guidelines .  \nThere are no standard chemotherapy options for conventional \nchondrosarcoma grades 1– 3 that are recommended by the NCCN Panel. \nHowever, ivosidenib can be considered as an option for certain patients \nwith chondrosarcoma with IDH1 mutations.  Next-generation sequencing \n(NGS) or targeted exon sequencing can be used to detect IDH1  mutations  \nand other potential targeted therapy opportunities. See the Molecular \nTesting and Additional Treatment Options  section.  \nMetastatic  Disease  \nMetastatic chondrosarcoma that is not dedifferentiated or mesenchymal \neither after recurrence or at presentation ca n be classified as \noligometastatic or widespread disease.  In general, patients with \noligometastatic disease are amenable to local control (potentially \nrendering it disease free), such as with surgical excision  or RT, or treated  \nas part of a clinical trial  (goal is disease free/cure; more likely to proceed \nwith surgery or radiation) .  \nFor oligometastatic disease that is resectable, NCCN recommends \nsurgical excision of all sites of disease, if possible. For oligometastatic \ndisease that is unresectable, consider RT that may include ablative \ntherapy. For widespread disease, NCCN recommends  considering RT, \nsurgery, and/or ablative therapies for symptomatic sites , systemic \ntherapy , or clinical trial.  Dasatinib and pazopanib are included as category \n2A treatment options  for patients with metastatic or widespread \nchondrosarcoma.  NCCN recommends  that comprehensive genomic \nprofiling ( CGP) with a validated and/or FDA -approved assay should be considered for patients with metastatic chondrosarcoma  to identify \npotential targeted therapy opportunities.  In addition, testing for  tumor \nmutational burden  (TMB ) and mismatch repair ( MMR )/microsatellite \ninstability ( MSI) as determined by a validated and/or FDA -approved \nassay should be considered. See Molecular Testing and Additional \nTreatment Options  below.   \nSurveillance  \nSurveillance for atypical cartilaginous tumors consists of a physical exam  \nand imaging. Imaging with r adiographs of the primary site, and/or \ncross- sectional imaging (CT with contrast or MRI with and without \ncontrast) are recommended every 6 to 12 months for 2 years and then \nyearly  as clinically indicated.   \nSurveillance for h igh-grade (grade II, III), clear cell,  extracompartmental, \ngrade I axial  tumors or low-grade extracompartmental  appendicular  \nlesions  consists of a physical exam, radiographs of the primary site, and/or \ncross- sectional imaging (CT  with contrast or MRI with and without \ncontrast ) as clinically indicated as well as chest imaging based on \nphysician’s concern for risk of recurrence. Chest imaging should occur \nevery 3 to 6 months (may include CT with or without contrast at least \nbiannually) for the first 5 years and yearly thereafter for a minimum of 10 \nyears  as clinically indicated , as late metastases and recurrences after 5 \nyears are more common with chondrosarcoma than with other sarcomas.\n83 Functional assessment should be performed at every visit.  \nRelapsed Disease  \nFor local recurrence of atypical cartilaginous tumors, workup including imaging of primary site, chest imaging, and biopsy to confirm diagnosis \nshould be performed. Bone scans are optional. If there is malignant \ntransformation, treat as described below.

If there are positive margins,  RT (category 2B)  or re-excision  \nto achieve negative surgical margins should be considered. If there are  \nnegative surgical margins , observation is recommended. Unresectable \nrecurrences are treated with RT (category 2B) . A study in 25 patients \ndemonstrated effective local control and low acute toxicity with carbon ion \nRT in patients with recurrent skull base chordoma or chondrosarcoma.128 \nPatients with systemic recurrence should follow the recommendations \ndescribed above for Metastatic Disease.  \nChordoma  \nChordomas arise from the embryonic remnants of the notochord and are \nmore commonly diagnosed in adults  aged 40 to 75 years .129 Chordomas \npredominantly arise in the axial skeleton, with the sacrum (50% –60%), \nskull base (25% –35%), and spine (15%) being the most common primary \nsites.8,9,130 Chordomas are traditionally classified by the WHO into three \nhistologic variants: conventional, chondroid, and dedifferentiated. \nConventional chordomas are the most common histologic subtype \ncharacterized by the absence of cartilaginous or mesenchymal \ncomponents. Chondroid chordomas present with histologic features of \nchordoma and cartilage elements,  accounting for 5% to 15% of all \nchordomas. Dedifferentiated chordomas constitute about 2% to 8% of all chordomas and have features of high- grade pleomorphic s pindle cell soft \ntissue sarcoma and an aggressive clinical course.\n130 An additional subset \nof chordoma has been identified in children . Poorly differentiated \nchordoma is characterized molecularly by the absence of SMARCB1  \nexpression. The protein encoded by SMARCB1  is a chromatin remodeling \nagent and its absence is also implicated in the pathogenesis of some \nsarcomas, including but not limited to epithelioid sarcoma, malignant \nrhabdoid tumor,  and epithel ioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). It is reported that poorly differentiated chordoma may be more \ncommon in the pediatric population and show a predilection for occurrence \nin the skull base and cervical spine. Although further research is \nwarranted, poorly differentiated chordoma is considered to be more \naggressive than either the conventional or chondroid variants with a \npoorer OS.131 Chordomas of the spine and sacrum present with localized \ndeep pain or radiculopathies, whereas cervical chordomas can cause airway obstruction or dysphagia and might present as an oropharyngeal \nmass. Neurologic deficit is more often associated with chordom as of the \nskull base and mobile spine than chordomas of sacrococcygeal region.\n8 A \nreview of 47 patients with skull base chordomas suggested that male sex \nwas associated with worse PFS and OS.132  \nWorkup  \nInitial workup should include H&P  examination with adequate cross-\nsectional  imaging of primary site  (ie, x-ray, MRI  ± CT ), screening MRI of \nspinal axis, and C/A/P  CT with contrast . Skull base to mid- thigh FDG -\nPET/CT or bone scan (if FDG -PET/CT is negative) can be considered for \nunusual cases. Benign notochordal cell tumors (BNCTs) are considered \nprecursors to chordomas and do not require surgical management.133-135 \nCT and MRI may be useful in distinguishing BNCTs from chordomas.136,137  \nFor skull base chordomas, CT is useful to delineate bone destruction and the presence of calcifications, whereas MRI is the modality of choice to \ndefine the tumor margin from brain, characteriz e the position and \nextension of tumors into the adjacent soft tissue structures, and visualiz e \nblood vessels.\n138-140 For sacrococcygeal chordomas, CT and MRI are \nuseful to assess the soft tissue involvement, calcifications, and epidural \nextension.141-143 MRI provides more precise and superior contrast with \nsurrounding soft tissues compared with CT and is helpful to assess recurrent or metastatic lesions.\n141,142 CT is also of particular importance to \nassess bony involvement, calcifications, and soft tissue and epidural PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

Another study found that aggressive microsurgical resection is \nassociated with long- term, tumor -free survival with good functional \noutcome in patients with cranial base chordomas; gross total removal was achieved in 72% of patients resulting in local control rates of 50%.\n154 In a \n10-year meta- analysis that included 802 patients with skull base \nchordoma, patients with incomplete resection were 3.83 times more likely \nto experience a recurrence at 5 years than  patients with complete \nresection.157,158 In a meta -analysis of 33 noncomparative studies \nevaluating the management of sacrococcygeal chordomas, the overall mortality rate was found to be lowest with surgical resection followed by \nadjuvant RT (16%) when compared to either surgical resection (28%) or \nRT (43%) alone. Additionally, the PFS at 60- month follow -up was higher \nafter surgical resection with adjuvant RT (74%) than when compared to only surgery (55%) or only RT (36%) .\n163  \nRadiation Therapy  \nRT (preoperative, postoperative, or intraoperative) is used in combination \nwith surgery to improve local control and DFS for patients with resectable \nchordomas. Various retrospective studies and case series have \ndemonstrated improved local control and DFS with combined surgical/RT \napproaches for treating spinal/ sacral103,110,164 -168 and clival/ skull base \nchordomas .153,166,169 -173 \nA retrospective review analyzed the role of RT following surgical resection \nin 1478 patients with skull base, sacral , and mobile spine chordomas.174 In \nthose with positive surgical margins, the 5 -year survival rate was \nsignificantly higher among those who received adjuvant RT than the \npatients who received surgery alone (82.3% vs . 70.6%; P = .03). In \ncontrast, adjuvant RT following surgery did not improve the survival rate \namong patients with negative surgical margins.    \nParticle beam RT (either alone or in combination with photon beam RT) \nwith high -energy protons104-107,110,165,172,175 -181 or carbon ions113,114,181- 186 \nresulted in local control rates ranging from 46 % to 92% in patients with \nskull base as well as extracranial chordomas involving the spine and sacrum.  Carbon ion RT also resulted  favorable outcomes for individuals \nwith skull- base chordomas  regarding local control, OS, and toxicity profile.  \n187 The 5- and 10 -year local control rates were 80% and 56%, respectively.   \nA prospective trial of high- dose photon/proton RT in 50 patients with bone \nsarcomas of the spine (n  = 29 chordoma, 14 chondrosarcoma, 7 other \nhistologies) resulted in 5 - and 8 -year actuarial local control rates of 94% PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

In this trial, the i ntent -to-treat best \nobjective response was 1/27 ( 3.7%; 95% CI,  0.1% –19.0% ), 9-month PFS \nwas 73.0% (95% CI , 46.1–88.0) , and 12- month OS was  86.5% (95% CI , \n55.8– 96.5).207,208 \nDasatinib is also included as a systemic therapy option based on data \nfrom the SARC009 indolent substudy that included 32 patients with \nunresectable, recurrent, or metastatic chordoma.125 The primary endpoint \nwas PFS at 6 months using the Choi criteria, which for patients with \nchordoma was 54%.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-14 NCCN Recommendations  \nTumor location is the most important variable in determining the choice of \nprimary treatment for patients with conventional or chondroid chordomas. \nDedifferentiated and poorly differentiated chordomas are usually managed \nas described in the NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma . \nWide excision with or without  adjuvant  RT is the primary treatment option \nfor patients with resectable conventional or chondroid chordomas of the \nsacrum and mobile spine.146,147 Intralesional excision with or without  \nadjuvant  RT (followed by contrast -enhanced  MRI to assess the adequacy \nof resection) is the treatment of choice for patients with resectable skull \nbase/clival tumors of conventional or chondroid histology. Maximal safe \nexcision is recommended when appropriate.156 Adjuvant treatment with RT \ncan be considered for large extra- compartmental tumors or for positive \nsurgical margins following resection. Postoperative RT has been associated with improved local control and DFS following surgery with \nmacroscopic surgical margins or intralesional excision.\n164,166,171,210,211 \nRe-excision , if necessary, can be considered for skull base tumors with \npositive surgical margins.  \nDefinitive RT is the primary treatment option for patients with unresectable \nchordomas, irrespective of the location of the tumor.  \nSurveillance  \nSurveillance consists of a physical exam, imaging ( ie, x-ray, MRI with or \nwithout contrast  ± CT with contrast ) of the primary  site (timing and \nmodality as clinically indicated) for up to 10 years , and chest imaging \n(every 6 months for 5 years and annually thereafter; may include CT \nannually; chest CT may be done with or without contrast as clinically \nindicated).  Relapsed Disease  \nChordomas are characterized by a high rate of local recurrence , and \ndistant metastases to lungs, bone, soft tissue, lymph nodes, liver, and skin \nhave been reported in up to 40% of patients with local recurrence.149,175,212-\n214 Among patients with recurrent chordomas of skull base and spine, \nFagundes and colleagues  reported a higher 2 -year actuarial OS rate for \npatients treated with subtotal resection than those who received supportive care only (63% and 21%, respectively; P =  .001).\n175 However, \nsome studies have reported that surgery and RT are associated with lower local control rates for recurrent tumors than for primary tumors in patients \nwith sacral chordomas.\n177,193 A study of 25 patients demonstrated effective \nlocal control and low acute toxicity with carbon ion RT in patients with recurrent skull base chordoma or chondrosarcoma.\n128 \nPatients with recurrent disease can be treated with surgery and/or RT215 \nand/or systemic therapy. The guidelines include imatinib (with or without \ncisplatin or sirolimus ), dasatinib,  sunitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib (for patients \nwith EGFR- positive disease) , and sorafenib as systemic therapy options \nfor patients with recurrent tumors. CGP with a validated and/or \nFDA-approved assay should be considered for  patients with recurrent \nchordoma  to determine targeted therapy opportunities.  See Molecular \nTesting and Additional Treatment Options  below.  \nEwing Sarcoma  \nEwing sarcoma is characterized by the fusion of the EWS  gene ( EWSR1 ) \non chromosome 22q12 with various members of the ETS gene family \n(FLI1, ERG , ETV1 , ETV4, and FEV).11,12 The EWS R1::FLI1 fusion \ntranscript resulting from the fusion of EWS R1 and FLI1 on chromosome \n11 and the corresponding chromosomal translocation, t(11;22)(q24;q12) , \nis identified in about 85% of patients with Ewing  sarcoma.11,14 In 5% to \n10% of cases, EWS R1 is fused with other members of the ETS gene \nfamily.

Periosteal reaction is classic and it is referred to as \n“onion skin” by radiologists.  \nPatients with Ewing sarcoma, as with most patients with bone sarcomas, \nseek attention because of localized pain or swelling. Unlike other bone \nsarcomas, constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and \nfatigue are occasionally noted at presentation. Abnormal laboratory \nstudie s may include elevated serum LDH and leukocytosis.  Prognostic Factors  \nThe important indicators of favorable prognosis include a \ndistal/peripheral site of primary disease, tumor volume <100 mL, normal \nLDH level at presentation, and the absence of metastatic disease at the \ntime of presentation.224- 231 Ewing sarcoma in the spine and sacrum is \nassociated with significantly worse outcome and prognosis than primary Ewing sarcoma in other sites.\n232 In a systematic review, Bosma and \ncolleagues also reported tumor size (diameter >8 cm) and histologic response to initial systemic treatment (≥90% necrosis) to be important \nprognostic variables.\n233 Nevertheless, m etastatic disease at presentation \nis the most significant adverse prognostic factor observed in those with \nEwing sarcoma, as it is for other bone sarcomas.30,228,234 The l ungs, \nbone, and bone marrow are the most common sites of metastasis. In a \nretrospective analysis of 975 patients from the EICESS Study Group, \n5-year relapse -free survival  (RFS) was 22% for patients with metastatic \ndisease at diagnosis compared with 55% for patients without metastases at diagnosis.\n30 Among patients with metastases, there was a trend for \nbetter survival for those with lung metastases compared to those with \nbone metastases or a combination of lung and bone metastases.30,235 \nMetastases to uncommon sites (ie, brain, liver, spleen) were associated \nwith a worse prognosis in a retrospective study of 30 patients.236 Poor \nhistologic /radiologic  response to chemotherapy has also been identified \nas an adverse prognostic factor in patients with localized non -metastatic \ndisease ,227,231,237,238 even when chemotherapy was followed by complete \n(R0) resection.239 \nThe results of the Intergroup Ewing’s Sarcoma Study ( IESS)  analyzing \nthe clinicopathologic features of 303 cases of Ewing  sarcoma showed \nthat patients  with primary tumors in pelvic bones have lower survival \nrates compared with patients with lesions in distal bones of the \nextremities.240 In an analysis of 53 patients (24 adult and 29 pediatric) \nwith Ewing  sarcoma treated with chemotherapy, Gupta and colleagues  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

This should include CT of the \nchest  with or without contrast as clinically indicated (non -contrast CT is \nrecommended for restaging) ; contrast -enhanced; MRI with or without CT  \nof the primary site; whole body FDG -PET/CT (preferred)  and/or bone \nscan; and possibly bone marrow biopsy and/or screening MRI  with or \nwithout contrast  of the spine and pelvis. In a systematic review and \nmeta -analysis, Treglia and colleagues  reported that the combination of \nFDG -PET/CT with conventional imaging is a valuable tool for the staging \nand restaging of Ewing sar coma , with 96% sensitivity and 92% \nspecificity.243 Another systematic review indicated that FDG -PET without \nbone marrow biopsy may be considered for staging in newly diagnosed \nEwing sarcoma patients, as FDG -PET demonstrated 100% sensitivity \nand 96% specificity based on pooled patient data from four studies .244 \nResults from ACRIN 6660, a multicenter prospective cohort  study  \nconducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN)  comparing whole -body MRI and conventional imaging in \npediatric patients with common malignant tumors (including Ewing \nsarcoma),  found that the noninferior accuracy for diagnosis of distant \nmetastasis was not established for the use of whole -body MRI compared \nwith conventional imaging.\n245 However, the accuracy of whole -body MRI \nwas higher for patients with solid tumors compared to those with \nlymphomas ( P = .006).  Cytogenetic and/or molecular studies of the biopsy specimen should be \nperformed to evaluate t(11;22) , or other less common translocations.  \nCGP has also been used to identify potentially actionable translocations \nin patients with sarcoma.246,247 In the case that pathologic workup of \ntargeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence in situ \nhybridization (FISH), or cytogenetics is negative, CGP or other fusion \npanels for Ewing sarcoma should be considered to identify translocations, including atypical translocations.  \nPreliminary reports suggest that EWS R1::FLI1 translocation is \nassociated with a better prognosis than other variants.\n248- 250 However, \nreports from the EURO -EWING 99 study and the Children’s Oncology \nGroup study suggest that with currently available effective therapies, \npatients with Ewing  sarcoma have similar outcomes, regardless of fusion \nsubtype in contrast to previous reports.251,252 In addition to EWS R1, FUS \nshould be considered as a fusion gene partner in the molecular \ndiagnosis to identify the rare cases of Ewing sarcoma with FUS::ERG  or \nFUS::FEV fusion transcripts.216,217 Since serum LDH has been shown to \nhave prognostic value as a tumor marker, the guidelines have included this test as part of initial evaluation.

Multiagent chemotherapy for at least 9 \nweeks is recommended prior to surgery to downstage the tumor and \nincrease the probability of achieving a complete resection with \nmicroscopically negative margins (R0).  Data supports the use of \nadjuvant chemotherapy following surgical resection, resulting in  \nimproved  RFS and OS.253- 257 Surgical resection with or without RT is \nused for local control following chemotherapy.   \nThe addition of ifosfamide, alone or in combination with etoposide to \nstandard chemotherapy, was evaluated in patients with newly diagnosed, \nnon-metastatic Ewing sarcoma.255,258- 262 In the Pediatric Oncology \nGroup -Children’s Cancer Group (POG -CCG) study (INT -0091), 398 \npatients with non- metastatic Ewing sarcoma were randomized to receive \nchemotherapy with VAC D (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, \nand doxorubicin) alone or VAC D alternating with ifosfamide and \netoposide (VAC D-IE) for a total of 17 cycles.255 The 5-year EFS rate was \nsignificantly higher in the VAC D-IE group than in the VAC D alone group \n(69% and 54%, respectively; P = .005). The 5- year OS rate was also \nsignificantly better among patients in the VAC D-IE group (72% and 61%, \nrespectively; P = .01). VACD-IE also was associated with lower \nincidences of local failure (11%) compared with VAC D (30%) irrespective \nof the type of local control therapy; 5- year cumulative incidences of local \nfailure were 30% in the VAC D arm compared with 11% in the VAC D-IE \narm.263 \nWhile dose escalation of alkylating agents in the VDC -IE regimen did not \nimprove the outcome for patients with localized disease,264 \nchemotherapy intensification through interval compression improved outcome in patients with localized disease.\n265 In a randomized trial for \npatients <50 years with localized Ewing sarcoma (n = 568), Womer and colleagues reported that VDC -IE given on an every -2-week schedule \nwas found to be more effective than VDC -IE given on an every -3-week schedule, with no increase in toxicity; median 5- year EFS was 73% and \n65%, respectively.\n265  \nThe E URO  EWING  2012 (EE2012) was a randomized analysis \nconducted to compare the induction and consolidation regimens for \nnewly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma in both the United States and \nEurope.266 Six hundred forty patients between the ages of two and 49 \nyears were randomized to two treatment arms. Treatment arm A received the European regimen: VIDE (vincristine, ifosfamide, \ndoxorubicin, and etoposide) induction therapy followed by  vincristine, \nactinomycin D, with ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide, or busulfan and melphalan consolidation.  Treatment arm B received the U.S. regimen: \ncompressed VDC/IE induction followed by vincristine and cyclophosphamide (VC) , or vincristine, actinomycin D, and ifosfamide, \nwith busulfan and melphalan consolidation. The primary endpoint of the \nstudy was event -free survival (EFS) while the secondary endpoints were \nOS and toxicity.  Event -free survival at 3 years was 61% and 67% for \ntreatment arm A and B, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·71 \n[95% credible interval 0·55- 0·92 in favor of treatment arm A ). Grade 3- 5 \nfebrile neutropenia occurred in 74% of participants in treatment arm A \nand in 58% of participants in treatment arm B. More participants in \ntreatment arm A required at least one platelet transfusion, however, \nmore participants in treatment arm B required more blood transfusions.  \nThe VDC/IE regimen proved superior to the European regimen in terms of EFS and OS with similar toxicity profiles . \nIESS- I and IESS- II showed that RT plus adjuvant chemotherapy with \nVACD was superior to VAC  in patients with localized non -metastatic \ndisease.\n254 The 5 -year relapse- free survival (RFS) rates were 60% and \n24% for VACD and VAC, respectively ( P < .001). The corresponding OS \nrates were 65% and 28% ( P < .001).  \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-18 In the INT -0091 study, which included 120 patients with metastatic \ndisease, there was no significant difference in the EFS and OS rates \nbetween the VACD -IE and VACD regimens.255 The 5 -year EFS rate was \n22% for both regimens and the 5 -year OS rate was 34% and 35% for the \nVACD -IE and VACD groups, respectively. In a study of 68 patients (44 \npatients with locoregional disease and 24 patients with distant metastases), Kolb and colleagues reported 4 -year EFS and OS rates of \n82% and 89%, respectively, for patients with locoregional disease treated with intensive chemotherapy (doxorubicin and vincristine with or \nwithout high- dose cyclophosphamide) followed by ifosfamide and \netoposide.\n260 In patients with distant metastases the corresponding \nsurvival rates were 12% and 18%, respectively. Miser and colleagues \nalso reported similar findings in patients with Ewing sarcoma with \nmetastases at diagnosis.267 \nThe EICESS -92 study investigated whether cyclophosphamide has \nefficacy similar to ifosfamide in patients with standard -risk Ewing \nsarcoma (small localized tumors) and whether the addition of etoposide \nto a regimen already containing ifosfamide improves survival in patients \nwith high -risk disease (large tumors or metastatic disease at \ndiagnosis).268 Patients with standard -risk disease were randomly \nassigned to VAI D (vincristine, dactinomycin, ifosfamide, and doxorubicin; \nn = 76) followed by either VAI D or VAC D (n = 79).268 The 3 -year EFS \nrates were 73% and 74%, respectively, for VAC D and VAI D, suggesting \nthat cyclophosphamide has the same efficacy as ifosfamide in this group \nof patients . Patients with high -risk disease were randomly assigned to \nVAID or VAI D plus etoposide (EVAI D). The 3 -year EFS rate was not \nsignificantly different between the two treatment groups ( 52% and 47%, \nrespectively, for EVAI D and VAI D).268 \nAs a follow- up to the EICESS -92 study, the Euro- EWING99 -R1 trial \nevaluated cyclophosphamide as a replacement for ifosfamide as part of consolidation therapy that also included vincristine and dactinomycin (VAC vs. VAI) after VIDE induction chemotherapy in 856 patients with \nstandard- risk Ewing sarcoma. VAC was statistically not inferior to VAI, \nbut was associated with a slight increase in events (-2.8% decrease in \n3-year EFS). The proportion of patients experiencing severe hematologic \ntoxicity was slightly h igher in the VAC arm, but renal tubular function \nimpairment was more significant for patients receiving VAI.\n269 \nHigh -Dose Therapy Followed by  Hematopoietic  Cell Transplant  \nHigh -dose therapy followed by hematopoietic cell transplant (HDT/ HCT) \nhas been evaluated in patients with localized as well as metastatic \ndisease. HDT/ HCT has been associated with potential survival benefit in \npatients with non- metastatic disease.270,271 However, studies that have \nevaluated HDT/ HCT in patients with primary metastatic disease have \nshown conflicting results.272- 278   \nThe EURO -EWING 99 study was the first large randomized trial \ndesigned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiagent induction chemotherapy with six courses of VIDE, local treatment (surgery and/or \nRT), and HDT/ HCT in 281 patients with Ewing  sarcoma with primary \ndisseminated disease.\n273 After a median follow -up of 3.8 years, the EFS \nand OS rates at 3 years for the entire study cohort were 27% and 34%, \nrespectively.277 The EFS rates were 57% and 25%, respectively, for \npatients with complete and partial response after HDT/ HCT. Patients’ \nage, tumor volume, and extent of metastatic spread were identified as \nrelevant risk factors. The outcome of patients with and without HDT/ HCT \nwas not performed because of the bias introduced early in the \nnon-transplant group (82% of patients without HDT/ HCT died after a \nmedian time of 1 year) . \nThe EURO -EWING 99 and Ewing -2008 randomized trial asked whether \nconsolidation high -dose chemotherapy improved survival in patients with \nlocalized Ewing sarcoma.278 Two hundred forty patients at high risk were PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

Patients treated with BuMel had greater improvement in 3- year \nEFS (69.0% vs. 56.7%) and 8 -year EFS (60.7% vs. 47.1%)  compared to \nVAI-treated patients. There were three treatment -related deaths: two due \nto BuMel toxicity and one due to VAI toxicity. More patients experienced severe acute toxicities related to the BuMel versus the VAI course.   \nLocal Control Therapy  \nSurgery and RT are the local control treatment modalities used for \npatients with localized disease , but no randomized  trials have compared \nthese approaches head -to-head . \nIn patients with localized Ewing  sarcoma treated in cooperative \nintergroup studies there was no significant effect of local control modality (surgery, RT, or surgery plus RT) on OS or EFS rates.\n263,279 In the CESS \n86 trial, although radical surgery and resection plus RT resulted in better \nlocal control rates (100% and 95%, respectively) than definitive RT \n(86%), there was no improvement in RFS or OS because of higher \nfrequency of metastases after surger y.279 In the INT- 0091 study, the \nincidences of local failure were similar for patients treated with surgery or \nRT alone (25%), but surgery plus RT resulted in lower incidences of local \nfailure (10.5%).263 The 5 -year EFS rate was also not significantly \ndifferent between the groups (42%, 52%, and 47% for patients treated \nwith surgery, RT, and surgery plus RT, respectively).   \nData from other retrospective analyses suggest that surgery (with or without postoperative RT) affords better local control than RT alone in \npatients with localized disease.\n280,281 The combined analysis of 1058 \npatients treated in the CESS 81, CESS 86, and EICESS 92 trials showed \nthat the rate of local failure was significantly lower after surgery (with or without postoperative RT) than after definitive RT (7.5% vs. 26.3%, \nrespectively;  P = .001), whereas the local control rate with preoperative \nRT was comparable to that of the surgery group (5.3%).280 A \nretrospective analysis of sequential studies (INT -0091, INT -0154, or \nAEWS0031) performed by the Children’s Oncology Group also \ndemonstrated that definitive RT was associated with a higher risk of local \nfailure than surgery plus RT  at 25.0% and 6.3%, respectively, but there \nwas no effect on distant failure.  282  \nDefinitive RT could be an effective treatment option for patients with \ntumors in anatomical locations not amenable to achieve surgery with \nwider resection margins.283,284 In a retrospective analysis of patients with \nEwing  sarcoma of vertebrae treated in the CESS 81/86 and EICESS 92 \nstudies, definitive RT resulted in a local control rate of 22.6%, which was \ncomparable to those of other tumor sites treated with definitive RT; EFS \nand OS at 5 years were 47% and 58%, respectively.283 Tumor size and \nRT dose have been shown to be predictive of local control rates in patients with non- metastatic Ewing  sarcoma treated with chemotherapy \nand definitive RT.\n285,286 Local control therapy has also been associated \nwith improved outcomes in patients with primary metastatic disease.287-\n289 In the EURO -EWING 99 trial, the 3 -year EFS was significantly lower \nin patients with primary metastatic disease who did not receive any local \ncontrol therapy compared to those treated with local therapy for primary \ntumor.287 Retrospective analysis of 198 patients from EURO -EWING 99 \nshowed no improvement of 5- year EFS associated with adjuvant RT in \nthe setting of completely resected disease of the chest wall.290 \nNCCN Recommendations  \nAll patients with Ewing sarcoma  should be treated with the following \nprotocol: primary treatment followed by local control therapy and adjuvant treatment.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-20 Longer duration could be considered for patients with metastatic disease \nbased on response. V DC/IE is the preferred regimen for patients with \nlocalized disease and is a category 1 recommendation.  See Bone Cancer \nSystemic Therapy Agents  in the algorithm for a list of other chemotherapy \nregimens that are recommended for patients with localized and metastatic disease.  Of note, patients with other primary round cell sarcoma of bone \ncan be treated like Ewing sarcoma.  \nDisease should be restaged with imaging following primary treatment. \nChest imaging  (specifically non- contrast CT) is recommended for \nrestaging. Additionally, primary site imaging should include contrast -\nenhanced MRI with or without CT  and plain radiograph. Head- to-toe FDG -\nPET/CT or bone scan can be used for restaging depending on the imaging \ntechnique that was used in the initial workup.   \nPatients with stable or improved disease after primary treatment should \nbe treated with local control therapy. Local control options include wide \nexcision , definitive RT with chemotherapy, or amputation in selected \ncases.\n280,283,285,287 The choice of local control therapy should be \nindividualized and is dependent on tumor location, size, response to \nchemotherapy, patient age, anticipated morbidity, and patient \npreference.263 \nAdjuvant chemotherapy following wide excision or amputation is \nrecommended for all patients regardless of surgical margins. The Panel \nstrongly recommends that the duration of chemotherapy following wide \nexcision  or amputation  should be between 28 and 49 weeks depending \non the type of regimen and the dosing schedule (category 1).253- 255 The \naddition of postoperative RT to chemotherapy is recommended for \npatients with positive or very close surgical margins.280 Denbo and \ncolleagues  reported that in patients with smaller tumor size (<8 cm) and \nnegative margins, postoperative RT can be omitted without any \ndecrement in OS.291 The 15- year estimated OS for patients who received adjuvant RT was 80% compared to 100% for those who did not. The guidelines have included adjuvant chemotherapy alone for patients \ntreated with wide excision and negative margins.  \nIn the setting of widely metastatic disease, palliative therapies may be considered. For metastatic disease that may be amenable to local \ntherapy, local control modalities, in the form of wide excision or definitive \nRT with adjuvant chemotherapy, are recom mended. Regardless of \npostoperative margin status, chemotherapy for at least 28 to 49 weeks is to be administered (category 1).  RT, in addition to chemotherapy, may \nbe considered for positive surgical margins. Following adjuvant treatment, metastases may be managed according to the location. In the \ncase of oligometastatic disease, excision or RT is recommended. \nStereotactic radios urgery (SRS)/stereotactic body RT (SBRT) can be \nconsidered, especially for oligometastases.\n292- 294 For pulmonary \nmetastases, dependent on the response, resection and/or whole lung \nirradiation (WLI) may be considered.295 Based on the EORTC -SIOP \nphase III study published in 1988, which concluded there to be no \nsurvival benefit of WLI over adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with \nosteosarcoma, a systematic review of both prophylactic as well as \ncurative WLI in patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma was \nconducted.296,297 Only two studies compared the results of chemotherapy \nalone and chemotherapy and curative WLI in patients with metastatic \nEwing sarcoma. In both trials, patients experienced some benefit with \nWLI and chemotherapy when compared to chemotherapy alone. For instance, in the EICESS -92 trial, patients who also received WLI showed \na 12% improvement in 5- year OS.\n297,298 Ultimately, it was concluded that \nthe decision to use WLI should be based on the patient’s risk of \npulmonary metastases and any coexisting respiratory diseases.297 \nProgressive disease following primary treatment is best managed with RT and/or surgery to primary site followed by chemotherapy or best \nsupportive care.

Chest imaging (x -ray or CT) is recommended every 3 months . \nHead- to-toe FDG -PET/ CT or bone scan can be considered as \nappropriate. Surveillance intervals should be increased after 2 years. \nLong- term surveillance should be performed annually after 5 years , and \nas clinically indicated (indefinitely) (category 2B).299  \nRelapsed or Refractory Disease  \nApproximately  30% to 40% of patients with localized Ewing sarcoma at \npresentation and 60% to 80% with metastatic disease at presentation \nexperience recurrence (local and/or distant) and have a very poor \nprognosis.300 Patients with a longer time to first recurrence have a better \nchance of survival following recurrence. Late relapse ( ≥2 years from the \ntime of original diagnosis ), lung -only metastases, local recurrence that \ncan be treated with radical surgery, and intensive chemotherapy are the most favorable prognostic factors, whereas early relapse ( <2 years from \nthe time of original diagnosis ) with metastases in lungs and/or other \nsites, recurrence at local and distant sites, elevated LDH at initial \ndiagnosis, and init ial recurrence are considered adverse prognostic \nfactors.\n301- 304 In a retrospective analysis, site of first relapse and time to \nfirst relapse were significant prognostic factors for adult patients with \nlocalized Ewing  sarcoma.305 The probability of 5 -year post -relapse \nsurvival was 5 5% and 22%, respectively, for patients with local and \ndistant relapse. The probability of 5 -year post -relapse survival was also \nsignificantly higher for patients with late relapse than for those with early relapse.\n30,300,305 Overall, it is reported that close to 70% of relapses are \nearly relapses, of which two- thirds occur at distant sites (in the lungs \nand/or bones). Patients who initially presented with widespread disease \nare more likely to relapse at distant sites, whereas those individuals who presented with localized disease are more likely to develop local \nrelapse.306  \nTopoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in combination with cyclophosphamide and temozolomide have been associated with \nfavorable response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory bone \nsarcomas.\n307- 313 In a series of 54 patients with relapsed or refractory \nEwing  sarcoma, cyclophosphamide and topotecan induced responses in \n44% of patients (35% of patients had a complete response and 9% had a \npartial response).308 After a median follow -up of 23 months, 26% of \npatients were in continuous remission. In a retrospective analysis of \npatients with recurrent or progressive Ewing  sarcoma, irinotecan and \ntemozolomide resulted in an overall objective response rate  of 63%. The \nmedian time to progression (TTP) for all the evaluable patients (n = 20) \nwas 8.3 months (16.2 months for the subset of patients with recurrent \ndisease).311 Patients who were in a 2- year first remission and those with \nprimary localized disease had better median TTP compared to those who \nrelapsed within 2 years from diagnosis and patients with metastatic \ndisease at diagnosis.   \nCombination therapy with vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide also \nappears to be active and well -tolerated in patients with relapsed or \nrefractory Ewing  sarcoma, with an overall response rate (ORR) of \n68%.314 A review of 107 patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing  \nsarcoma examined the combination of etoposide with a platinum agent (ie, cisplatin or carboplatin), suggesting that further study of etoposide  \nand carboplatin may be warranted.\n315 HDT/ HCT has been associated \nwith improved long- term survival in patients with relapsed or progressive \nEwing  sarcoma in small, single -institution studies.316- 318 The role of this \napproach is yet to be determined in prospective randomized studies.  \nThe CABONE trial, a multicenter, single -arm phase 2 trial, evaluated the \nactivity of cabozantinib in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-22 osteosarcoma.319 Currently approved for renal carcinoma, hepatocellular \ncarcinoma, and medullary thyroid cancer, cabozantinib is a vascular \nendothelial growth factor receptor -2 (VEGFR2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor \nwith inhibitory activity against the MET receptor. For Ewing  sarcoma, the \nprimary endpoint in this study was a 6- month objective response, while \nthe secondary endpoints included safety, 6 -month non -progression, best \noverall response, 1- year and 2 -year PFS and OS, and metabolic \nresponse (evaluated by FDG -PET/CT 28 days after the first dose). The \nprimary endpoint was achieved with a 6 -month objective response of \n26% (95% CI, 13 –42) among 39 patients with Ewing sarcoma. \nAdditionally, the median OS was reported to be 10.2 months with a \nmedian PFS of 4.4 months. OS was noted to be 84% at 6 months, 48% \nat 12 months, and finally 14% at 24 months. Forty two percent (95% CI, \n25–61) of patients exhibited a metabolic tumor response. Cabozantinib \nwas well -tolerated among patients with the most common grade 3 or 4 \nadverse effects  being hypophosphatemia, elevated aspartate \naminotransferase (AST), palmar -plantar syndrome, pneumothorax, and \nneutropenia.319  \nThe efficacy of regorafenib has been evaluated in the phase II SARC024 \ntrial in 30 patients with metastatic Ewing sarcoma whose disease \nprogressed following at least 1 line of therapy. The 8 -week progression-\nfree rate was 63% and the median OS was 53 weeks .320  \nThe phase III rEECur trial compared the efficacy of high- dose ifosfamide \n(IFOS) (n = 73) against topotecan and cyclophosphamide (TC) (n = 73) in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma.\n321 The median \nEFS was 3.7 months and 5.7 months for TC and IFOS, respectively, and \nthe median OS was 10.4 months and 16.8 months for TC and IFOS, \nrespectively. Greater survival for EFS and OS was also seen in \nindividuals aged <14 years.   A retrospective study evaluated docetaxel in combination with gemcitabine in 22 children and young adults with refractory bone \nsarcomas .\n322 The m edian duration of response  was 4.8 months  and the \nobjective response rate was  29%. \nThe combination of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide has also been \nevaluated  in three Children’s Cancer Group phase I/II trials  in 97 patients \nwith relapsed or refractory bone sarcomas .323 The ORR was 51%.   \nA single -arm phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of \nlurbinectedin in a cohort of 28 adult patients with relapsed Ewing \nsarcoma.324 Treatment with lurbinectedin resulted in an ORR of 14.3% \nand a median duration of response of 4.2 months.  \nIn a study evaluating 26 patients treated for local recurrence of Ewing sarcoma, surgical treatment was associated with better survival ( P < \n.001).\n325 In addition to chemotherapy, surgery may be a treatment option \nfor some patients who experience relapsed disease.  \nNCCN Recommendations  \nTreatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory disease include \nparticipation in a clinical trial and chemotherapy  (with or without RT  or with \nor without surgery ). See Bone Cancer Systemic Therapy Agents  in the \nalgorithm for a list of other  systemic therapy  regimens recommended for \npatients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma .  \nAll patients with recurrent and metastatic disease should be considered for \nclinical trials investiga ting new treatment approaches.  \n  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-23 Giant Cell Tumor of Bone  \nGCTB is a rare benign primary tumor of the bone accounting for about 3% \nto 5% of all primary bone tumors, with a strong tendency for local \nrecurrence and that may metastasize to the lungs.326,327 GCTB usually \noccurs between 20 and 40 years of age. The meta -epiphyseal regions of \nthe distal femur and proximal tibia are the most common primary sites.328 \nMalignant transformation to high- grade osteosarcoma has been observed \nin rare cases and is associated with a poor prognosis.329,330  \nWorkup  \nInitial workup should include H&P  examination with imaging ( eg, x-ray, \nMRI with and without  contrast ± CT) of the primary site as clinically \nindicated, in addition to chest imaging.  CT is useful to define the extent of \ncortical destruction, whereas MRI is the preferred imaging modality to \nassess the extension of tumors into the adjacent soft tissue and \nneurovascular structures.331,332 Chest imaging is essential to identify the \npresence of metastatic disease.  Bone scan can be considered for unusual \ncases. Biopsy is essential to confirm the diagnosis. Brown tumor of \nhyperparathyroidism should be considered as a differential diagnosis ; \nroutine evaluation of serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone \nlevels can help exclude this diagnosis.333 If there is malignant \ntransformation, treat as osteosarcoma.  \nTreatment  \nSurgery  \nWide excision and intralesional curettage are the two surgical treatment \noptions for patients with resectable tumors.334-340 Wide excision is \nassociated with a lower risk of local recurrence than intralesional \ncurettage, with the local recurrence rates ranging from 0% to 12% for wide \nexcision and 12% to 65% for intralesional curettage. In some studies, the \nextent of intralesional excision and the tumor stage have been identified \nas prognostic indicators for risk of recurrence.341-343 Blackley and colleagues  reported a local recurrence rate of 12% in 59 patients who \nwere treated with curettage with high- speed burr and bone grafting, which \nwas similar to that observed with the use of adjuvants; the majority of the \npatients had grade II or III tumors.342 In another retrospective analysis of \n137 patients, Prosser and coll eagues  reported local recurrences in 19% of \npatients following curettage as a primary treatment; local recurrence rate \nwas only 7% for patients with grade I and II tumors confined to the bone \ncompared with 29% for those with grade III tumors with extraosseous \nextension.343  \nSurgical adjuvants have been used in conjunction with intralesional \ncurettage to improve local control rates. However, the findings from \nstudies that have evaluated intralesional curettage, with and without \nadjuvant in the same cohort of patients with prim ary or recurrent GCTB, \nare inconsistent, with some reporting decreased local recurrence rates with the use of adjuvants.\n338,344 -347 Others, however, have reported no \nsignificant difference in local recurrence rates with and without adjuvants.\n150,348,349  \nWide excision is also associated with poor functional outcome and greater \nsurgical complications.350-355 Therefore, intralesional curettage is \nconsidered the treatment of choice in a majority of patients with stage I or II tumors. Wide excision is usually reserved for more aggressive stage III \ntumors with extraosseous extension or otherwise unresectable \ntumo rs.\n343,356- 359 \nRadiation Therapy  \nRT has been used either as a primary treatment or in combination with \nsurgery to improve local control and DFS for patients with marginally \nresected, unresectable, progressive, or recurrent disease.360-371 In a \nretrospective analysis of 58 patients with GCTB (45 patients with primary tumor and 13 patients with recurrent tumor) treated with RT, the 5- year \nlocal control and OS rates were 85% and 94%, respectively.\n370 Median PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-24 follow- up was 8 years. In this analysis, patient age was the only prognostic \nfactor with local control rates (96% for patients ≤30.8 years  vs. 73% for  \npatients >30.8 years ) as well as OS (100% vs. 87%) and DFS rates (96% \nvs. 65%). Other studies have identified tumor size > 4 cm, recurrent \ntumors, and RT doses of ≤ 40 Gy as negative prognostic factors for local \ncontrol.366-368,371    \nSpecialized techniques such as 3D -CRT and IMRT have also been \nassociated with good local control rates in patients with GCTB in locations \nthat are not amenable to complete surgical resection.372,373 \nAdverse side effects have occurred as a result of RT. As GCTB is a \nbenign growth, radiation use should be considered riskier  than for \nmalignant tumors. 374,375 Therefore, the P anel recommends that RT should \nbe considered if no other treatment options are available, if possible.  \nSystemic Therapy  \nDenosumab (a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against the RANK ligand) has demonstrated activity in patients with unresectable or recurrent \nGCTB.\n376-383 In June 2013, denosumab was approved by the FDA for the \ntreatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with GCTB that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe \nmorbidity . It is a preferred option in resectable localized disease with \nunacceptable morbidity and/or with unresectable axial lesions, or unresectable metastatic disease at presentation . \nSeveral phase II trials have examined the efficacy of denosumab for \ntreating primary and recurrent GCTB. In an open -label, phase II study (n =  \n37), denosumab induced tumor response (defined as the elimination of ≥90% of giant cells or no radiologic progression of the target lesion for ≤25 \nweeks) in 86% (30 of 35 evaluable patients) of patients with unresectable or recurrent GCTB.\n376 An open- label, parallel -group, phase II study divided \npatients with GCTB  into three cohorts: those with unresectable GCTB (cohort 1), those with resectable GCTB associated with severe surgical morbidity (cohort 2), and those transferred from a previous study of \ndenosumab for GCTB (cohort 3).\n378,384,385 After a median follow -up of 58.1 \nmonths,  TTP or recurrence in 253 patients in cohort 1 had not been \nreached.385 Clinically significant reductions in pain were reported by over \nhalf of the study patients within 2 months.386 Final analysis of outcomes \nfrom cohort 2 (n = 222) showed that denosumab enabled 48% of patients \nto delay/avoid surgery and 38% to undergo less morbid resections.  \nThe risk of local recurrence has been reported to be higher when \ndenosumab is used prior to curettage.  In a retrospective analysis of 408 \npatients treated for GCTB using either intralesional curettage or wide \nexcision, the local recurrence rate for patients treated with curettage and \ndenosumab was 60%, compared to 16% for those individuals treated with curettage alone.\n387 Additionally, the joint preservation rate  of patients \ntreated with curettage and denosumab was 80% compared to 94% for \nthose treated with curettage alone.  Although denosumab usage was \nreported to be the only independent factor associated with increased \nrecurrence, it is likely that such an association may also stem from \nselection bias .387 Use of denosumab before surgery , however,  may aid in \ndefining a peripheral rim around the tumor.388,389 \nPhase II trial data have also suggested that sequential FDG -PET imaging \nappears to be a sensitive tool for early detection of tumor response to denosumab treatment.\n390  \nThere have been reports of increased risk of developing osteosarcoma \nassociated with denosumab therapy  in recurrent GCTB.391-393 The data are \nlimited to determine the cause of the increased risk, but the NCCN Panel \nidentifies some possibilities, such as spontaneous conversion to a secondary sarcoma, or a diagnostic and/or sampling error that erroneously \ncategorizes a tumor as GCTB.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-25 In prior versions of the guidelines, interferon (IFN) was recommended as a \ntreatment  option, based on case reports that reported the efficacy of IFN in \nthe management of GCTB .394- 397 However, since IFN is no longer available \nin the United States, it  is no longer included as a treatment  option in the \nguidelines . \nNCCN Recommendations  \nLocalized Disease  \nIntralesional excision with an effective adjuvant may be an  adequate \nprimary treatment for resectable tumors.150,348,349  \nSerial arterial embolizations have been shown to be effective in the \ncomprehensive care of patients with giant cell tumors of the extremities, \nespecially for tumors with large cortical defects or joint involvement and for those with large giant cell tumors of the sacrum.\n398-401  \nFor patients with lesions that are resectable with unacceptable morbidity and/or unresectable axial lesions, the guidelines have included \ndenosumab and/or serial embolization as preferred options.  Consultation \nwith a dentist should be considered prior to initiating denosumab \ntherapy.\n402,403 RT is another recommended option, although it may be \nassociated with an increased risk of malignant transformation.  Imaging \nshould be used to assess treatment response and should include plain \nradiographs as well as contrast -enhanced  CT with or without MRI.  \nFollowing primary treatment, patients with stable/improved disease can be \nobserved. For patients with stable/improved disease with incomplete \nhealing following primary treatment, excision is recommended if the lesion \nhas become resectable.  Long- term denosumab use may be associated \nwith increased risk of local recurrence.  Patients whose disease remains unresectable should be retreated with \ndenosumab, serial embolization, and/or RT . Denosumab may be \ncontinued until disease progression, in responding disease.  \nMetastatic Disease  \nFor patients presenting with resectable metastases, the guidelines \nrecommend that primary tumor be managed as described above for \nlocalized disease.326,327,404,405 Intralesional excision may also be used  for \nresectable metastatic sites. Denosumab (preferred) , observation, and RT \nare options for patients with unresectable metastases.  \nSurveillance and Recurrence  \nSurveillance should include a physical exam, imaging ( eg, x-ray, contrast -\nenhanced CT and/or  MRI) of the surgical  site as clinically indicated, and \nchest imaging. As the average time to metastasis ranges from \napproximately 2 to 4 years,404-406 chest imaging should be performed every \n6 to 12  months for 4 years , then annually thereafter , as clinically indicated .  \nRecurrent disease (local or metastatic) should be managed as per primary \ntreatment for localized disease or metastatic disease at presentation. For \npatients with local recurrence and resectable disease, chest imaging and \ndenosumab can be considered prior to surgery. However, the risk of local \nrecurrence is increased when denosumab is used prior to curettage. \nDenosumab may be beneficial to define peripheral tumor extent when \nplanning wide resection.  \nOsteosarcoma  \nOsteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in \nchildren and young adults. With bimodal age distribution, incidences first \npeak among patients aged 10 to 14 years, and again in patients >65 years.\n407. In adults >65 years, osteosarcoma may develop as a \nsecondary malignancy related to Paget disease of the bone.19 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-26 Osteosarcoma is broadly classified into three histologic subtypes \n(intramedullary, surface, and extraskeletal).408  \nHigh -grade intramedullary osteosarcoma is the classic or conventional \nform, comprising nearly 80% of osteosarcoma s.408 It is a spindle cell or \npleomorphic tumor that produces osteoid or immature bone. The most \nfrequent sites include  the metaphys is of the distal femur or proximal tibia, \nwhich correspond to the physes  of maximum growth  in normal skeletal \ndevelopment . Low -grade intramedullary osteosarcoma comprise < 2% of \nall osteosarcomas ; the most common sites are similar to that of \nconventional osteosarcoma.409 \nParosteal and periosteal osteosarcomas are juxtacortical or surface \nvariants. Parosteal osteosarcomas are low -grade lesions accounting for \nup to 5% of all osteosarcomas.409 The most common site is the posterior \ndistal femur. This variant is associated with very low metastatic potential.  \nTransformation of low -grade parosteal osteosarcoma into high- grade \nosteo sarcoma has been documented in 24% to 43% of cases.410,411 \nPeriosteal osteosarcomas are intermediate -grade lesions , showing \npartial cartilaginous differentiation, and most often involv e the femur , \nfollowed by the tibia.409 High -grade surface osteosarcomas are very rare, \naccounting for 10% of all juxtacortical osteosarcomas.412,413 \nPain and swelling are the most frequent early symptoms. Pain is often \nintermittent in the beginning and a thorough workup sometimes is \ndelayed because symptoms may be confused with growing pains  or \nconfounded by musculoskeletal injury . Osteosarcoma spreads \nhematogenously, with the lung being the most common metastatic site , \nthough “skip lesions” in the same bone can also occur . \nFor treating extraskeletal osteosarcomas, please see the NCCN \nGuidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma .   Prognostic Factors  \nTumor site and size, patient age, presence and location of metastases, histologic response to chemotherapy, and type of surgery and surgical \nmargins are significant prognostic factors for patients with osteosarcoma \nof the  extremities and trunk.\n414- 422 A meta- analysis and systematic review \nof 18,126 participants showed that patient sex, tumor site (extremity versus non -extremity), tumor size, response to chemotherapy, and \nsurgery (amputation versus salvage) were identified as prognostic factors in osteosarcoma.\n 423 In patients with extremity osteosarcomas, in \naddition to these variables, size and location within the limb at the time of diagnosis also had significant influence on outcome.\n423 All factors except \nage were significant in multivariate testing, with surgical remission and histologic response to chemotherapy emerging as the key prognostic \nfactors. In a meta -analysis of data from prospective neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy trials in 4838 patients with osteosarcoma, female sex was associated with increased chemotherapy -induced tumor necrosis and \ngreater OS, and children had better outcomes than adolescents and adults.\n424 In a report of the combined analysis of three  European \nOsteosarcoma Intergroup randomized controlled trials, Whelan and \ncolleagues  reported that good histologic response to preoperative \nchemotherapy, distal location (other than proximal humerus/femur), and female gender were associated with improved survival.\n419 However, high \nbody mass index (BMI) in patients with osteosarcoma was associated with lower OS compared with patients with normal BMI.\n425    \nIn patients with proven primary metastatic osteosarcoma, the number of \nmetastases at diagnosis and the completeness of surgical resection of all \nclinically detected tumor sites are of independent prognostic value.31 \nPatients with one or a few resectable pulmonary metastases have a survival rate that approaches that of patients without  metastatic \ndisease.\n426,427 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-27 Elevated serum ALP and LDH levels have also been identified as \nprognostic indicators in patients with osteosarcoma.415,417,418,428,429 In a \ncohort of 1421 patients with osteosarcoma of the extremity, Bacci and \ncolleagues  reported significantly higher serum LDH levels in patients with \nmetastatic disease at presentation than in patients with localized disease (36.6% vs. 18.8%; P < .0001).\n417 The 5 -year DFS correlated with serum \nLDH levels (39.5% for patients with high LDH levels and 60% for those \nwith normal values). In another retrospective analysis of 789 patients \nwith osteosarcoma of the extremity, it was  reported that serum ALP level \nwas a significant prognostic factor of EFS in patients with osteosarcoma \nof the extremity; the 5 -year EFS rate was 24% for patients with a serum \nALP value of more than four  times higher than the normal value and 46% \nfor patients with high values below this lim it (P < .001).418 However, in \nmultivariate analys es, these markers did not retain their prognostic \nsignificance when compared to tumor volume, age, and histologic \nresponse to chemotherapy.415,417 \nWorkup  \nOsteosarcomas  present both a local control problem and a concern for \ndistant metastasis. Initial workup should include imaging of the primary \nsite ( contrast -enhanced MRI with or without CT), chest imaging  including \nchest CT,  and head -to-toe FDG -PET/CT and/or bone scan. More \ndetailed imaging (MRI  with and without contrast or CT ) of skeletal \nmetastatic sites to identify  abnormalities identified on primary imaging is \nrequired for suspected metastatic disease.  \nPlain  x-rays of osteosarcomas show cortical destruction and irregular \nreactive bone formation. Bone scan, while uniformly abnormal at the \nlesion, may be useful to identify additional synchronous lesions. MRI \nprovides excellent soft  tissue contrast and may be essential for operative \nplanning. MRI is the best imaging modality to define the extent of the lesion within the bone as well as within the soft tissues, to detect “skip” metastases and to evaluate anatomic relationships with the surrounding \nstructures. In addition , ALP and LDH are frequently elevated in patients \nwith osteosarcoma. Serum LDH was significantly higher in patients with metastatic disease at presentation than in patients with localized \ndisease.\n417   \nGiven that osteosarcoma is most common among children and AYAs, \nthe effect of cancer and its treatment on fertility must be discussed with \npatients. Fertility preservation methods and alternatives should be \ndiscussed with patients as appropriate. See the Diagnostic Workup \nsection above.    \nFinally, a number of genetic aberrations may underly osteosarcoma.430 For \ninstance, it is reported that nearly 70% of patients with osteosarcoma may \nexhibit mutations in the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma gene, RB1 .430 \nGenetic cancer syndromes that exhibit a predisposition for osteosarcoma include: Li -Fraumeni syndrome, hereditary retinoblastoma, \nRothmund -Thomson syndrome type 2, Bloom syndrome, Werner \nsyndrome, RAPADILINO syndrome, and Diamond- Blackfan anemia. Thus, \nthe NCCN Panel recommends that genetic consultation and testing be \nconsidered for patients diagnosed with chondrosarcoma or osteosarcoma \nwho possess a family or personal history of bone sarcomas.\n21 \nTreatment  \nSurgery  \nSurgery (limb -sparing surgery or amputation) remains an essential part of \ncomprehensive care for patients with osteosarcoma.431 Studies that have \ncompared limb- sparing surgery and amputation in patients with \nhigh- grade, non- metastatic osteosarcoma have not shown any significant \ndifference in survival and local recurrence rates between these \nprocedures.432-434 However, limb -sparing surgery is associated with better \nfunctional outcomes.435 In patients with high- grade osteosarcomas with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.

MAP is preferred in patients <40 years with excellent \nperformance status. In the event a patient receiving high -dose \nmethotrexate experiences delayed elimination due to renal impairment, \nglucarpidase is strongly recommended.  \nIn a randomized trial conducted by the European Osteosarcoma Group, \nthe combination of doxorubicin and cisplatin was better tolerated \ncompared to a multi -drug regimen with no difference in survival between \nthe groups in patients with operable, non -metastatic osteosarcoma.445 \nThe 3 -year and 5 -year OS rates were 65% and 55%, respectively, in \nboth groups. The 5 -year PFS rate was 44% in both groups. In the \nINT-0133 study, which compared the 3 -drug regimen (cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate) with the 4- drug regimen (cisplatin, \ndoxorubicin, methotrexate, and ifosfamide) for the treatment of patients \nwith non -metastatic resectable osteosarcoma, there was no difference in \nthe 6- year EFS (63% and 64%, respectively) and OS (74% and 70%, \nrespectively) between the two groups.451 \nChemotherapy regimens without doxorubicin or cisplatin have also been \nevaluated in patients with localized osteosarcoma with the aim of \nminimizing long -term cardiotoxicity and ototoxicity.454,455 In a randomized \nmulticenter trial (SFOP -OS94), the combination of ifosfamide and \netoposide resulted in a higher histologic response rate than the regimen \ncontaining high- dose methotrexate and doxorubicin (56% and 39%, \nrespectively). However, the 5 -year OS was similar in both arms and \nthere was no significant difference in 5- year EFS rates.455   \nGood histopathologic response ( >90% necrosis) to neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy is associated with improved survival regardless of the \ntype of chemotherapy administered after surgery.299,456,457 In an analysis \nof 881 patients with non- metastatic osteosarcoma of the extremities \ntreated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery at the Rizzoli \nOrthopaedic Institute, Bacci and colleagues  showed that the 5 -year DFS \nand OS correlated significantly with histologic response to chemotherapy.\n458 The 5 -year DFS and OS in patients with good and poor  \nresponse  to chemotherapy were 67.9% v ersus 51.3% ( P < .0001) and \n78.4% v ersus 63.7% ( P < .0001), respectively. A report from the \nChildren ’s Oncology Group also confirmed these findings; the 8- year \npostoperative EFS and OS rates were 81% and 87%, respectively, in \npatients with good  response.456 The corresponding survival rates were \n46% and 52%, respectively, in patients with poorly responding disease. \nFor individuals with poorly responding disease, completion of \nchemotherapy is still warranted, as outcomes are still better than those \nwho do not complete chemotherapy.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nBone Cancer  \n \nMS-29 NCCN Recommendations  \nLocalized Disease  \nThe guidelines recommend wide excision as the primary treatment for \npatients with low -grade (intramedullary and surface) osteosarcomas and \nperiosteal lesions. If pathologic high- grade disease is discovered after \nwide excision, adjuvant chemotherapy is a category 1 recommendation.   \nLong- term results (>25 years of follow -up) from patients with high- grade, \nlocalized osteosarcoma reveal significant benefits of adjuvant \nchemotherapy on DFS and OS.457 Chemotherapy prior to wide excision \ncould be considered for patients with periosteal lesions. Although \nchemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) has been used in the treatment \nof patients with periosteal osteosarcoma, there are no data to support \nthat the addition of chemotherapy to wide excision improves outcome in \npatients with periosteal osteosarco ma.459- 461  In a review of 119 patients \nwith periosteal sarcoma published by the European Musculo- Skeletal \nOncology Society, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not a \nprognostic factor, although it was used in the majority of the patients.460 \nCesari and colleagues  also reported similar findings; the 10 -year OS rate \nwas 86% and 83%, respectively, for patients who received adjuvant \nchemotherapy with surgery and for those who underwent surgery alone \n(P = .73).459 A systematic review of 13 studies, including 291 patients \nwith periosteal osteosarcoma, found no statistically significant \nimprovement in mortality rates among those who received surgery and \n(neo-) adjuvant chemotherapy and those who received surgery alone . 461 \nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to wide excision is preferred for those \nwith high -grade osteosarcoma (category 1).426,444- 446,449 -451,454,455,462 \nRepeat imaging using pretreatment imaging modalities should be used to \nreassess the tumor for resectability. Selected older  patients may benefit \nfrom immediate surgery.  Following wide excision, patients whose disease has a good histologic response (amount of viable tumor is < 10% of the tumor area) should \ncontinue to receive several more cycles of the same chemotherapy. \nSurgical re- excision  with or without RT can be considered for positive \nsurgical margins. In a study of 119 patients with osteosarcoma of the head and neck, combined modality treatment with surgery and RT (vs . \nsurgery alone) improved local control and OS for patients with positive or uncertain surgical margins.\n463 Combined photon/proton or proton beam \nRT has been shown to be effective for local control in some patients with unresectable or incompletely resected osteosarcoma.\n464,465 \nPatients whose disease has a poor response (viable tumor is ≥10% of the tumor area) can continue with the preoperative regimen or be \nconsidered for chemotherapy with a different regimen (category 3).  \nHowever, attempts to improve the outcome of those with poor respon se \nby modifying the adjuvant chemotherapy remain unsuccessful .\n452,466- 469  \nIn individuals whose sarcoma remains unresectable following \npreoperative chemotherapy, RT or adjuvant chemotherapy is \nrecommended. A  randomized phase III trial of the European and \nAmerican Osteosarcoma Study ( EURAMOS ) Group evaluated treatment \nstrategies for resectable osteosarcoma based on histologic response to \npreoperative chemotherapy .466,470 The EURAMOS -1 trial included \ncohorts that received maintenance therapy with MAP; MAP with \nIFN-α-2b therapy ; or MAP with ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE). T he \naddition of maintenance IFN -α-2b therapy to MAP in the adjuvant setting \ndid not improve outcomes for individuals whose disease had a good \nresponse  to preoperative chemotherapy.470 However, the authors note \nthat a significant portion of patients assigned to  the IFN arm (n = 357) did \nnot receive the intended dose of IFN -α-2b due to patient declination  to \ninitiate therapy  (n=86; 24%)  or premature termination of therapy  (n=105; \n39%) .

Additional treatment options for \npatients whose disease has positive margins and poor response may \ninclude additional local therapy such as re -excision with or without RT.  \nMetastatic Disease at Presentation  \nApproximately 10% to 20% of patients present with metastatic disease at \ndiagnosis.31,471,472 The number of metastases at diagnosis and complete \nsurgical resection of all clinically detected tumor sites are of independent prognostic value in patients with primary metastatic disease at \npresentation.\n31 Unilateral metastases and lower number of lung nodules \nwere associated with improved outcomes with chemotherapy in patients with synchronous lung metastases.\n426,427 The 2 -year DFS rate was \nsignificantly higher for patients with only one or two metastatic lesions than for patients with three  or more lesions (78% and 28%, \nrespectively).\n426  \nAlthough chemotherapy is associated with improved outcomes in patients with non- metastatic, high- grade, localized osteosarcoma, the \nresults were significantly poorer in patients with metastatic disease at presentation.\n471,473- 475 In a study of 57 patients with metastatic disease at \npresentation treated with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and a high dose of \nmethotrexate and ifosfamide, the 2- year EFS and OS rates were 21% \nand 55%, respectively, compared to 75% and 94% in patients with non-metastatic disease at presentation, treated with the same \nchemotherapy protocol.474 High -dose ifosfamide plus etoposide was \nexamined in a phase II/III trial of 43 patients with newly  diagnosed \nmetastatic osteosarcoma, revealing an ORR of 59% ± 8%, but \nconsiderable toxicity.476  \nAmong patients with primary metastases treated in cooperative osteosarcoma trials, long -term survival rates were higher for patients \nwhose metastases were excised following chemotherapy and surgery of the primary tumor compared to those patients whose metastases could \nnot be removed (48% and 5%, respectively).\n477 The combination of \naggressive chemotherapy with simultaneous resection of primary and metastatic lesions has also resulted in improved outcomes in patients \nwith osteosarcoma of the extremity with lung metastases at \npresentation.\n478 \nFor patients with resectable metastases (pulmonary, visceral, or skeletal) \nat presentation, the guidelines recommend preoperative chemotherapy \nfollowed by wide excision of the primary tumor.  Chemotherapy , \nmetastasectomy, and SRT  are included as options for the management \nof resectable metastatic disease. In the event that pulmonary \nmetastasectomy is not feasible, ablation procedures may be considered. A retrospective review of 83 patients with high -grade osteosarcoma and \nwidespread metastases who underwent complete resection of the primary tumor and surgical removal of all detectable metastases followed \nby chemotherapy analyzed tumor characteristics, treatment regimens, \nand their impact on survival. \n479 Nine (10.8%) patients had an initial \ncomplete remission, of which one patient remained 12.7 years later. Sixty -three of the remaining 74 patients died secondary to their disease, \nand 2 died from other causes. Actuarial EFS and OS after  5 years was \n1.4 ± 1.4%, and 8.7 ± 3.3% , respectively .

Patients who presented with pleural effus ion and metastasis \nat distant bones also had poorer outcomes   \nIn a study conducted by UCLA, 16 patients (who had received either \nprior chemotherapy or surgery) with lung metastases from high -grade \nsarcomas were treated with SBRT.293 In total, 25 lesions were identified \nand treated with a median SBRT dose of 54 Gy (range 36– 54 Gy) in 3 to \n4 fractions.293 Overall survival at 4 years was reported to be 78%.293 In \nanother study, 30 patients with sarcoma with pulmonary metastases \nreceived SBRT at a median dose of 50 Gy in 4 to 5 fractions.292 Patients \nhad received prior chemotherapy, surgery, or thoracic RT. Local control \nat 12 and 24 months was reported to be 94% and 86%, respectively, \nwhile OS was 76% and 43%.292 These reports suggest that SBRT may \nprove to be a promising alternative to surgery for oligometastatic disease. Unresectable metastatic disease should be managed with \nchemotherapy and/or RT followed by reassessment of the primary site \nfor local control.   \nSurveillance  \nOnce treatment  is completed, surveillance  should occur every 3 months \nfor years  1 and 2,  then every 4 months for year 3 , then every 6 months \nfor years 4 and 5, and annually thereafter , as clinically indicated . \nSurveillance should include a complete physical  exam and imaging of \nthe primary site and chest  as performed during initial disease workup . \nHead- to-toe FDG -PET/CT and/or bone scan (category 2B) may also be \nconsidered. Functional reassessment should be performed at every visit. CBC and other laboratory studies can be performed as clinically \nindicated.   Relapsed or Refractory Disease  \nApproximately  30% to 40%  of patients with localized disease  and 80% of \npatients presenting with metastatic disease will relapse.\n480,481 The \npresence of solitary metastases, time to first relapse, and complete resectability of the disease at first recurrence have been reported to be \nthe most important prognostic indicators for improved survival, whereas \npatients not amenable to surgery and those with a second or third \nrecurrence have a poor prognosis.\n480- 485 In patients with primary \nnon-metastatic osteosarcoma, a longer relapse -free interval to \npulmonary metastases was significantly associated with better survival.\n484 The prognostic significance of surgical clearance among \npatients with second and subsequent recurrences was also confirmed in \na report of survival estimates derived from large cohorts of unselected \npatients treated at the COSS group trials.486 \nThe combination of etoposide with cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide has \nbeen evaluated in clinical trials.487- 489 In a phase II trial  of the French \nSociety of Pediatric Oncology, high -dose ifosfamide and etoposide \nresulted in a response rate of 48% in patients with relapsed or refractory \nosteosarcoma.488 In another phase II trial, cyclophosphamide and \netoposide resulted in a 19% response rate and 35% rate of stable \ndisease in patients with relapsed high- risk osteosarcoma.487 PFS at 4 \nmonths was 42%.  \nIn a non -comparative, double -blind, placebo- controlled, phase II trial \n(REGOBONE), the efficacy and safety of regorafenib, a multikinase \ninhibitor, was evaluated among patients with progressive metastatic \nosteosarcoma (who underwent 1 –2 previous lines of c hemotherapy and \nhad a performance status of ECOG 0 –1).490 It was found that 65% of \npatients in the regorafenib arm exhibited non- progressive disease at 8 \nweeks compared to no patients in the placebo arm.

The most \ncommonly noted adverse effects associated with regorafenib included \nhypertension and hand- foot skin reaction. It was concluded that \nregorafenib displayed antitumor activity in progressive met astatic \nosteosarcoma, delaying disease progression. Similarly, in another \nrandomized, double- blind phase II study (SARC024), the activity of \nregorafenib was again evaluated in patients with progressive metastatic osteosarcoma.\n491 The study met its primary endpoint with a median PFS \nof 3.6 months in the regorafenib arm versus 1.7 months in the placebo \narm (CI, 0.21– 0.85; P = .017; hazard ratio [HR], 0.42). The NCCN Panel \nhas included regorafenib under second -line therapy for osteosarcoma \n(relapsed, refractory, or metastatic disease) with a category 1 \nrecommendation.  \nSimilar to its activity in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma, cabozantinib, as aforementioned, also exhibited activity in patients with \nadvanced osteosarcoma. In the CABONE trial, the primary endpoint for \npatients with osteosarcoma included 6 -month obje ctive response as well \nas 6-month non -progression.\n319 Secondary endpoints included safety, \nbest overall response, 1 -year and 2 -year PFS and OS, and metabolic \nresponse (evaluated by FDG -PET/CT 28 days after the first dose). \nSimilar to that of Ewing sarcoma, the primary endpoints for patients with \nosteosarcoma were reached as 12% of patients showed an objective \nresponse and 33% were progression -free at 6 months. Seventeen \npercent of patients exhibited partial response and 62% of patients \nshowed stable disease as their best overall response. Of those with \nstable  disease, 33% of individuals displayed tumor shrinkage. \nCabozantinib has thus been included in the guideline as a second -line \ntreatment option for patients with relapsed, refractory, or metastatic \nosteosarcoma.  Single -agent gemcitabine and combination regimens such as docetaxel \nand gemcitabine;  cyclophosphamide and topotecan; high -dose \nmethotrexate with or without etoposide and ifosfamide; or ifosfamide, \ncarboplatin, and etoposide have also been effective in the treatment of \npatients with relapsed or refractory bone sarcomas.310,322,323,455,492- 496  \nRadium 223 dichloride is an alpha- emitting, bone -targeting \nradiopharmaceutical, and was studied in a phase I trial in 18 patients \nwith recurrent or metastatic osteosarcoma. 497 A metabolic response was \nobserved in 1 patient, while mixed responses were observed in 4 patients. A response in brain metastases was observed in 1 patient. The \nmedian OS time was 25 weeks.  \nSamarium -153 ethylene  diamine tetramethylene phosphonate ( Sm-\n153-EDTMP ) is a beta- particle –emitting , bone -seeking \nradiopharmaceutical that was previously recommended as a second -line \ntreatment option in the guidelines based on data in patients with locally \nrecurrent or metastatic\n osteosarcoma or skeletal metastases.498,499 \nHowever, NCCN no longer recommends Sm -153-EDTMP in the \nguidelines as it is no longer available in the United States.  \nTargeted inhibition of a variety of molecular pathways such as mTOR, \nSRC family of kinases, and VEGFRs are being evaluated in clinical trials \nto improve outcomes in patients with relapsed or refractory \nosteosarcoma. In a phase II trial of the Italian Sarcoma Group (n = 30), \nsorafenib (VEGFR inhibitor) demonstrated activity in patients with \nrelapsed and unresectable high -grade osteosarcoma after progression of \ndisease on  standard multimodal therapy.500 The PFS at four  months \n(primary endpoint) was 46%. Median PFS and OS were four  months and \nseven  months, respectively. The CBR (defined as no progression at 6 \nmonths) was 29%.

Sorafenib is a preferred second -line therapy option for \nosteosarcoma in the guidelines.  \nTo extend the duration of activity, a study examined sorafenib combined \nwith everolimus for patients with unresectable or relapsed high- grade \nosteosarcoma (n = 38).501 Data suggested that this regimen is active in \nthe second -line setting, but toxicity required dose reductions and/or \ntreatment interruptions in 66% of patients. Therefore, under second- line \noptions for patients with osteosarcoma, sorafenib in combination with \neverolimus is categorized under  “Other Recommended Regimens ” \n(category 2B recommendation).  \nThe safety and efficacy of HDT/ HCT in patients with locally advanced, \nmetastatic, or relapsed osteosarcoma have  also been evaluated.502,503 In \nthe Italian Sarcoma Group study, treatment with carboplatin and \netoposide was followed by stem cell rescue, combined with \nsurgery -induced complete response in chemosensitive disease.503 \nTransplant -related mortality was 3.1%. The 3 -year OS and DFS rates \nwere 20% and 12%, respectively. The efficacy of this approach in \npatients with high- risk disease is yet to be determined in prospective \nrandomized studies.  \nThe optimal treatment strategy for patients with relapsed or refractory \ndisease has yet to be defined. If relapse occurs, the patient should receive \nsecond- line chemotherapy and/or surgical resection when feasible, \nfollowed by imaging to assess treatment response. See the Bone Cancer \nSystemic Therapy Agents  in the algorithm  for a complete list of \nsecond- line chemotherapy regimens.  Surveillance is recommended for \npatients with disease that responds  to second- line therapy.  \nPatients with disease progression or relapse after second- line therapy \ncould be treat ed with resection, RT504 (that may include radiopharmaceuticals, including radium -223), or best supportive care.  \nParticipation in a clinical trial is  strongly encouraged.  \nHigh- Grade Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma of \nBone   \nHigh-grade UPS of the bone most frequently arises in the appendicular \nskeleton and is associated with both a high rate of local recurrence and \nlocal nodal and distal metastases.505 The addition of chemotherapy to \nsurgery has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with \nnon-metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH).506-508 In the \nEuropean Osteosarcoma Intergroup study, adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cisplatin resulted in good pathologic \nresponse rates and survival (quite comparable with those for \nosteosarcoma) in patients with non -metastatic MFH.\n508 Median survival \ntime was 63 months, and the 5- year PFS and OS rates were 56% and \n59%, respectively. The guidelines recommend that patients with \nhigh- grade UPS of bone should be treat ed with regimens listed for \nosteosarcoma  (category 2B) .  \nMolecular Testing and Additional Treatment Options \nComprehensive Genomic Profiling  \nCGP  is defined as next -generation –based molecular assays that provide \ngenomic information about tumors and mechanism of disease to facilitate \nclinical decision -making.509 Due to the availability of new targeted \ntherapies, patients with bone cancer may benefit from CGP .  \nIn a single- center chart review study of 102 patients with advanced \nsarcoma (including 11% with osteosarcoma, 4% with chondrosarcoma, \n3% with chordoma, and 3%  with Ewing sarcoma), 93% had at least one \ngenomic alteration and 61% had a potentially actionable alteration based \non CGP.

The ORR was 30.8% and the median duration of response was 47.5 months.  \nKEYNOTE- 158 also evaluated whether TMB status was associated with \noutcomes in patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors who \nwere treated with pembrolizumab.\n512 Patients were evaluated for tissue \nTMB  (tTMB) status by NGS and those with TMB -H status (defined as ≥10 \nmutations/megabase) exhibited clinical improvement with an ORR of 29% \ncompared to 6% among the non– tTMB -H group.  512  \nPD-1 inhibitor  nivolumab  in combination with CTLA -4 inhibitor ipilimumab  \nwas evaluated in CheckMate 848, a randomized, open- label , phase II \nstudy in  patients with advanced or metastatic solid TMB -H tumors .513 The \nORR rate with nivolumab/ipilimumab was 35.3% for those with tTMB -H in \nan interim analysis , and 22.5% in those with high blood TMB  (bTMB -H) in \na final analysis .  Based on these data, Guidelines state that testing for TMB and MMR/MSI \nas determined by a validated and/or FDA -approved assay can be \nconsidered for select patients with metastatic chondrosarcoma, recurrent \nchordoma, metastatic Ewing sarcoma, or unresectabl e metastatic \nosteosarcoma.  \nPembrolizumab and nivolumab/ipilimumab are recommended as options \nunder Useful in Certain Circumstances for those with unresectable or \nmetastatic TMB -H (≥10 mutations/megabase) tumors whose disease \nprogressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Pembrolizumab is also included as a \npreferred treatment option for patients with unresectable or metastatic TMB -H (≥10 mutations/megabase) whose disease progressed following \nprior treatment and who have no satisfactor y alternative treatment options.  \nThe Panel does not recommend pembrolizumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab \nas treatment options for GCTB, which is not technically a malignant tumor.  \nOther molecular -guided therapy options included in the guidelines are \nivosidenib for chondrosarcoma with susceptible IDH1 mutations \n127 and \nlapatinib for EGFR -positive chordomas.206,514  \nSummary  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Bone Cancer provide recommendations for the \ntreatment of chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, chordoma, Ewing \nsarcoma, and GCTB. Depending on  the subtype, recommended \ntreatment modalities for bone cancer may include surgery, RT, and \nsystemic therapy. Evaluation  by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in \nthe management of bone cancer is highly recommended prior to initiation \nof therapy to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate \ntreatments . The NCCN Guidelines for Bone Cancer will continue to be \nupdated at least once a year by the NCCN Bone Cancer Panel based on consensus and clinical evidence.   \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:27:22 PM.
