When CD34 is negative, other markers such as S100 \nshould also be negative to rule out other spindle cell tumors.\n• For equivocal lesions, consider fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or conventional cytogenetics  to \ndetect t(17;22)(q22;q13), which is a hallmark of DFSP. Fusion of the collagen type I alpha 1 gene ( COL1A1) at 17q22, with the platelet-derived \ngrowth factor Beta gene (PDGFβ ) at 22q13, form the oncogenic chimeric fusion gene COL1A1::PDGFβ. \n• Margin control during excision ( see Principles of Surgery [DFSP-B]) may occasionally be aided by H&E sections supplemented by CD34 \nimmunohistochemistry.\n1 Currently, no American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) or College of American Pathologists (CAP) synoptic reporting is defined.\n2 If areas of transformation to fibrosarcoma or other sarcoma subtypes are identified, multidisciplinary consultation for consideration of further treatment and surveillance \nis recommended.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nDermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans  \n \nMS-2 \n \nOverview \nDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is an uncommon, low -grade \nsarcoma of fibroblast origin with an incidence rate of 4. 1 to 4.5 cases \nper million persons per year in the United States.1-4 A predilection for \noccurring in African Americans has been reported in one study.3 Initial \nmisdiagnosis, prolonged time to accurate diagnosis, and large tumor \nsize at the time of diagnosis are common.  However, DFSP  rarely \nmetastasizes.5 When metastasis occurs, it is typically in the lung, bone, \nor regional lymph nodes. Three -dimensional reconstruction of DFSP6 \nhas revealed tumors with highly irregular shapes and frequent \nfinger -like extensions.7 As a result, incomplete removal and subsequent \nrecurrence are common without attention to full assessment of the \nperipheral and deep margin. The local recurrence rate for  wide local \nexcision (WLE) of  DFSP in studies ranges from 10% to 60%, whereas \nthe rate of development of regional or distant metastatic disease is only \n1% and 4- 7.4%, respectively.8,9  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update \nMethodology  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice \nGuidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Dermatofibrosarcoma  \nProtuberans , an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain key literature using  the following search term: \ndermatofibrosarcoma  protuberans . The PubMed database was chosen \nas it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and \nindexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.10  The search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article \ntypes: Clinical Trial; Guideline; Meta- Analysis; Practice Guideline; \nRandomized Controlled Trial; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines as discussed by the \npanel during the Guidelines update have been included in this version \nof the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high- level \nevidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of lower -level \nevidence and expert opinion. \n \nSensitive/Inclusive Language \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation.\n11 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to \nuse language that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -\nclassist, anti -misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight biased; \nand inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender \nidentities.  NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, \ninstead focusing on organ- specific recommendations. This language is \nboth more accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the \nneeds of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identit ies. \nNCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from \norganizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies \ndo not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these \nterms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate \ngender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is \npresumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nDermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans  \n \nMS-3 \n \nand organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their \nfuture analyses.  \nEvaluation \nHistologically, DFSP typically presents as a storiform or fascicular \nproliferation of bland spindled cells that extends from the dermis into the \nsubcutis.12,13 Virtually all cases are CD34 -positive and factor XIIIa-\nnegative with rare exceptions.14,15 Currently, no synoptic reporting is \nrecommended. Preliminary workup for DFSP consists of history and \nphysical (H&P) examination, and biopsy. It should be noted that this \ntumor is frequently misdiagnosed due to inadequate tissue sampling \nresulting from shallow biopsy. As the superficial aspect of a DFSP may not be distinct from  benign lesions , a punch or incisional biopsy that \nsamples the subcutaneous layer  is strongly recommended. If a biopsy is \nindeterminate or clinical suspicion remains, rebiopsy is recommended.  \nIn most cases, examination of hematoxylin and eosin- stained \nspecimens by light microscopy results in an unequivocal diagnosis. \nHowever, differentiation of DFSP from dermatofibroma can be difficult at \ntimes. Staining with CD34,\n15,16 factor XIIIa ,14,17  and other  \nimmunomarkers such as stromelysins 3,  nestin, apolipoprotein D, and \ncathepsin K ,18-21 might be useful  in such instances . The NCCN Panel \nrecommends that appropriate and confirmatory immunostaining be \nperformed in all cases of suspected DFSP.   \nIt is unclear whether the histologic features of a high mitotic rate or \nevidence of fibrosarcomatous  (FS-DFSP ) change have prognostic \nsignificance in DFSP.22,23 Studies in the biomedical literature both \nsupport24-32 the connection between FS -DFSP and an increased risk of \nlocal recurrence, lower time to recurrence, and increased risk of \nmetastasis,  and refute33,34 this notion.  A systematic review of 225 \npatients with FS -DFSP and 1422with DFSP   reported risks of local recurrence (29.8% vs. 13.7%), metastasis (14.4% vs. 1.1%), and death \n(14.7% vs. 0.8%) from the disease to be significantly higher in FS -\nDFSP.35 Overall, FS-DFSP is associated with a metastatic risk range of \n10 - 23.5%.23,26,36 The NCCN Panel recommends that  the debulking \nspecimens from all excisions should be examined to identify  \nfibrosarcomatous (FS) transformation of DFSP . If FS transformation  or \nother sarcoma subtypes  are found, multidisciplinary consultation for \nconsideration of further treatment and surveillance is recommended. \nClinicians should consult the NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma  \nfor multimodal therapy and surveillance considerations including CT of \ndraining nodal basin and chest .  \nAfter DFSP confirmation , additional  workup may include a complete \nskin examination as well as consideration of preoperative MRI with contrast for treatment planning if there is suspicion of extensive \nsubcutaneous extension. As  decisions about diagnosis and resection \nmay be complex, multidisciplinary consultation at a center with \nspecialized expertise should be strongly considered, especially for large \nor recurrent DFSP as it may optimize clinical and reconstructive \noutcomes.\n37,38 \nTreatment  \nInitial treatment of DFSP is surgical. Because of its proclivity for \nirregular and frequently deep subclinical extensions, every effort should \nbe made to completely remove this tumor at the time of initial therapy. \nExcision with Mohs micrographic surgery (Mohs) or other forms of \nperipheral and deep en face margin assessment (PDEMA) is \nrecommended over WLE. En face sectioning is preferred to prevent \nmissing small foci of tumor. The most commonly used form of PDEMA \nis Mohs (Refer to NCCN Guidelines for Squamous Cell Skin Cancer  – \nPrinciples of PDEMA Technique).39 When anatomic structures at the \ndeep margin (eg, major vessels, nerves, bone) preclude complete PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:36:22 PM.

A combination of PDEMA and WLE for the deep margin has been reported in the literature.\n38 Treatment \nconsiderations for non- visualized areas may be the subject  of \nmultidisciplinary discussion. If PDEMA is unavailable, WLE can be considered. Wide undermining is discouraged prior to confirmation of \nclear margins due to the difficulty of interpreting subsequent re- excised \nmargins, and the risk of concealing residual tumor below mobilized tissue. Additionally, tumor mutation analysis and neoadjuvant imatinib \ncan be considered options for unresectable or borderline resectable \ndisease. Consider neoadj uvant imatinib for patients in whom DFSP \nresection with negative margins may result in unacceptable functional or \ncosmetic outcomes .\n40 The NCCN Panel recommends that if a negative \nmargin is achieved, no adjuvant treatment is necessary. When Mohs or \nother forms of PDEMA are used, Radiation therapy ( RT) is not \nrecommended.  \nIf initial surgery yields positive margins, re -resection is recommended \nwhenever possible, with the goal of achieving clear margins.  Mohs or \nmodified Mohs surgery, and traditional WLE with wider margins, which \nhas been associated with higher tumor clearance and lower rates of \nrecurrence,41-43 are all methods to achieve complete histologic \nassessment.  Studies examining outcomes of both Mohs and WLE have \nconsistently reported lower recurrence rates for the former (0% –6.6% \nvs. 1.7% –30.8%).44-53A large retrospective series of 204 patients with \nDFSP showed a very low local recurrence rate (1%) using WLE with total peripheral margin pathologic evaluation, underscoring the \nimportance of meticulous pathologic margin evaluation with any surgical \ntechnique.\n54 This notion was also supported by more studies.55,56 It is \nrecommended that any reconstruction involving extensive undermining \nbe avoided. Tissue rearrangement , if necessary, should be delayed until negative histologic margins are verified to prevent displacing a potentially positive margin or hampering interpretation of re -excisions . If \nthere is concern that the surgical margins are not clear  when Mohs or \nPDEMA is not available, split -thickness skin grafting should be \nconsidered to monitor for recurrence.  \nRadiation has occasionally been used as a primary therapeutic modality \nfor DFSP  along with other therapies ,\n57-59 but it is most beneficial  as \nadjuvant therapy after surgery.57-64 In a single- institution retrospective \nreview of 53 patients  with DFSP  treated with surgery and preoperative \nor postoperative RT, local control was 93% and actuarial overall survival \nwas 98% at  10 years.34 Another small patient series reported that 86% \nof patients DFSP was treated with postoperative RT remained disease-\nfree at a median follow -up of 10.5 years.63 In a systematic review and \nmeta -analysis of adjuvant RT for DFSP after WLE, the overall \nrecurrence rate was reported to be 11.74%. Patients with positive/close margins had a recurrence rate of 14.23% whereas those with negative \nmargins had no recurrence.\n65 The NCCN Panel recommends that w hen \nMohs or other forms of PDEMA are not used, RT can be considered if \nmargins are deem ed narrow by the treating physicians . RT can be \nconsidered for the treatment of positive margins if not given previously and further resection is not feasible.  \nDFSP can be treated by targeted platelet -derived growth factor receptor  \n(PDGFRs) . DFSP is characterized by a translocation between \nchromosomes 17 and 22 [t(17;22)(q22;q13)] resulting in the overexpression of PDGFR  β.\n66-68 These findings suggest that targeting \nPDGF Rs may be an effective treatment for DFSP . In published results, \nimatinib mesylate, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown clinical \nactivity against DFSP,40,69- 73 which has led to its approval by the U.S. \nFood and Drug Administration ( FDA) for the treatment of unresectable, \nrecurrent, and/or metastatic DFSP in adult patients.

Although metastatic \ndisease is rare, a guided H&P and patient education about regular self -\nexamination are recommended. Consider MRI surveillance for deeply \ninvasive disease or other concerns related to recurrence.  Recurrent tumors should be resected whenever possible. Adjuvant RT  \nmay be considered after surgery. For patients who are not surgical \ncandidates, RT alone is an option if not given previously. Imatinib \nmesylate should be considered in cases where the disease is unresectable following multiple resections, or if unacceptable functional \nor cosmetic outcomes will occur with further resection.
