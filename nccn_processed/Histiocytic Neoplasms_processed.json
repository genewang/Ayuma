Manifestations may \nalso vary by site.1,2\n• Comprehensive immunophenotyping should be performed including S100, CD1a, Langerin (CD207), CD68 and/or CD163, cyclin D1, BRAF V600E (VE1), \nfactor XIIIa, and, if indicated, ALK and fascin. Discriminatory markers for carcinoma, melanoma, lymphoma, sarcoma, and other suspected disorders are \nuseful for differential diagnoses. Cyclin D1 IHC can be helpful to distinguish LCH from reactive Langerhans cell collections and has also been reported to \nbe positive in RDD.3-5\n• ALK IHC may be considered, as ALK+ histiocytosis may carry a targetable ALK rearrangement .6,7\n• It is recommended to perform molecular mutation profiling to aid in confirmation of  a clonal Langerhans or histiocytic process and to identify potential \nprognostically relevant mutations or therapeutic targets. Correlation with clinical presentation and imaging findings is crucial for accurate diagnosis. \nTissue diagnosis should be confirmed by pathologists with expertise in site-specific histiocytic lesions (eg, hematopathology, dermatopathology, \npulmonary pathology, neuropathology) .8\n• In patients with unexplained cytopenias, bone marrow biopsy should be considered due to possible concomitant bone marrow processes, such \nas hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or myeloid neoplasia (ie, myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], myeloproliferative neoplasms [MPN], chronic \nmyelomonocytic leukemia [CMML]).9-15\n• For LCH and ECD, molecular testing for somatic mutations and fusions can be performed in a stepwise manner or in parallel, depending on clinical need \nand institutional protocols. The frequency of suspected molecular lesions should drive the order of testing if a stepwise algorithm is chosen. Allele-\nspecific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BRAF V600E (VE1) mutations can be the first step if BRAF V600E (VE1) IHC is not available or is equivocal.16 \nSomatic mutation NGS panel testing should cover the common MAPK pathway mutations. RNA-based molecular panel fusion testing should cover \nBRAF, ALK, RET, and NTRK1 rearrangements. If there is clinical concern for ALK rearrangement, or if fusion panel testing is not available, ALK IHC and \nfluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies may be performed. Repeat molecular testing in negative cases, potentially using a different tissue sample.\nLangerhans Cell Histiocytosis\n• LCH is an abnormal proliferation of Langerhans-type cells with frequent driver mutations involving the MAPK pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK).\n• Histopathologic features include cells with oval or twisted, grooved, or lobulated nuclei, finely granular chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and abundant \ncytoplasm; these cells frequently have admixed eosinophils and histiocytes, including multinucleated forms, but not usually plasma cell rich. Ki-67 is variable.\n• Langerhans cells show immunoreactivity for S100, CD1a, and Langerin (CD207).\n• Reactive Langerhans cell infiltrates may mimic LCH; by IHC, expression of cyclin D1 (BCL1) and BRAF V600E (VE1 clone) support LCH.6 VE1 staining is \nnot 100% sensitive or specific, and concurrent molecular testing is recommended.\n• Activating signaling pathway mutations found in LCH include BRAF V600E, BRAF indels, MAP2K1/2 , N/KRAS, and ARAF. Kinase fusions  \n(ie, BRAF, ALK, RET, NTRK1) and mutations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway have been reported in LCH as well.17-19 Concomitant panel testing for BRAF \nV600E (VE1) and other MAPK pathway mutations is recommended.20,21\nHIST-C\n1 OF 5ContinuedReferences on HIST-C 3 of 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:43:45 PM.

Reactive \nlymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils are also often present. T ypical histologic findings vary by site.8 For example, bone lesions may be masked by \nsignificant fibrosis, including, in some cases, storiform fibrosis. In CNS and lung, the lesional histiocytes are non-lipidized, with eosinophilic cytoplasm, \nand lack the typical inflammatory infiltrate. In skin, the typical xanthomatous histiocytes are common but can be diffuse or interstitial and relatively subtle. \nIn the retroperitoneum, findings are usually xanthomatous but sometimes extensively fibrotic, and can be associated with increased IgG4+ plasma cells \nmeeting criteria for IgG4-related disease. Finally, in cardiac tissues, diffuse infiltrates of xanthomatous histiocytes may be observed.\n• The neoplastic cells show immunoreactivities for some histiocytic markers (eg, CD68w, CD163, fascin, factor XIIIa). They are negative for CD1a and \nLangerin (CD207) and can be dim S100+.\n• Activating signaling pathway mutations found in ECD are similar to those found in LCH, though PIK3CA activating mutation is more common in ECD. \nBRAF V600E mutation has been detected in about 50% of patients with ECD. Kinase fusions (ie,  BRAF, ALK, RET, NTRK1) and CSF1R mutations have \nbeen reported rarely as well.17,19,22 The revised histiocytic classification recommends classification of all “JXG” with activating MAPK pathway mutations \n(BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1/2 ) as ECD.23,24\nRosai-Dorfman Disease\n• RDD comprises a heterogeneous group of clinical presentations that can be associated with familial, autoimmune, or malignant process. Classical \nsporadic RDD shows bilateral painless massive cervical lymphadenopathy associated with B symptoms. It is often also found in mediastinal, inguinal, and \nretroperitoneal lymph nodes. Extranodal RDD presentation is common.\n• Hallmark histopathologic features of nodal RDD include dilated sinusoidal spaces filled with large histiocytes with a round to oval hypochromatic nucleus, \nan inconspicuous to distinct nucleolus, and abundant foamy to clear cytoplasm engulfing a variable number of intact inflammatory cells—namely \nemperipolesis, a phenomenon recognized in either physiologic  or pathologic process. Large histiocytes are positive for monocyte-macrophage markers \n(ie, S100, CD68, CD163) and negative for LCH markers (ie,  CD1a, Langerin [CD207]). Cyclin D1/BCL1 IHC can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis. There are \noften increased polyclonal plasma cells, and further study is needed for confirmation of IgG4 disorder .25 Extranodal RDD shows more fibrosis and less \nfrequent emperipolesis.26\n• A subset of patients with RDD harbor gene mutations involving NRAS, KRAS, MAP2K1/2 , and rarely BRAF.22,27,28\n• Inherited conditions predisposing to RDD are typically seen in pediatric patients  but could be considered in adolescents and young adults:\n\u0017Another heterozygous germline gene mutation involving the FAS gene is TNFRSF6, which is  found in 40% of patients with RDD  who had an ALPS type Ia.\n\u0017SLC29A3  germline gene mutation leading to familial or Faisalabad histiocytosis and H syndrome (histiocytosis-lymphadenopathy plus syndrome).PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGY\nHIST-C\n2 OF 5ContinuedReferences on HIST-C 3 of 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:43:45 PM.

For patients without CNS \ninvolvement, it may be reasonable to start at half the approved dose and modify based on toxicities.\n• Some patients may be able to tolerate chronic low-dose administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, especially after attainment of best \nresponse. Dose reductions and treatment breaks are highly individualized with close monitoring for relapse.\n• ECG monitoring is recommended for patients on BRAF inhibitors as clinically indicated. \n• Cardiomyopathy may occur with MEK inhibitors. Monitoring is recommended as clinically indicated.\n• Hypersensitivity reaction may occur with administration. Monitor for and treat hypersensitivity reactions.\n• Electrolytes (eg, magnesium, potassium) should be monitored prior to and 15 days after initiation of therapy , then monthly during the first 3 \nmonths and every 3 months thereafter or as clinically indicated.\n• Liver function should be monitored prior to initiation of therapy , then monthly or as clinically indicated for potential dose modification or \ndiscontinuation.\n• Renal function should be monitored prior to initiation of therapy and as clinically indicated for potential dose modification or \ndiscontinuation.\n• Serious hemorrhagic events may occur with therapy. Evaluate risk of bleeding prior to initiation of therapy, then monitor for signs and \nsymptoms of bleeding as clinically indicated.\n• This agent may be associated with hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency . Patients \nshould be monitored for signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia, and screening for G6PD status may be warranted.\n• Pyrexia (defined as a temperature of ≥38.3 °C) is a common (~55%) side effect of combining BRAF and MEK inhibitors and occurs less \nfrequently with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (~20%).b The pyrexia is episodic, with a median duration of 9 days, and onset is often 2–4 \nweeks following the start of therapy. Pyrexia may be associated with chills, night sweats, rash, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and \nhypotension. Stopping or holding BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination at the onset of pyrexia will often interrupt the episode, and treatment \ncan be resumed with full-dose BRAF/MEK inhibitors upon cessation of pyrexia and pyrexia-related symptoms. Upon re-exposure to BRAF/ \nMEK inhibitors, repeat pyrexia events can occur, but grade >3 events are uncommon (21%). In occasional instances of prolonged or severe \npyrexia not responsive to discontinuation of BRAF/MEK inhibitors, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 10 mg/day) can be used. Patients \nwith pyrexia should be advised to use antipyretics as needed and increase fluid intake. \na Refer to full prescribing information for individual agents regarding specific and additional information ( https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf ).\nb The frequency of pyrexia and other adverse events varies between specific BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:43:45 PM.

BRAF inhibitors are associated with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, extreme \nphotosensitivity, and other dermatologic toxicities, which occur much less often with concurrent MEK inhibitors. Severe and life-threatening1 \nskin toxicity (eg, drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome) can occur with the use of BRAF inhibitors following immune checkpoint \nblockade, and requires prompt dermatologic consultation for accurate diagnosis and treatment.2 Cutaneous toxicities of MEK inhibitors \nmost commonly manifest as acneiform rash. Topical benzoyl peroxide with or without oral doxycycline/minocycline may be used at the \nonset of rash (see Management of Toxicities Associated with Targeted and Immune Therapies (ME-K) in the NCCN Guidelines for Melanoma: \nCutaneous).\n• Serious retinopathy may occur with MEK inhibitors. Monitoring by retinal exam with optical coherence tomography (OCT) is recommended.\nConsiderations for Targeted Therapies\n• Patients may not be able to tolerate the full doses of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n• It is generally reasonable to start with one or two dose reductions, and then adjust the dose based on response. See HIST-F 3 of 3 .\n• Consider drug-drug interactions that may occur with concurrent use of specific CYP  inhibitors or inducers, along with other interacting \nclasses, by avoiding the interacting drug or adjusting the dose of the targeted agent, as clinically indicated.\nReferences\n1 Maloney NJ, Rana J, Yang JJ, et al.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHistiocytic Neoplasms   \n \nMS-2 \nOverview \nHistiocytic neoplasms represent hematologic disorders characterized by \nthe accumulation of myeloid- dendritic cell -derived neoplastic cells with \nan accompanying inflammatory infiltrate.1,2 They are rare, accounting for \nless than 1% of cancers of the soft tissue and lymph nodes.2 Histiocytic \nneoplasms are also heterogeneous, and presentation varies from \nlocalized and mild to disseminated and lethal.1 Initial presentation is \noften nonspecific, which can lead to a significant delay in the diagnosis and treatment of histiocytic disorders,\n3 and these patients should ideally \nbe evaluated and treated at centers of expertise.  \nThere are over 100 subtypes of histiocytoses.1 The original \nclassification of histiocytic neoplasms by the Working Group of the \nHistiocyte Society, which was published in 1987, categorized these \ndisorders as follows: Langerhans cell, non- Langerhans cell, and \nmalignant histiocytoses.4 However, this  categorization of histiocytic \nneoplasms as Langerhans/non- Langerhans was not useful , as \nneoplasms classified as Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) were found  \nto share many of the same molecular features as those classified as \nErdheim -Chester disease (ECD), following emerging deep sequencing \ndiagnostic methods.1,2 For example, clonal mutations of genes in the \nMAPK pathway have been found in the majority of Langerhans and \nnon-Langerhans histiocytoses.5-8 Thus, i n 2016, the Histiocyte Society \npublished a revised classification based on clinical, radiographic, histologic, phenotypic, and other molecular features, further dividing \nthem into five groups of diseases: 1) Langerhans -related ; 2) cutaneous \nand mucocutaneous ; 3) malignant histiocytoses ; 4) Rosai -Dorfman \ndisease (RDD);  and 5) hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and \nmacrophage activation syndrome .\n1 \nThe NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines (NCCN Guidelines®) for \nHistiocytic Neoplasms include recommendations for  the diagnosis and treatment of adults with LCH, ECD, and RDD, which are the most commonly seen histiocytic neoplasms in adults . The evidence \nsupporting the management of histiocytic neoplasms in adults is largely based on small retrospective studies, case series, and case reports, \ndue to the paucity of prospective studies in adults. In addition, some of \nthe diagnostic and treatment  recommendations for adults with histiocytic \nneoplasms are, out of necessity, extrapolated from prospective studies \nin children and young adults, except when stated otherwise.  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org.  \nLiterature Search Criteria \nPrior to the annual update of the NCCN Guidelines® for Histiocytic \nNeoplasms , an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain key literature published since the previous update, \nusing the search terms:  (histiocyt* OR (\"Langerhans cell\") OR \n(Erdheim -Chester) OR (Rosai -Dorfman)) AND (cancer OR oncology OR \nneoplasm). The PubMed database was chosen because it remains the \nmost widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer -\nreviewed biomedical literature .9 \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article \ntypes: Clinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, \nPhase IV; Guideline; Practice Guideline; Random ized Controlled Trial; \nMeta -Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data \nfrom key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources \ndeemed relevant to these guidelines as discussed by the P anel have \nbeen included in this version of the Discussion section.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHistiocytic Neoplasms   \n \nMS-3 \nRecommendations for which high- level evidence is lacking are based \non the P anel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.10 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to \nuse language that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -\nclassist, anti -misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -\nbiased; and inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender \nidentities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, \ninstead focusing on organ- specific recommendations. This language is \nboth more accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the \nneeds of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identit ies. \nNCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from \norganizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies \ndo not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these \nterms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate \ngender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is \npresumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN \nencourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies \nand organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their \nfuture analyses .  \nCharacteristics and Diagnostic Evaluation of Histiocytic \nNeoplasms  \nCharacteristics of LCH, ECD, and RDD involve features across multiple \norgan systems, including the bone, nervous, endocrine, respiratory, \ndermatologic, and cardiac  systems, among others.3 These diverse \nclinical manifestations mimic other conditions, posing a major diagnostic \nchallenge. For a more detailed list of characteristic features of ECD, LCH, and RDD, see Characteristic Features of Histiocytic Neoplasms  in \nthe algorithm.  \nFor patients with suspected disease, a complete medical history and \nphysical (H&P) examination should be conducted  along with l aboratory  \ntests , including a complete blood count (CBC) with differential , a \ncomprehensive metabolic panel that includes liver and kidney function \nassessments , evaluation of  C-reactive protein, morning urine and serum \nosmolality, morning serum cortisol with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) , thyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH)  plus free T4 , follicle -\nstimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone  (FSH/LH)  with testosterone or \nestradiol , and prolactin and insulin- like growth factor 1. A bone marrow \naspirate/biopsy should be performed if the patient has an abnormal, \nunexplained CBC , and, if brain lesions are present but inaccessible by \nbiopsy , a lumbar puncture should also be conducted.  Subspecialty \nconsultations (eg, pulmonary and smoking cessation, neurology, \nendocrinology) should be carried out as clinically indicated. \nDermatology consultation is recommended for patients treated with \ncertain targeted therapies (ie, BRAF and MEK inhibitors) for diagnosis \nand treatment of skin- related toxicities.\n11 Retinal evaluation may be \nconsidered due to the high incidence of ser ious retinopathy with MEK \ninhibitors.12,13 See Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the algorithm \nfor a full assessment list . \nPathologic Analysis of Histiocytic Neoplasms \nImmunohistochemical (IHC) analysis plays an important role in the \ndiagnosis  of histiocytic neoplasms  and should be carried out when a \nhistiocytic neoplasm is suspected. The basic IHC panel should include CD163/CD68, S100, CD1a, L angerin/CD207, cyclin D1, and factor XIIIa \nas indicated.\n3 BRAF  V600E (VE1) IHC is recommended for LCH and \nECD.  It should be noted that negative or equivocal IHC for BRAF  \nV600E VE1 does not exclude mutated BRAF  V600E and further testing PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:43:45 PM.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)  and fascin may \nalso be included as clinically indicated to identify ALK- rearranged \nhistiocytoses.14 IHC analysis can be helpful in the broad differential \ndiagnosis of histiocytosis, including varied entities such as composite \nIgG4 -related disease and B -cell lymphoma, as well as infection, fat \nnecrosis, and idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis.3 \nNext-generation sequencing (NGS) of fresh or paraffin- embedded tumor \ntissue for identification of mutations in the RAS/RAF/MAPK/ERK and \nPI3K/AKT pathway genes can be instrumental in the diagnosis of \nhistiocytic neoplasms and can also inform systemic therapy decision-\nmaking.3 Peripheral blood may be informative of multisystem disease. \nAdditionally, fusion testing should be performed to  assess for  BRAF , \nALK, RET, and NTRK1  rearrangements . Of note, fusion testing is  \nrecommended if histiocytosis is clinically suspected and the NGS panel \ndoes not reveal BRAF  or other MAPK mutations .15 If fusion panel \ntesting is unavailable, then IHC or fluorescence in situ hybridization \n(FISH) may be used to evaluate for ALK  rearrangements. Molecular \ntesting can be done either in a stepwise fashion or in parallel, \ndepending on clinical indication and institutional protocols. If a specific \nhistiocytic disorder is suspected, then stepwise testing should be \ntailored based on the mutations known to be associated with that \ndisorder.15 Further details regarding recommendations for pathologic \nanalysis related to LCH, ECD, and RDD are included below . A complete \nlist of immunophenotypes and molecular features  to include in the \nevaluation can also be found on the Summary of Pathologic and \nMolecular Features of Histiocytic Neoplasms  pages in the algorithm.  \nLangerhans Cell Histiocytosis \nLCH is the most common histiocytic disorder  and occurs  more \nfrequently  in children than adults . The incidence of disseminated LCH  is \nestimated t o be 5 to 9 cases per 1 million in children (>15 years) and 0.07 case s per 1 million in adults (>18  years).16-18 A study examining \nSEER registry data in the United States showed that 5 -year overall \nsurvival for adults with LCH was 88.5%, but , while  many cases are mild \nand asymptomatic, rapidly progressing and/or disseminated life-\nthreatening disease that is resistant to treatment may also occur.19 The \nHistiocyte Society’s initial 1987 classification categorized LCH as an \nimmunologic inflammatory disease but not as a neoplasm.4 However, \npresence of clonal histiocytes supports the neoplastic origin of LCH.20,21 \nRecurrent activating mutations in the MAPK pathway are found in the \nvast majority of cases.8,22 These discoveries support the WHO’s \nclassification of histiocytic disorders, particularly LCH as a neoplastic \nprocess.23 In the Histiocyte Society’s revised classification, four \ncategories of LCH are identified: single system, pulmonary -involved, \nmultisystem with risk organ involvement, and multisystem without risk \norgan involvement.1 \nCommon sites of involvement of LCH include bone, skin, pituitary gland, \nliver, spleen, bone marrow, lungs, and lymph nodes.24 There is also a \nhigh prevalence of concomitant and subsequent malignancies, \nespecially solid tumors or myeloid malignancies, in adults with LCH.18,25 \nA pulmonary form of LCH can occur in adults and is associated with \nsmoking.21,26,27 Multifocal bone lesions without the involvement of other \norgans may also be observed in some cases, and bone mineral density may be lower than the expected range in adults with LCH.\n28 Permanent \nendocrinopathy is common in LCH, such as diabetes insipidus (now \nreferred to arginine vasopressin [AVP] deficiency) , which more \ncommonly occurs with multisystem disease.21,29,30 Though there are \ncases of solitary central nervous system ( CNS )-involved LCH, CNS \ninvolvement is most often accompanied with multi -system disease.24 \nCNS -involved LCH can present as space- occupying granulom atous \ntumors, frequently in the hypothalamic -pituitary region but also involving \nthe choroid plexus, meninges, grey or white matter , or as PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:43:45 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHistiocytic Neoplasms   \n \nMS-5 \nneurodegenerative LCH (ND- LCH) lesions in the cerebellum and brain \nstem .31 The bone lesions in the mastoid, sphenoid, orbit, temporal bone,  \nand clivus re present CNS -risk lesions, indicating increased ris k of \ndeveloping CNS -involved LCH.31 ND-LCH is frequent in patients with \npituitary, skin, and base- of-skull bone involvement. A study of children \nand young adults with LCH (N = 1897) showed that a BRAF  mutation \nwas present in 93.7% of patients with ND -LCH,  compared to 54.1% in \npatients without ND -LCH.32 The 10-year risk of developing  \nneurodegenerative disease is 33.1% in patients with a BRAF  mutation, \ncompared to 2.9% in patients without a BRAF  mutation ( P = .002) .  \nDiagnosis of LCH  \nInitial diagnostic testing is dependent on clinical presentation. Essential \nworkup for LCH involves a comprehensive H&P examination with \nspecific attention to common sites of involvement,  including the skin; \nhead, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT); bone, lymph node, liver, \nspleen, lung, and CNS .21,33 Whole- body fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG )-\nPET/CT , including distal extremities,  should be performed along with \npulmonary function tests (PFTs)  to evaluate for obstructive airway \ndisease, air trapping, and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity.21,26 FDG -\nPET/CT is superior to other cross -sectional imaging techniques for \ndetection of sites of active LCH, with the exception of pulmonary \nlesions.34-36 Bone involvement, which may appear as aggressive \ncortically -based lytic lesions, is also best detected using full -body \n(vertex -to-toes) FDG -PET/CT.3 It is controversial whether whole- body \nimaging is required for every patient with LCH, such as those presenting \nonly with skin involvement, or those with symptoms limited to the lungs. \nHowever, whether a patient’s LCH is single or multisystem is unknown \nin the absence of imaging and should be considered for patients with \nsuspected multisystem disease.  High-resolution CT of the chest for \nsuspected pulmonary LCH  is recommended as it33 may detect nodules \n≤2 mm in the early stages of pulmonary LCH, and irregular cysts in the lungs may be observed in advanced disease.3,21 Laboratory tests , \ninclud ing those mentioned in the earlier Characteristics and Diagnostic \nEvaluation of Histiocytic Neoplasms  section of this Discussion,  are also \npart of the essential workup for LCH.21,33  \nFurther  workup may be  useful depending on symptoms or organ \ninvolvement . Additional imaging can be conducted including: CT  with \ncontrast  of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis  and MRI with and without \ncontrast of the brain, spine , and sella turcica with or without pituitary  \nevaluation, if AVP deficiency  is suspected . Abnormal brain MRI is often \nobserved in LCH, even in the absence of neurologic symptoms.24 \nFindings on brain MRI can mimic primary CNS tumors, brain \nmetastases, or inflammatory granulomatous diseases.24 In ND -LCH, \nsignal changes in white and deep gray matter with cortical atrophy may \nbe observed with MRI.31 In cases that manifest with AVP deficiency , the \nearliest change seen on MRI may be an enlargement of the pituitary \nstalk, and later the space -occupying tumors extending to the pituitary \ngland and hypothalamus. There is  typically a ‘‘loss of bright spot’’ ( ie, \nthe lack of the physiologic  hyperintense signal in the posterior pituitary \non T1 -weighted  images ), which is secondary to  the loss of antidiuretic  \nhormone -containing granules . Not all patients with AVP deficiency  will \nhave an abnormal MRI.  \nUltrasound of the abdomen allows for determination of  hepatic and \nspleen involvement, and other imaging techniques such as endoscopic \nretrograde cholangiopancreatography and digital panoramic dental x -\nray can also be performed as clinically indicated. Right heart \ncatheterization should be performed if pulmonary hypertension is \nsuspected, and transthoracic echocardiogram  (TTE)  is also \nrecommended to screen for pulmonary hypertension.3 Endocrine \nevaluation is encouraged  for those with detected endocrinopathy or \npituitary hypothalamic involvement.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHistiocytic Neoplasms   \n \nMS-6 \npsychological assessments should be included for select patients.21 The \ncomplete recommendations for evaluation of LCH are provided in the \nalgorithm (see Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis: Workup/Evaluation ) and \nare adapted from recommendations in the consensus statement by the Mayo Clinic Histiocytosis Working Group\n3  \nWhile diagnosis of LCH is based on clinical and radiologic findings, \nbiopsy of tumor tissue is also recommended (see Histop athologic \nCharacterization of LCH  below in this Discussion).21 Morphologically, in \nLCH, histiocytes with grooved nuclei are observed along with \neosinophilia. IHC analysis of tumor tissue, which should include a \nminimal panel of CD1a, S100, and Langerin as well as cyclin D1 and \nBRAF  V600E VE1 IHC, is recommended at this time along with NGS  \nand gene fusion assays to evaluate for somatic genetic variants of the \nMAPK and other related pathways (see Histopathologic \nCharacterization of LCH  below for more information). If biopsy is not \npossible due to location or other risk factors, mutational analysis of \nperipheral blood is an option.  If a patient  has an unexplained, abnormal  \nCBC, a bone marrow biopsy should also be considered to rule out \nhemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or myeloid neoplasm.  Because \nLCH frequently presents with lytic bone lesions,  differential diagnosis \nmay include multiple myeloma and metastatic bone involvement from \nother cancers. Skin involvement may be mistaken for seborrheic \ndermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, Candida infection, intertrigo, and lichen \nplanus.21 Langerhans cell hyperplasia can be associated with mycosis \nfungoides , which could be mis interpreted as a composite LCH.37 \nDifferential diagnosis for single- system pulmonary LCH includes \nhypersensitivity pneumonitis , interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary \nlymphangioleiomyomatosis , and sarcoidosis.   \n  Histopathologic Characterization of LCH  \nCytologic features typically observed with LCH include an oval -shaped \nnucleus that is retiform with irregular nuclear contours , an \ninconspicuous nucleoli , and abundant  cytoplasm.15 On hematoxylin and \neosin ( H&E) stain, neoplastic LCH cells are mononucleated, typically \nwith a coffee bean- shaped nucleus.1,22,38 LCH tumors often demonstrate \nneoplastic histiocytes admixed with marked inflammatory cell infiltration. \nAbundant eosinophils and multinucleated giant cells are frequently \nobserved.1-3 Pathology of lesions from LCH -associated abnormal CNS \nimaging (LACI) and LCH -associated abnormal CNS symptoms (LACS) \nshow infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes, and, unlike other LCH tumors, lack \nCD1a -positive histiocytes.39 Birbeck granules can be identified by \nelectron microscope, which is, however, now not commonly performed . \nFibrosis may be present, particularly in bone lesions.3 \nIHC analysis of LCH tumors demonstrates  abundant CD1a-  and \nCD207 - (Langerin) positive neoplastic histiocytes that are  also positive \nfor S100 and cyclin D1 .3,22,38 Cyclin D1 can be helpful for differentiating \nneoplastic Langerhans cells from reactive Langerhans cell proliferation.\n40,41 Activation of RAS -RAF-MAPK pathway is universal in \nall patients with LCH.5,42 A BRAF V600E  activating mutation is the most \nprevalent, presenting in 38% to 64% of LCH cases, and carries \nprognostic significance. 5,6,43- 47 This mutation is more frequent in mixed \nLCH/ECD, when compared to isolated LCH or ECD.48 Thus, BRAF \nV600E  (VE1) should also be evaluated using IHC.

ALK \nIHC and FISH studies can be used if there is a concern for ALK \nrearrangement and fusion panel testing is not available.  For complete \nrecommendations regarding pathologic analysis of LCH cases, see the Princip les of Pathology  section in the algorithm . \nTreatment of LCH  \nMuch of the evidence for treatment of LCH is extrapolated from prospective studies of children and adolescents. Studies of adults with \nLCH are limited to case series and retrospective studies. Treatment \ndecisions for LCH should be made based on sites and extent of \ndisease.\n21 \nUnifocal and Single System Disease with No Critical Organ Involvement  \nFor patients with single system disease and no involvement of critical \norgans (ie, CNS, liver , spleen), treatment is limited to local therapy  \n(surgical excision or RT)  and observation.21 \nLimited curettage is recommended for patients with isolated bone \nlesions,54 but complete resection of bone lesions is not recommended, \nas this may result in an increase in the size of the bony defect and permanent skeletal defects.\n21 Corticos teroid injection, with triamcinolone \nor equivalent,  may facilitate healing after limited curettage.21 Low-dose \nradiation therapy for treatment of bone -involved LCH is associated with \nexcellent local disease control.55,56 For patients with single system bone \ndisease, radiation therapy may be used for some patients with limited \nsites of disease, specifically in cases with impending neurologic dysfunction and if surgical risk is high.21 “Limited” sites of disease is \ngenerally defined as 1 to 2  lesions in this context, though radiation \ntherapy may be considered for up to three bone lesions as clinically \nindicated. The recommended radiation dose for treatment of bone -\ninvolved LCH in adults is 10 to 20 Gy.21,55 Bisphosphonate therapy is \npreferred if bone lesions are not amenable to local therapies due to size \nand location (See Principles of Systemic Therapy  in the algorithm ). \nObservation is also reasonable for asymptomatic and isolated bone \nlesions.  \nFor patients with single system isolated skin disease, topical therapies may be used.\n54 Case reports describing treatment of older adults with \ncutaneous LCH support the use of psoralen with ultraviolet A  (PUVA)  or \nnarrowband ultraviolet B  (UVB) .57,58 Other topical therapies such as \nnitrogen mustard (eg, mechlorethamine) and steroids  (triamcinolone \ninjection or equivalent corticosteroid)  are alternative options that have \nbeen shown to be effective in children with cutaneous LCH,59,60 though \nthere are no published data in adults with LCH. Surgery should only be performed for solitary skin lesions, and only for those in which surgery \nwill not result in disfigurement. Low -dose RT is also an option for these \npatients, and s ystemic therapy may be used for symptomatic disease \nincluding pain, secondary infection, or if there are complications from skin lesions.\n54 Isolated skin- involved LCH has been reported to resolve \nspontaneously,61 so observation is also an option for these patients.  \nMultisystem or Multifocal  Single -System  Disease or Unifocal Disease \nwith Critical Organ Involvement or that Progresses on Local Therapy  \nSystemic therapy is often required for the treatment of multisystem \nLCH, multifocal single system  LCH, unifocal disease involving a critical \norgan such as CNS, liver, spleen, or unifocal  disease that progresses \non local therapy  (see Systemic Therapy  for LCH , described below). \nHowever, if asymptomatic or if there is no impending organ dysfunction, \nobservation  may be considered.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHistiocytic Neoplasms   \n \nMS-8 \nprogression in ND -LCH, warranting consideration of early treatment , \nand cognitive symptoms should be carefully evaluated and monitored . \nBisphosphonates (eg, zoledronic acid or pamidronate) are \nrecommended for treatment of multifocal bone disease,  which  is \nsupported by small retrospective studies and case series.62,63 In the \nabsence of disease response following treatment with a \nbisphosphonate, other systemic therapy regimens may be considered \n(see Systemic Therapy  for LCH , described below). Radiation therapy \ncan also be considered in patients with persistent disease with limited disease sites following systemic treatment.\n21,64 \nSince pulmonary LCH is associated with smoking, treatment should \ninclude smoking cessation (see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking \nCessation, available at www.NCCN.org ). Pulmonary LCH could resolve \nwith smoking cessation alone.54 Therefore, observation is an option, \nparticularly in patients with asymptomatic disease or who have minor \nsymptoms. Systemic therapy can be considered in patients with \nsymptomatic and/or progressive pulmonary LCH, as well as in patients \nwith persistent di sease despite smoking cessation (see Systemic \nTherapy  for LCH , described below). High- dose prednisone (1 mg/kg/day \nfor 1 month, followed by a slow taper) can also be effective in treatment \nof pulmonary LCH.21 Steroid treatment is often associated with \nradiographic improvements in pulmonary LCH but may not improve the \nrespiratory function.65 Lung transplant should be considered only in \nselect patients with highly refractory and severe disease.54 \nSystemic Therapy for LCH  \nSystemic therapy is the standard treatment  in the first - or subsequent -\nline settings  for multisystem and/or multifocal LCH, but responses to \ncommonly used regimens in adults with LCH tend to be less robust \ncompared to children. Preferred systemic therapy regimens  for \nmultisystem or single -system lung LCH and LCH CNS lesions  currently include vemurafenib for BRAF  V600E mutated disease, cobimetinib for \npatients with MAP kinase pathway mutation , no other \ndetectable/actionab le mutation, or if testing is not available, and \ncytarabine or cladribine,  irrespective of mutation.   \nPrior to 2012, there were relatively few effective treatment options for histiocytic neoplasms. The discovery of BRAF V600E  and other gene \nmutations resulting in overactive MAPK pathway in histiocytic \nneoplasms led to a promising avenue of targeted therapies for patients \nwith these rare cancers. The phase II VE -BASKET study evaluated the \nefficacy of BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib.\n66 The final efficacy and safety \nanalysis included 26 adults with BRAF  V600E -mutated LCH or ECD \n(85% ECD) and showed an overall response rate ( ORR)  of 61.5% (95% \nCI, 40.6% –79.8%).67 Two-year progression- free survival ( PFS)  and \noverall survival ( OS) rates were 86% (95% CI, 72% –100%) and 96% \n(95% CI, 87% –100%), respectively. Median PFS and OS were not \nreached. A metabolic response as measured with FDG -PET/CT was \nachieved in all of the patients who were evaluated (n = 15; 80% complete response [ CR], 20% partial response [ PR]). The most \ncommon grade 3– 4 adverse events were hypertension (27%), \nmaculopapular rash (23%), increased lipase (15%), arthralgia (12%), \nhyperkeratosis (8%), and acti nic keratosis (8%). All patients required \ndose reduction due to toxicities.  \nThere is also evidence supporting the use of MEK inhibitors for \ntreatment of histiocytic neoplasms. The MEK inhibitor cobimetinib was \nevaluated in a phase II trial including 18 adult patients diagnosed with a \nhistiocytic neoplasm (67% ECD, 11% LCH, 11% RDD , and 11% mixed \nhistiocytosis).\n12 The ORR was 89% (one -sided 90% CI, 73% –100%), \nwith a CR having been observed in 72% of patients. Median duration of \nresponse ( DOR ) and PFS were not reached after a median follow -up of \n11.9 months.

Though a mutation in the MAPK pathway was \ndetected in 83% of patients, the efficacy of cobimetinib was not limited \nto these patients, indicating that cobimetinib can be used in any patient \nwith a histiocytic disorder for whom systemic therapy is indicated.  \nAdverse events in patients with histiocytic disorders treated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors are consistent with those observed in previously \npublished studies (eg, rash,  pyrexia),\n22 but the VE -BASKET trial showed \nthat rates of hypertension and skin -related adverse events were higher \nin histiocytic neoplasms than previously observed in patients with \nmetastatic melanoma.67 \nCladribine is a chemotherapy option that has been shown to be active in \nadults with LCH . A recent single- center phase II trial of 61 newly \ndiagnosed adults with LCH  revealed an  ORR of 93.4% with 20 patients \nachieving a complete response and 37 demonstrating a partial \nresponse.68 Moreover, the estimated 3- year OS and EFS were 100% \nand 58.8%, respectively.68 Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and nausea \nwere the most common grade 3– 4 toxicities.68 However, f or patients \nwho received cladribine as part of single- center retrospective study in \n58 patients with bone- involved LCH, 59% did not respond to treatment \nor relapsed in the first year while the chemotherapy, cytarabine,  showed \nlower toxicity with grade 3– 4 adverse events being reported in 20% of \npatients who received cytarabine, compared to 37% who received \ncladribine. Low -dose cytarabine is better tolerated in adults, but higher \ndoses should be used for patients with CNS lesions.  \nOther recommended regimens for patients with multisystem or single-\nsystem lung LCH or CNS lesions include: dabrafenib for BRAF  V600E -\nmutated disease, trametinib, binimetinib, or selumetinib for MAP kinase pathway mutation or no other detectable/actionab le mutation, or  for \nthose for whom  testing  was not available. Encouraging results from a case series support the use of dabrafenib, a second- generation BRAF \ninhibitor, in adults with LCH. Dabrafenib may be better tolerated than \nvemurafenib based on this case series, although there was no \nprospective head- to-head comparison.\n69 Use of dabrafenib in patient s \nwith ND- LCH led to rapid symptomatic and radiographic improvement.  \nUse of the MEK inhibitor trametinib for treatment of LCH is supported by \ncase series and case reports.70-72 In one case report, a combination of \ndabrafenib and trametinib demonstrated a sustained response in an \nadult woman with BRAF  V600E -mutated LCH.73 Binimetinib or \nselumetinib are recommended if neither cobimetinib or trametinib are \nnot tolerated.  \nMethotrexate plus cytarabine, hydroxyurea, clofarabine, \nvinblastine/prednisone, or oral methotrexate, are also other \nrecommended regimens for patients with multisystem or single- system \nlung LCH, irrespective of mutation while high -dose methotrexate or \nmethotrexate plus cytarabine are other recommended regimens  for \npatients with CNS lesions . A prospective single- center phase II trial \nfrom China examined combination of cytarabine (100 mg/m2) and \nmethotrexate (1 g/m2) as treatment for adults with multisystem o r single \nsystem multifocal LCH (N = 83). ORR, 3 -year OS, and 3- year event -free \nsurvival (EFS) were 87.9%, 97.7%, and 68.0%, respectively.74 The long-\nterm follow -up of this study recently indicated that, after a median \nfollow- up of 6.5 years, the ORR, 6- year OS, and 6- year EFS were \n89.5%, 93.2%, and 55.2%, respectively.75 Additionally,  a retrospective \nstudy conducted at a hospital in China examined cytarabine and \nmethotrexate combination in adults with multisystem pulmonary -\ninvolved LCH (N = 29). Pulmonary function was stable in 72.4% (n = 24), improved in 13.8% (n = 4), and deteriorated in 13.8% (n = 4) of \npatients.\n76 Since both cytarabine and methotrexate cross the blood-\nbrain barrier, this combination regimen may be ideal for treatment of \nCNS -involved LCH.74 Vinblastine plus prednisone is the preferred PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:43:45 PM.

In this study, 84% of patients who received vinblastine and prednisone developed progressive disease within the \nfirst year, compared to 21% of patients who received cytarabine (OR, \n20.3; 95% CI, 4.20– 98.20; P < .001).\n77 There is also evidence \nsupporting clofarabine for relapsed/refractory LCH in the pediatric \nsetting, with disease improvement observed in 73% of 11 patients.78 \nNeutropenia occurred in all patients.  \nHigh-dose methotrexate is also an option for CNS -involved LCH, based \non a case report of a patient with CNS -involved ECD  while low- dose \noral methotrexate has been shown to be effective and non- toxic in a \ncase report of a 40- year-old patient with LCH , which was also supported \nin children treated with low -dose methotrexate plus prednisone for low -\nrisk LCH.79-81 In addition, hydroxyurea demonstrated promising activity \nwith 80% of patients demonstrating either a PR or CR with minimal toxicities.\n82 \nTargeted therapies may be useful in certain circumstances for patients with multisystem or single system lung LCH or CNS lesions and include: \ncrizotinib for ALK  fusion, pexidartinib for CSF1R  mutation, larotrectinib, \nentrectinib, or repotrectinib for NTRK  gene fusions, sirolimus or \neverolimus for PIK3CA mutation, or selpercatinib for RET  fusion.  \nActivating mutations in CSF1R  and rearrangements involving RET  and \nALK in rare cases of LCH highlight the potential clinical benefit of other \nkinase inhibitors and should be considered in select cases with such alterations.\n53 Since NTRK  fusions can occur in histiocytic disorders,83 \nthe TRK inhibitors larotrectinib,84 entrectinib,85 and repotrectinib86 may \nalso be used as indicated. Sirolimus and everolimus can be effective for \nPIK3CA- mutated LCH, based on extrapolation of data from patients with ECD (see Treatment of ECD in this Discussion, below).7,87 It is of note \nthat targeted therapies can be started at lower doses. Additionally, \nallogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant is recommended for highly \nselect patients with multisystem or single -system lung LCH.88 \nFor bone disease only LCH, preferred regimens include bisphosphonates , which were  discussed earlier in this Discussion. For \nmultifocal single -system bone disease not responsive to \nbisphosphonates, the preferred, other recommended and useful in \ncertain circumstances  options  mentioned earlier in this Discussion  for \nmultisystem disease can be considered.  \nSingle -system m ultifocal skin disease can be treated with oral \nmethotrexate or hydroxyurea (both preferred regimens) or lenalidomide \nor thalidomide (both other recommended regimens ). Small retrospective \nstudies and case reports support this use of specific chemotherapy \noptions for multifocal skin- involved LCH. A single- center retrospective \nstudy evaluated hydroxyurea monotherapy and in combination with oral \nmethotrexate in 15 patients with relapsed/refractory LCH (mostly skin-\ninvolved) with a  median age of 41.2 years (range , 2–73 years).\n82 An \nORR of 80.0% was observed, and symptom progression or relapse \nafter initial response was observed in 40%, with median time to \nprogression of 5.7 months. Grade 3– 4 adverse events were reported in \nonly two patients. Retrospective data also support use of oral methotrexate combined with prednisone in children with low -risk LCH \n(ie, no bone marrow involvement or organ dysfunction) that was mostly \nbone-  and/or skin- involved.\n80 Thalidomide was evaluated in a phase II \nstudy including 12 children and four adults with LCH.89 Among 10 \npatients with low -risk disease (involvement of skin, lungs, and lymph \nnodes), an ORR of 70% was observed (4 CRs, 3 PRs).

It should also be \nperformed after completion of surgical curettage and after RT.  LCH may \nrelapse or reactivate following systemic therapy, which most commonly \noccurs in the first 2 years following treatment.54 Development of AVP \ndeficiency  after treatment may be a sign of disease reactivation.54 \nFollow -up assessment depends on extent of disease and organ \ninvolvement, and a complete list of recommendations for surveillance following treatment of LCH can be found in the algorithm (see \nLangerhans Cell Histiocytosis: Follow -up in the algorithm.  \nTreatment for Relapsed/Refractory Disease  \nIn relapsed and refractory LCH, an alternate systemic therapy regimen \nother than the one used in the first line may be utilized . However, if \nDOR to the first -line regimen was > 1 year, repeating the same \ntreatment may also be considered.21 \nErdheim- Chester Disease \nECD is a rare histiocytic neoplasm, with approximately 1500 cases \nhaving been reported worldwide as of 2020.  An increase in detection of \ncases has been observed over time, potentially due to improved \nrecognition of this disease through imaging and pathology.15,24,91 ECD \npredominantly affects adults  and is rarely observed in children, with a \nmedian age of approximately 45 years in the United States, and is more common in men than women.15,24,91 Mixed ECD/LCH is fairly common, \nwith LCH lesions reported in 20% of patients with ECD.48 \nSimilar to LCH, ECD presentation can range from single system and \nasymptomatic disease to severe multisystem and life- threatening \ndisease. Prognosis is predominantly influenced by specific organ involvement.\n91 Bone involvement affects almost all patients with ECD, \nwith lower extremity bone pain being an especially common initial presenting symptom. Cardiovascular involvement, including pericardial \ndisease, is reported to occur in about half of all patients\n92-94 and is \nassociated with poor prognosis.95 Other affected organs/systems \ninclude the lungs, endocrine system, skin, and kidneys.24,96 Periarterial \nfibrosis of the thoracic and/or abdominal aorta, referred to as “coated \naorta,” is also commonly observed.91,93,95,97- 100 Retroperitoneal \ninvolvement tends to be asymptomatic, but extension to the renal sinus \nor middle to distal ureters may result in hydronephrosis.101- 103 CNS \ninvolvement occurs in 15% to 55% of cases24,91,104 and is associated \nwith worse prognosis.105 Some ECD -related CNS lesions cause \nintracranial vascular infiltration, putting these patients at risk of ischemic \nstroke. AVP deficiency  is the most common endocrine disorder in ECD, \naffecting about 25% to 50% of patients.3,91,106 Other commonly observed \nendocrine manifestations of ECD include hyperprolactinemia, \nhypogonadism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism.3,106 \nExophthalmos is also fairly common in ECD, and xanthelasma of the \neyelids and periorbital spaces is a common cutaneous manifestation of \nECD.1,91 Involvement of the facial bones and maxillary sinuses has also \nbeen seen.97 \nTwo retrospective studies demonstrated that a concomitant myeloid \nneoplasm can occur in 3% to 10% of ECD107,108; the higher rate (10%) \nin one study is likely due to inclusion of patients with mixed LCH/ECD.\n107 In one case series, median age of patients with ECD and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:43:45 PM.

H&P is part of the essential workup for \nECD with special attention needed to the common sites of involvement : \nthe long bones (bilateral and symmetric diaphyseal and metaphyseal \nosteosclerosis with subchondral sparing); orbits (retro- orbital mass with \nexophthalmos; zanthelasma); CNS (pituitary glan d, posterior fossa); \nlungs (interstitial changes); vascular (periaortic infiltrate; pericardium, right atrium); retroperitoneal/perinephritic or “hairy kidney” . The \npresence of hairy kidney is highly suggestive of ECD and is present in \n50% to 68% of patients while periarterial infiltration involving the \nthoracic or abdominal aorta and other vessels is present in 56% to 85% \nof patients with ECD.\n3 Laboratory tests should also be conducted, and , \nsimilar to LCH, should include CBC, blood chemistry, coagulation \nstudies, TSH, free T4, morning urine and serum osmolality, morning \nserum cortisol with ACTH, prolactin, IGF- 1, and FSH/LH with \ntestosterone  or estradiol. C -reactive protein should also be evaluated, \nas it is often elevated in patients with ECD.3,24 Whole- body FDG -\nPET/CT scan, which should include distal extremities, is also \nrecommended along with a tissue biopsy as part of the essential workup \nfor ECD . Full -body (vertex -to-toes) FDG -PET/CT is preferred to bone \nscan, as it allows for evaluation of metadiaphyseal osteosclerosis of the \nknees as well as other organ involvement.3,15 Bilateral, symmetric \ndiaphyseal, and metaphyseal osteosclerosis of the long bones of lower \nextremities is a characteristic finding of ECD.2,3,15,24 In fact, bilateral \nsymmetrical osteosclerosis of the metadiaphyseal bones around the \nknees is very common (>95%) and is pathognomonic of ECD .3 Additional  evaluation is based on symptoms or organ involvement . CT \nof the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast, sinuses with contrast , \nhigh- resolution CT of the chest , or MRI with and without contrast of the \nbrain, orbit, spin, and sella turcica with or without pituitary (if AVP \ndeficiency  is suspected) are encouraged. CNS involvement may be \ndetected using brain MRI with gadolinium contrast, and common \nfindings include cerebellar and brain stem hyperintensities, cerebral \nwhite matter enhancement, and t hickening of the pituitary stalk.3,24 \n“Coated aorta” may be detected with CT, and arterial lesions \ncharacterized by circumferential thickening may be observed.3,24,91,102 \n“Hairy kidney” detected on abdominal CT is characteristic of ECD \n(rarely seen in RDD and not seen in LCH) due to diffuse bilateral \ninfiltration leading to stellate pattern of perinephric soft tissue \nthickening.3,102 Adrenal hypertrophy may be observed if the perirenal \ninfiltration extends to the adrenal gland.102 In ECD with pulmonary \ninvolvement, chest CT may demonstrate mediastinal infiltration, pleural \nthickening, pleural effusion, and other pulmonary parenchymal \nabnormalities.3 PFTs, TTE (especially for suspected pulmonary ECD), \nrenal artery and testicular US, as well as technetium -99m MDP bone \nscintigraphy are also useful under certain circumstances. Cardiac \ninvolvement can also be determined with echocardiography and/or \ncardiac MRI. Findings and radiographic abnormalities include \npericardial thickening, pericardial effusion, and myocardial infiltration, \nwhich, if present, most often involve the right atrioventricular groove and \nright atrial wall.3 Subspecialty consultations (eg, neurology, \nendocrinology, nephrology, urology) should be carried out as clinically indicated. As with LCH, dermatology and ophthalmology evaluations \nmay be considered for management of toxicities associated with BRAF \nand MEK  inhibitors.\n11-13 The complete recommendations for evaluation \nof ECD are provided in the algorithm and are adapted from recommendations from an expert consensus group\n15 (see Erdheim -\nChester Disease: Workup/Evaluation in the algorithm.

Differential \ndiagnosis should include evaluation for IgG4- related disease, which has \na clinical presentation similar to that for ECD.24 If ECD is present, the  \nbiopsy will show foamy histiocytes  and Touton giant cells ; however, this  \nmay be obscured by fibrosis or lympho plasmac ytic infiltrate.110 IHC \nanalysis should also be performed and include, at a minimum , \nevaluation of : CD68  or CD163+, S100 , factor XIIa, and CD1a . BRAF  \nV600E ( VE1) IHC is also recommended. Allele -specific PCR for BRAF  \nV600E mutations can be the first step if VE1 is not available. Further \nmolecular testing , includ ing NGS of fresh or paraffin- embedded tumor \ntissue , should also be performed  and cover the common MAPK \npathway mutations ( BRAF , ARAF , NRAS , KRAS, MAP2K1/2 ) and other \nrelated pathway mutations (eg, PIK3CA , CSF1R). Gene f usion assays \nusing an RNA -based molecular panel is  also recommended and should \ncover BRAF , ALK, RET, and NTRK1  rearrangements. If clinically \nindicated in cases without the usual MAPK pathway mutations, FISH for \nBRAF , ALK, RET, or NTRK1  fusions may be performed. If there is a \nclinical concern for ALK rearrangement or if fusion panel testing is not available, ALK IHC and FISH studies  can be performed. Molecular \ntesting for somatic mutations and fusions  should be conducted  in a \nstepwise manner or in parallel, depending on clinical need and \ninstitutional protocols. The frequency of suspected molecular lesions \nshould drive the order of testing if a stepwise algorithm is chosen.  \nMutational analysis of the peripheral blood is also an option if a biopsy is not possible due to location or risk factors.\n110 Peripheral blood testing \nmay be informative in multisystem disease.  Determination of these \nmolecular alterations should be performed, where available, as this aids \nboth in the diagnosis of ECD and treatment decision- making.15 For more information, see Pathologic Analysis of Histiocytic Disorders  and \nHistopathologic Characterization of ECD  in this Discussion.  \nHistopathologic Characterization of ECD  \nOn H&E stain, ECD tumor tissue often demonstrates foamy mononucleated histiocytes with a small nucleus  and an inconspicuous \nnucleoli , surrounding fibrosis, xanthogranulomatosis, and Touton giant \ncells.\n2,3,15,24 Additionally, the cytoplasm is classically abundant, \namorphous, and lipid- laden. Inflammatory cells, including reactive  \nlymphocytes , neutrophils,  and plasma cells are the common \nbackground cells with eosinophils being rare. Dense fibrosis may also \nbe observed.15 On IHC, neoplastic histiocytes are typically CD68-\npositive, CD163- positive, CD14 -positive, factor XIIIa -positive, CD1a -\nnegative, and CD207 ( Langerin) -negative.2,24,91 Typical features of the \nstroma a s well as the  histiocytic and reactive infiltrate have been found \nto vary depending on disease location (ie, bone, central nervous system \n[CNS], lung, skin, orbit, retroperitoneum, cardiac tissue).111 CD1a -\npositive, S100 -positive, and L angerin- positive findings can help \ndistinguish LCH from ECD.1,91 The possible presence of S100- positive \ncells with emperipolesis may lead to challenges in distinguishing ECD from RDD.\n1 15 \nSomatic mutations contributing to ECD partially overlap with that of \nLCH.2 BRAF V600E  activating mutations are present in 38% to 68% of \nECD cases.6,7,91,97,110,111 Other prevalent gene mutations in ECD include \nMAP2K1 /2, ARAF , NRAS , KRAS, and PIK3CA.7,8,110,111 PIK3CA \nactivating mutations are more common in ECD than LCH . Moreover, \nCSF1R  mutations and BRAF, ALK, and NTRK1  fusions are found in a \nsmall number of ECD cases.8,53,110 ECD co -occurring with RDD is most \ncommonly driven by mutations in MAP2K1 /2.111,112 Extracutaneous or \ndisseminated juvenile xanthogranuloma with mutations in the MAPK \npathway has similar histopathology and phenotype to ECD and thus PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:43:45 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHistiocytic Neoplasms   \n \nMS-14 \nmay be considered ECD.1 BRAF V600E  (VE1) should be evaluated \nusing IHC, but allele- specific PCR for BRAF V600E  may be considered; \nsee Histopathologic Characterization of LCH above. As with LCH, panel \ntesting should include other mutations in the MAPK  and other related  \npathway s. For complete recommendations regarding pathologic \nanalysis of ECD cases, see the Principles of Pathology  in the algorithm.  \nTreatment of ECD  \nTreatment of ECD mainly consists of systemic therapy, though \nobservation  may be considered for patients with asymptomatic disease \nnot involving critical organs such as the heart, brain, and CNS.  \nPreferred regimens for ECD in the first - or subsequent -line setting \ninclude vemurafenib for BRAF  V600E -mutated disease and cobimetinib \nfor patients with other  MAP kinase pathway mutations, no other \ndetectable/actionable mutation present , or if testing is not available. As \ndiscussed in the previous section covering targeted therapy in LCH, the \nphase II VE -BASKET study showed that vemurafenib is highly effective \nin patients with BRAF  V600E -mutated ECD that is associated with near \nuniversal responses.67 Results from the VE -BASKET study led to the \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approval of vemurafenib for \ntreatment of ECD. However, the FDA -approved dose (960 mg twice \ndaily) is associated with significant toxicity that very often results in discontinuation, dose interruption, or dose modification.\n67 A \nretrospective study carried out at an NCCN Member Institution including \n23 patients with BRAF  V600E -mutated ECD showed that progressive \ndisease did not occur in patients (n = 14) who received vemurafenib \nadministered at half the FDA -approved dose (ie, 480 mg twice daily), \nthough half of these patients still required further dose reduction, with \n29% discontinuing vemurafenib treatment due to adverse events.113 \nAdditionally, t he MEK inhibitor, c obimetinib,  demonstrated efficacy in  \nECD in the phase II study  by Diamond et al12 discussed previously where 18 patients (12 of which had ECD) demonstrated consistent and \ndurable responses when treated with this drug (see Systemic Therapy \nfor LCH above for more information about this trial ).  \nOther recommended regimens  for patients with ECD include dabrafenib \nfor BRAF  V600E mutated disease and trametinib for MAP kinase \npathway mutation or no  other detectable/actionable mutation. \nIrrespective of mutation, c ladribine, pegylated interferon alpha- 2a and \nalpha- 2b, sirolimus plus prednisone, oral methotrexate, or  anakinra  may \nalso be used . The efficacy of dabrafenib for BRAF V600E -mutated ECD \nis supported by a retrospective single- center French study114 and a \nmulticenter case series.115 As with LCH, dabrafenib appears to be less \ntoxic than vemurafenib.115 As described above for LCH (see Systemic \nTherapy  for LCH ), in a phase II trial in which 67% of patients were \ndiagnosed with ECD, a 72% CR rate was demonstrated for cobimetinib.\n12 These promising results were not limited to patients with \na mutation in the MAPK pathway. A small study supports use of the MEK inhibitor trametinib for treatment of non- LCH histiocytic \nneoplasms, regardless of molecular profile.\n116 \nPrior to the availability of targeted therapy for ECD, the largest body of evidence supported the use of interferon alpha- 2a and pegylated \ninterferon alpha for the treatment of ECD.\n91 In a multicenter, \nprospective, nonrandomized study conducted in Europe (N = 53), \ninterferon alpha or pegylated interferon alpha treatment was associated \nwith improved survival (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.14– 0.70; P = .006).105 A \nsingle -center report from France (N = 8) showed that interferon alpha \nwas most effective for relieving exophthalmos, bilateral hydronephrosis, \nand xanthelasma related to ECD, and was associated with a decrease \nin C- reactive protein.117 This report cautioned against the use of \ninterferon alpha in patients with ECD involving the CNS and/or \ncardiovascular system.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHistiocytic Neoplasms   \n \nMS-15 \nFrance reported outcomes for a larger cohort (N = 24) that showed \nhigh- dose interferon alpha was associated with a clinical and/or \nradiologic improvement in 46% of patients, including those with severe \nECD with CNS or cardiovascular involvement.118 Interferon alpha as a \ntreatment option for ECD is also supported by several case \nreports.119,120 Interferon alpha has been discontinued in the United \nStates and is therefore not recommended in the NCCN Guidelines. Pegylated interferon alpha, which has a more  favorable toxicity profile \ncompared to interferon alpha, is recommended as a substitute based on  \nthe evidence discussed above. P eginterferon alfa- 2a is the only  \npeginterferon alfa  available for clinical use in the United States , and it \nmay be substituted for peginterferon alfa -2b.\n121- 123  \nEvidence supporting other systemic therapy options for treatment of \nECD is primarily based on retrospective single- center studies and case \nseries. A retrospective study conducted at an NCCN Member Institution \nevaluated the efficacy of cladribine as first - or subsequent -line treatment \nof ECD (n = 21).124 The clinical ORR was 52%, with CR and PR \nobserved in 4% and 46% of patients, respectively. Progressive disease \nwas observed in 30% of patients. The response was durable, with the \nmedian DOR of 9 months in the responders. Toxicities associated with \ncladrib ine were relatively minimal. In a single- center study from Italy \nincluding 10 patients with ECD, sirolimus combined with prednisone was associated with an ORR of 60% (all PRs).\n125 Oral methotrexate as \nfirst- or subsequent -line treatment of ECD was evaluated in a \nretrospective study conducted at an NCCN Member Institution (N = \n13).126 Oral methotrexate was administered either alone or in \ncombination with prednisone or infliximab and was associated with a clinical ORR of 23% (all PRs). Progressive disease occurred in 70%. \nDespite the low ORR, methotrexate -based treatment was well -tolera ted, \nand response was durable in some of those who responded to the \ntreatment, especially those with ocular ECD. Finally, two small single-center studies showed good efficacy with the IL -1 receptor antagonist \nanakinra as a treatment option for ECD.\n127,128 \nAs with LCH,  other  targeted therapies  can also be selected  for patients \nwith ECD based on the respective molecular alteration. Crizotinib, \nalectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, and lorlatinib  are options for patients with \nALK rearrangements while selpercatinib is recommended for ECD with \nrearrangements in RET .53,129 Pexidartinib for ECD with activating \nmutations in CSF1R , and larotrectinib,  entrectinib, repotrectinib for ECD \nwith NTRK  fusions, are all reasonable systemic therapy options when \nclinically indicated.53,83 -86,130 Since mutations in PIK3CA are fairly \ncommon in ECD7, mTOR inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus \nshould also be considered when clinically indicated.87 Of note,  lower \ndoses are to  be considered upon starting targeted agents.  \nFollow -up \nSimilar to  LCH, follow- up assessment for patients with ECD depends on \nextent of disease and organ involvement. FDG -PET/CT should be used \nto monitor disease response once treatment is initiated. Organ -specific \ncross- sectional imaging (CT or MRI) should also be utilized, and \nongoing evaluation for pituitary hormone abnormalities should be incorporated . Regular skin examination and ECG is recommended for \npatients treated with BRAF inhibitors  with regular skin and retinal \nexamination and ECG also being recommended for patients treated \nwith MEK inhibitors. For further information, see Follow- up for ECD  in \nthe algorithm . \nRosai- Dorfman Disease \nRDD is another rare histiocytic disorder that mainly affects children but \nis also diagnosed in adults.

It is a heterogeneous \ncondition with a presentation that may be classified as single or regional \nlymph node -involved or localized to the skin and other organs. \nPrognosis is generally very good but becomes worse as the number of \ninvolved nodal groups increases.132 Recurrent disease is reported to \noccur in about one in three patients with RDD.133 \nExtranodal involvement occurs often in RDD, with common sites of \ninvolvement including the skin, soft tissue, upper respiratory tract, \nmultifocal bone (mostly osteolytic lesions), retroperitoneum, and \neye/retro -orbital tissue with lymphadenopathy.3,132,133 Bilateral massive \ncervical lymphadenopathy also commonly occurs and is often painless, though involvement of the mediastinal, inguinal, and axillary lymph \nnodes may also occur.\n132 Skin-involved RDD often presents as \nsubcutaneous masses and, less often, as cutaneous lesions.133 \nInvolvement of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and parotid gland \nhave also been reported.24,132,134 CNS involvement may also occur but \nis generally rare.132,133,135,136 CNS -involved RDD may mimic \nmeningioma.132 \nRDD may co -occur with Hodgkin and non- Hodgkin lymphoma, other \nhistiocytic disorders, cutaneous clear -cell sarcoma, and following \nmyelodysplastic syndrome and allogeneic stem transplant for precursor \nB-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.24,132,133 Germline mutations in \nSLC29A3, which is associated with Faisalabad histiocytosis, H syndrome, and pigmented hypertrichotic dermatosis with insulin-\ndependent diabetes, have been found in cases of familial RDD.\n132 About 20% of patients with H syndrome have RDD.137 Germline \nmutation in the FAS gene TNFRS F, which is associated with \nautoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) type I, has also been \nfound in RDD cases.132 Immunologic diseases associated with RDD \ninclude systemic lupus erythematous, idiopathic juvenile arthritis, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\n132 \nDiagnosis of RDD  \nDiagnosis of RDD in volves  a clinical and radiologic examination, as well \nas histopathologic analysis. Essential workup  for RDD includes a \ncomprehensive H&P with special  attention to the common sites of \ninvolvement: peripheral lymphadenopathy, subcutaneous nodules, and \nextranodal sites (skin [ HEENT ], soft tissue, upper respiratory tract, \nbone, retroperitoneum, orbits, and spleen).  Evaluation of the endocrine \nsystem and  any intrathoracic/pulmonary, cardiovascular, \ngastrointestinal, musculoskeletal genital, renal, and cutaneous symptoms  is recommended.  Neurologic and psychological assessment s \nare also encouraged as needed. History of inherited conditions predisposing to RDD (eg, ALPS), malignancies and other neoplasia \nassociated with RDD (eg, Hodgkin and non- Hodgkin lymphoma, other \nhistiocytic disorders), and other autoimmune disorders (eg, systemic \nlupus erythematous, idiopathic juvenile arthritis) should be evaluated \nbased on clinical symptoms and family history.  Family history should \nalso be considered if parents are consanguineous , possess an \nautoimmune disease, or are of Turkish/Pakistani or Middle Eastern \nancestry.  \nFull-body FDG -PET/CT is also recommended as part of the baseline \nevaluation of RDD. A single- center retrospective study including 109 \nFDG -PET/CT scans in 27 patients with RDD showed that PET/CT \ndetected lesions not recognized by anatomic cross -sectional imaging in \n30% of patients with available prior CT or MRI (n = 20).\n138 Results of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:43:45 PM.

Imaging studies should be performed with \ncontrast unless contrast is contraindicated. PFTs and TTE may be needed in the event of pulmonary RDD. Thyroid and testicular US can \nalso be performed if clinically indicated. Like  LCH and ECD, \ndermatology and ophthalmology evaluations should be considered in appropriate patients due to toxicities associated with BRAF and MEK \ninhibitors.\n11-13 The complete recommendations for evaluation of RDD \nare provided in the algorithm and are adapted from recommendations from an expert consensus group\n132 (see Rosai -Dorfman Disease : \nWorkup/Evaluation in the algorithm.  \nAdditionally, l aboratory evaluation should be included in the essential \nworkup with CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies, \nand an evaluation of C -reactive protein, uric acid, LDH, and serum \nimmunoglobulins  being recommended.132 If autoimmune disease is \nsuspected based on clinical examination, then laboratory evaluation should also include antinuclear antigen, antineutrophil cytoplasmic \nantibodies, rheumatoid factor, and HLA -B27. The ALPS panel is clinically indicated in patients with autoimmunity and lymphadenopathy. \nLaboratory evaluation in patients with anemia should include a Coombs \ntest, haptoglobin, reticulocyte count, and blood smear. Lumbar puncture \nshould be carried out if there are brain l esions that cannot be biopsied \ndue to location. If a patient has an unexplained, abnormal CBC, bone \nmarrow aspirate and biopsy are recommended.\n132 As with LCH and \nECD, biopsy of tumor tissue is recommended  for diagnosis and \nmolecular  testing (both IHC and NGS ).110 If biopsy is not feasible, then \nperipheral blood analysis is reasonable. The  minimum  IHC panel  \nperformed should include : CD68 or CD163, S100, CD1a, and cyclin D1; \nhowever, caution should be applied to cyclin D1 as it could also be \ndetected in concurrent lymphocytic or histiocytic neoplasm.  BRAF  \nV600E (VE1) IHC should also be included in the analysis . NGS of tumor \ntissue should evaluate mutations in the MAPK pathway  and other \nrelated pathways . Gene fusion assay s should also be performed while \ngermline mutation testing is optional in these patients.

Even though some of these mutations (eg, BRAF V600E ) are \nless common in RDD, a comprehensive panel test is helpful for \ndistinguishing RDD from other histiocytic neoplasms. Germline testing \nfor SLC29A3, if familial RDD is suspected, and TNFRS F should also be \nconsidered if clinically indicated.  Complete recommendations regarding \npathologic analysis of RDD cases  can be found in the Principle s of \nPathology  in the algorithm . \nTreatment of RDD  \nObservation is a reasonable treatment strategy for patients with \nasymptomatic and mild RDD, as spontaneous remission has been \nreported to occur in 40% of these patients.132,133 Surg ical resection is \nalso a reasonable curative option for those with isolated disease or for \nthe debulking of symptomatic disease of the CNS, sinuses, or \nairways.132,133 Patients with extranodal disease impacting critical organs \nand those with serious RDD -related complications require treatment  \nwith systemic therapies (see below) . RT should only be used for \npalliative purposes in patients with multifocal symptomatic disease.132 \nCase reports have shown some efficacy for RT when used to treat \nrefractory disease in the eyelid and soft tissue of the cheek,144 as well as RDD lesions causing airway obstruction.145 RT dosing for RDD is not \nwell-established, but 30 to 50 Gy may be used.132,145 \nSystemic Therapy  \nSystemic therapy is recommended for first -line treatment of \nsymptomatic unresectable or multifocal disease and for treatment of \nrelapsed/refractory disease. There is a dearth of research in this area, \nand some systemic therapy options that may be used for treating RDD \nare extrapolated from ECD.133 Preferred regimens for the treatment of \nRDD include cobimetinib for patients with MAP kinase pathway \nmutation, no other detectable/actionable mutation, or if testing is not \navailable. Cladribine, cytarabine, oral methotrexate, and prednisone or other corticosteroids are also preferred  regimens irrespective of \nmutation.  \nCobimetinib was evaluated in a study of 16 patients with RDD,  the \nlargest reported series of patients with RDD to date,  50% of whom had \neither detectable KRAS or MEK  somatic alterations . Positive outcomes  \nwere observed with cobimetinib in this cohort,  most notably  in those \nwith demonstrated KRAS - or MEK -variant RDD.\n146 Patients with genetic \nalterations in KRAS or MEK  had a significantly enhanced ORR (88% vs . \n38%)  and PFS at 1 year (100% vs . 29%) as well as deeper responses \n(71% complete responses vs . 0%) compared to those without these \nalterations.146  \nA retrospective study, conducted at Mayo Clinic (N = 57), revealed that \ncorticosteroid treatment (most often prednisone) was associated with a 56% ORR in the first -line setting,  with relapse occurring in 53% of \npatients, and a 67% ORR in the subsequent -line setting.\n133 This study \nalso showed that cladribine was the most commonly used systemic \ntherapy for treatment of recurrent disease and was associated with a \n67% ORR.133,147 Case reports support use of cytarabine and oral \nmethotrexate for treatment of RDD.148- 151 A case report describing PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:43:45 PM.

Evidence supporting use of \ntargeted agents for RDD is evolving, particularly for MEK inhibitors, and \nsome options may be used based on extrapolation of evidence for use \nin ECD and LCH. The MEK inhibitor trametinib is an option, regardless \nof molecular prof ile, including in those without BRAF  V600E \nmutations .\n116,155    \nPrednisone combined with vinblastine is also supported by a case \nreport describing treatment of a pediatric patient with RDD,156 but this \nregimen is associated with increased risk of neuropathy in adults.77 \nOptimal duration of steroid treatment is unknown at this time; treating to \noptimal response, followed by a slow taper, is a reasonable strategy.132 \nAdverse effects from steroids should be carefully monitored, though these are generally well -tolerated.\n133 Additionally, two case  studies  demonstrated that lenalidomide was potentially effective in treating \npatients with RDD that had received previous therapy.157,158  \nJust as with LCH and ECD, targeted systemic therapy options   may be \nrecommended in certain circumstances .53,83 -85 These include: crizotinib \nfor ALK rearrangements, selpercatinib for RET  rearrangements, \npexidartinib for activating mutations in CSF1R , larotrectinib, \nrepotrectinib, and entrectinib for NTRK  fusions, everolimus for PIK3CA \nmutations, and sirolimus for those associated with ALPS and/ or \nPIK3CA mutation.53,83- 86,159 Rituximab and thalidomide may also be \nuseful irrespective of mutation for IgG4- related nodal and immune-\ncytopenia disease or for cutaneous involvement, respectively.151,160 For \nmore information on systemic therapy options for RDD treatment , see \nHIST -D 4 of 6 Principles of Systemic Therapy for RDD  in the algorithm.  \nFollow -up \nAs with LCH and ECD, follow- up assessment for patients with RDD \ndepends on extent of disease and organ involvement  and includes post -\ntreatment surveillance and imaging of involved sites .

Therefore, for patients \nwithout CNS involvement it may be reasonable to start at half the \napproved dose and then modify the dose over time based on tolerance \nand toxicities. These drugs can lead to cutaneous toxicities, such as the \nacneiform rash that can occur with MEK inhibitors.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nHistiocytic Neoplasms   \n \nMS-20 \nan increased risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with BRAF \ninhibitor use. Therefore, routine dermatologic examination is \nrecommended. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may also be poorly tolerated \nat full doses , and i t may be reasonable to start with one or two dose \nreductions and then adjust the dose based on response.  \nSeparate from drug toxicities, patients often have other quality of life \nissues related to chronic pain, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. Patients \nwith histiocytic disorders (especially ECD and LDH) often struggle with \nchronic generalized pain and fatigue that is out of proportion to the \ndisease involvement. The oral stimulant methylphenidate can be used and appears safe for the long- term use in patients with cases of severe \nfatigue. Many of these patients  also fit the criteria for myalgic \nencephalomyeliti s/chronic fatigue syndrome. Also, some patients have \nresidual pain at the site of a tumor bed despite complete resection (especially in the case of bone lesions from LCH)  and much of the \nchronic pain may not respond well to available analgesics . There is a \nhigh prevalence of depression and anxiety that compounds these \nsymptoms further. All of which can worsen the health- related quality of \nlife of these patients significantly. It is important for clinicians to acknowledge these symptoms fully and r efer the patients to appropriate \nsupportive care services . Depending on the specific manifestations of \ntheir disease, patients should also continue to closely follow up with \ntheir pulmonary/neurology/endocrinology specialist during surveillance.  \nSummary  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Histiocytic Neoplasms provide an evidence-\nand consensus -based approach for the diagnosis and treatment of adult \nhistiocytic neoplasms , which are relatively rare heterogeneous  \nhematologic disorders . LCH, ECD, and RDD are  the most common , but \nthese diseases, given their rarity, overlap, and co -occurrence with other \ntypes of neoplasms , pose a diagnostic challenge.  Appropriate diagnosis  is necessary  to achieve the best clinical outcomes  with \nimmunophenotyping and molecular marker profiling being critical  \ncomponents  to differential diagnosis . Additionally, molecular testing \nprovides guidance on  the most  effective  systemic therapy options  with \nmany patients having complete recoveries. R esearch continues to \nimprove therapeutic approaches, especially to in the context of targeting abnormal cells while simultaneously sparing normal tissue,  and the \nNCCN Panel continues to encourage patients to participate in well -\ndesigned clinical trials in order to enable future advancement for \nmanagement of these diseases.
