Ovarian removal is \nnot necessary.\n• Lung metastasis can be a site of chemotherapy-resistant disease. For these highly selected patients, resection of pulmonary metastasis can \nimprove cure rates.\n• Craniotomy can be considered in rare cases of GTN with brain metastases, including active intracranial hemorrhage, raised intracranial \npressure, and impending cerebral herniation. \nGTN-CPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:51 PM.

All patients, whether sexually active or not, should be asked \nabout genitourinary symptoms, including vulvovaginal dryness. Referral to appropriate specialty providers (eg, physical therapy , pelvic floor therapy, \nsexual therapy, psychotherapy) is recommended. As most treatments for gynecologic cancers will cause sexual dysfunction, early menopause, and \ninfertility, special attention to the resultant medical and psychosocial implications is needed.  \n• Post-radiation use of vaginal dilators and moisturizers is recommended.\n• For treatment-related menopause, hormone therapy should be considered.\n• Communication and coordination with all clinicians involved in the care of survivors, including primary care clinicians, is critical. Providing cancer \nsurvivors with a summary of their treatment and recommendations for follow-up is recommended.  \n• In subsequent pregnancy: \n\u0017Recommend early ultrasound to confirm intrauterine pregnancy\n\u0017Perform pathologic evaluation of placenta\n\u0017Check hCG at 6 weeks postpartum to confirm return to negative\nAdditional Guidance  \n• NCCN Guidelines for Distress Management\n• NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation\n• NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship\nGTN-EPhysical Effects \n• Gynecologic cancer treatment typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation therapy (RT), and/or immunotherapy. These treatments \ncause acute, short-term, and long-term toxicities.  \n• Surgical approaches may be extensive and pose risks such as adhesion formation, which may cause pain and may contribute to small bowel obstruction, \nurinary or gastrointestinal complications (eg, incontinence, diarrhea), pelvic floor dysfunction (manifested by a variety of urinary , bowel, and/or sexual \neffects), and lymphedema.  \n• Chemotherapy agents vary, though commonly used regimens may pose a significant risk of neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, development of hematologic \ncancers, and cognitive dysfunction. \n• Long-term estrogen deprivation may cause symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and bone loss.  \n• RT may cause long-term complications (eg, fibrosis, vulvovaginal atrophy) and may predispose patients to secondary cancers of the subcutaneous tissue, \nand/or underlying organs that are proximal to the radiation field. \n• Prior pelvic RT may contribute to bone loss and increase the risk of pelvic fractures. Consider bone density testing and prophylactic use of \nbisphosphonates, particularly in patients with osteoporosis.\n• Immunotherapy use is emerging, and to date, long-term effects of these treatments are unknown.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nGestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia  \n \nMS-2 Overview \nGestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) refers to a group of benign and \nmalignant tumors that develop in the uterus from placental tissue. The \npathogenesis  of GTD is unique in that maternal tumors arise from \ngestational tissue that can have locally invasive or metastatic potential. Historical data on incidence of GTD varies widely by region, with higher \nincidence reported in Asia compared with Europe and Nor th America. \nThese differences are thought to be due at least in part to varying diagnostic criteria, reporting practices, quality of epidemiologic data, and \ndiet and nutrition. In the United States, the reported incidence of GTD is \napproximately 1 out of every 1000 pregnancies.\n1-4  \nThe most common form of GTD is hydatidiform mole (HM), also known as \nmolar pregnancy. HMs are considered a benign, premalignant disease. \nMalignant forms of GTD are collectively referred to as gestational \ntrophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), and include invasive mole, \nchoriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT), and epithelioid \ntrophoblastic tumor (ETT). HM encompasses about 80% of all GTD, \ninvasive moles account for 15%, and choriocarcinoma and other rarer \ntypes of GTN comprise the remaining 5%.5 Cure rates are approaching \n100%, and treatment typically allows for fertility preservation.5,6 \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN  \nGuidelines are available at  www.NCCN.org .  \nLiterature Search Criteria \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN  Clinical Practice Guidelines \n(NCCN Guidelines®) for Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia, an electronic \nsearch of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature in GTD  published since the previous Guidelines update, using the following \nsearch terms: gestational trophoblastic OR choriocarcinoma OR intermediate trophoblastic tumor . The PubMed database was chosen as it \nremains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-review ed biomedical literature.   \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; \nGuideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta -Analysis; Systematic \nReviews; and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sourc es deemed as relevant to these G uidelines as discussed by the \nPanel during the Guidelines update have been included in this version of \nthe Discussion section. Recommendations for which high- level evidence \nis lacking are based on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and \nexpert opinion.   \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist , and anti -fat-biased; and inclusive of \nindividuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclus ive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sou rces that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:51 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nGestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia  \n \nMS-3 present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nTypes of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease  \nHM occurs as a result of abnormal fertilization and is characterized as \ncomplete or partial based on differences in morphology, karyotype, and \nmalignant potential. The majority of complete moles (80%) occur as a \nresult of abnormal fertilization of an ovum lacking nuclear DNA and  have \ntwo identical paternal chromosome complements derived from duplication of the haploid genome of a single sperm. The remaining 20% occur as a \nresult of dispermy (fertilization by two sperm s). Partial moles occur when \nan ovum ret ains its nucleus and abnormal fertilization occurs in one of two \nways: 1) fertilization by a single sperm with subsequent paternal \nchromosome duplication; or 2) via dispermy. Partial HMs can contain fetal \ntissue, but complete moles do not. More information on the pathologic \ndiagnosis of benign, noninvasive HM  can be found in the principle of \npathology section of the guidelines.  \nPost-molar GTN, which includes invasive mole and choriocarcinoma, \ndevelops in about 15% to 20% of complete moles, but in only 1% to 5% of \npartial moles.\n2,3,7,8 The reported incidence of GTN after molar pregnancy is \n18% to 29%.2,3,9,10 This rate appears to be stable despite the progressively \nearlier diagnosis of complete HM.10 Invasive moles arise from extension of \nHM into the myometrium via tissue or venous channels. Approximately \n15% of invasive moles metastasize to the lung or vagina. Persistent \nelevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) after evacuation of a molar \npregnanc y most often leads to the diagnosis of invasive mole.2 \nChoriocarcinoma develops from villous trophoblast. Features of these \nmalignant epithelial tumors include abnormal trophoblastic hyperplasia \nand anaplasia, hCG production, absence of chorionic villi, hemorrhage, and necrosis.2,3 Choriocarcinoma has been reported to occur with different \ntypes of pregnancy events, including HM (50%), term or preterm gestation \n(25%), and tubal pregnancy or abortion (25%). Approximately 2% to 3% of \nHMs progress to choriocarcinoma.  \nIntermediate trophoblastic tumors  (ITT), including PSTT and ETT,  are rare \nsubtypes of GTN with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 pregnancies, \nrepresenting approximately 1% of all GTN cases.11 Most PSTTs follow \nnonmolar gestations and present months to years after the antecedent \npregnancy. Less often, PSTT develops after evacuation of HM.5 PSTT \narises from interstitial trophoblast at the placental implantation site and \nconsists predominately of mononuclear intermediate trophoblast without \nchorionic villi,  infiltrating in s heets or cords between myometri al fibers. It is \nassociated with less vascular invasion, necrosis , and hemorrhage than \nchoriocarcinoma.   \nETT is a rare variant of PSTT that simulates carcinoma. Based on \nmorphologic and histochemical features, it appears to develop from \nneoplastic transformation of chorionic -type intermediate trophoblast . ETT \ntypically presents years after term delivery . \nHydatidiform Mole \nPresentation and Workup  \nPatients with HM commonly present with vaginal bleeding, typically around \n6 to 16 weeks of gestation. Due to widespread ultrasound screening \nduring early pregnancy and accurate hCG testing, most cases of HM are \ndetected prior to the onset of additional signs such as uterine enlargement \nbeyond that expected for gestation date, preeclampsia, hyperemesis, \nanemia, and theca lutein ovarian cysts.2,3,5 Partial HMs tend to grow more \nslowly and may present later in the first or early second trimester, often \nwith symptoms of incomplete or missed abortion and diagnosis made \nupon histologic examination of the curettage specimen.2,3 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:51 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nGestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia  \n \nMS-4 Initial determination of suspected HM is often made based on ultrasound \nfindings in combination with clinical symptoms and hCG levels. Due to \nhyperplastic trophoblastic cells in complete HM, many patients will have \nmarked elevations in hCG, at times >100,000 IU/L. However, such \nelevations in hCG are observed in < 10% of patients with partial HM. \nCharacteristic ultrasound findings of complete HM include enlarged uterus \nwith a heterogenous mass (ie, snowstorm appearance). Hydropic/swollen \nchorionic villi lead to the appearance of small cystic spaces, creating a \nvesicular pattern. However, these characteristics may not be readily \nobserved with the diagnosis of HM early in the first trimester. As molar \npregnancy advances, these cystic spaces become larger and mor e \nnumerous. Features that may be noted on ultrasound imaging of partial HM include focal cystic spaces within the placenta, gestational sac that is \nempty or elongated along the transverse axis , and/or fetal anomalies or \nfetal demise.\n2,3,5,9,12 The NCCN Panel recommends workup of patients with \nHM to include history and physical; pelvic ultrasound; quantitative hCG \nassay; complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count; liver, renal, and \nthyroid function tests; as well as blood type and screen (administer Rho [D] \nimmune globulin if Rh- negative). Recommended imaging also includes \nchest x -ray. If chest x -ray is positive for metastases,  perform \nchest/abdomen/pelvis (C/A/P)  CT with contrast and brain MRI  with or \nwithout contrast ; manage as GTN after ini tial uterine evacuation.  \nTreatment  \nInitial treatment of HM in patients  who wish to preserve fertility is suction \ndilation and curettage (D&C), preferably performed under ultrasound \nguidance to reduce the risk of uterine perforation.9,13 To reduce the risk of \nheavy bleeding, uterotonic agents (eg, m ethylergonovine and/or \nprostaglandins) should be administered during the procedure and \ncontinued for several hours postoperatively.2,14 Tranexamic acid (TXA) can \nbe considered if necessary. For patients  who do not wish to preserve \nfertility, hysterectomy with salpingectomy can be considered as an alternative.15 Histopathologic review and DNA genotyping help confirm the \ndiagnosis of benign, noninvasive HM,16 and may allow patients at low risk \nfor developing post -molar GTN (ie, those with partial HM) to avoid \nunnecessary treatment with prophylactic chemotherapy.17 \nProphylactic chemotherapy at the time of uterine evacuation is \ncontroversial and may reduce the incidence of post -molar GTN by 3% to \n8%. A Cochrane database review (three randomized controlled trials [RCTs], n = 613) did not conclude sufficient evidence fo r standard \nadministration of prophylactic chemotherapy to prevent post -molar GTN; \nhowever, evidence was suggestive that prophylactic chemotherapy may \nreduce the risk of progression to GTN among patients  with complete HM \nat high risk for malignant transform ation.\n18 The NCCN Guidelines state \nthat prophylactic methotrexate or dactinomycin can be considered for \npatients deemed at high risk for post -molar GTN (eg, age >40 years, hCG \nlevels in excess of 100,000 mIU/mL, excessive uterine enlargement, and/or theca lutein cysts >6 cm ).\n2,9,18,19 \nFollow -up \nFollow -up with hCG monitoring is essential following initial treatment of \nHM to ensure that hCG levels return to normal. The hCG molecules \nassociated with GTD are more heterogenous and degraded than those \nassociated with normal pregnancy.2,20 Therefore, monitoring should be \nperformed with a quantitative assay capable of detecting all forms of hCG, \nincluding beta- hCG, core hCG, nicked -free beta, beta core, and \nhyperglycosylated forms.5,21,22 Post-molar GTN develops in about 15% to \n20% of complete moles, but in only 0.1% to 5% of partial moles. \nTherefore, careful monitoring can facilitate early detection of persistent \nGTN.  Risk of recurrence is low (<2%) following a single molar pregnancy, \nbut increases significantly for patients  who experience one or more \nrecurrences.2,3,7,13,14,23 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:51 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nGestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia  \n \nMS-5 Once normalized, recurrent elevation of hCG has been reported in <1% of \npatients.23,24 The occurrence of GTN following hCG normalization is rare \nafter the recommended 6 months of post -normalization hCG monitoring.25 \nA 2018 study showed that patients with complete HM who normalized \nbeyond 56 days post uterine evacuation had a 3.8- fold higher risk of \ndeveloping post -molar GTN.23 \nThe NCCN Panel recommends hCG assay monitoring every 1 to 2 weeks \nuntil levels have normalized, defined in the guidelines as three \nconsecutive normal assays. Patients should also use contraception; o ral \ncontraceptive pills are preferred over intrauterine devices because they \nsuppress endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle- stimulating \nhormone (FSH ), which may interfere with hCG measurement at low levels  \nand is preferred for at least 6 months . Following initial normalization, \nconsider hCG measure ment  every 3 months for 6 months to ensure levels \nremain normal. If hCG levels remain persistently elevated (ie, plateau or \nrise), treat per the persistent post-molar GTN algorithm.  \nPost -Molar GTN  \nPost-molar GTN is typically diagnosed by hCG  surveillance. The NCCN \nGuidelines use the FIGO staging criteria for post -molar GTN as meeting \none of more of the following criteria after treatment for HM, as indicated by \nhCG monitoring26 and WHO prognostic scoring index for GTN27: \n• hCG levels plateau for 4 consecutive values over 3 weeks  \n• hCG levels rise ≥10% for 3 values over  2 weeks  \nAssessment and staging of post -molar GTN should include history and \nphysical examination (including pelvic exam), FIGO stage and prognostic \nscore, pelvic ultrasound, and imaging (chest x -ray or [C/A/P] CT to assess \nfor metastatic disease. Pelvic  ultrasound is used to confirm the absence of \npregnancy, measure uterine size, and to delineate the volume and \nvasculature of the tumor. If chest x -ray reveals no evidence of metastatic disease, no further imaging is recommended prior to treatment. If the \nchest x -ray suggests  metastases, C/A/P CT scan with contrast and brain \nMRI with or without are indicated.  Post-treatment imaging is not routinely \nrecommended for follow -up after hCG normalization in patients with post -\nmolar GTN or choriocarcinoma, where hCG is a reliable tumor marker. It \nmay be necessary to follow patients with brain metastases with MRI brain \nwith contrast for 2 to 3 years.  \nRepeat D&C  for all patients with WHO ≤4, hysterectomy with \nsalpingectomy, or single- agent systemic therapy can be considered for \npersistent post -molar GTN with no evidence of extrauterine disease.28-30 \nAn observational study conducted over a period of 10 years examined 544 \npatients  who underwent second uterine evacuation for persistent GTD.30 \nFollowing repeat curettage, 68% had no further evidence of disease or \nchemotherapy requirements. However, chemotherapy requirement was \nmore likely for patients with a histologic confirmation of persistent \ntrophoblastic disease and for urinary hCG levels i n excess of 1500 IU/L at \ntime of second evacuation.30 Several groups have discussed the optimal \ncharacteristics of candidates for repeat uterine evacuation.30-34 Repeat \nsurgical treatment or single- agent systemic therapy should be followed by \nhCG monitoring every 2 weeks until the patient has 3 consecutive normal \nassays, followed by monthly hCG monitoring for 6  to 12 months. For \npersistent hCG elevation (ie, plateau or rise), follow GTN chemotherapy recommendations, which are stratified by patient response to initial \ntherapy and the magnitude of hCG elevation.  \nFor presence of metastatic disease, histopathologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma,  PSTT/ETT  or extrauterine disease, follow \nrecommendations for staging and treatment in the algorithms for GTN, \nwhich are stratified by risk group/prognostic score.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nGestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia  \n \nMS-6 Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia \nPresentation and Workup   \nThe presentation of GTN can vary depending upon the antecedent \npregnancy event and disease type and extent. Post -molar GTN, including \ninvasive mole or choriocarcinoma, can be associated with irregular bleeding after initial treatment for molar pregnancy, an enlarged and \nirregular uterus, and bilateral ovarian enlargement. However, these signs \nmay be absent in patients with choriocarcinoma associated with normal, \nnon-molar pregnancies. Trophoblastic tumors have fragile vessels and as \na result, metastatic les ions are often hemorrhagic. In addition to bleeding, \nmetastatic lesions may be associated with neurologic or pulmonary \nsymptoms. ETT and PSTT typically present with irregular uterine bleeding \narising after some time has passed from a previous pregnancy.\n2,3,35 \nWorkup for GTN includes history and physical examination and metastatic \nimaging workup, to include C/A/P CT scan with contrast (or MRI if contrast \nis contraindicated)  as well as  brain MRI (preferred) with or without contrast \nor CT  with contrast  if pulmonary metastasis . Pelvic ultrasound or MRI with \nor without contrast should also be performed. Visible lesions in the lower genital tract should not be biopsied due to hemorrhage risk. Additionally, \nthe NCCN Panel recommends repeat CBC differential with platelets; liver, \nrenal, and thyroid function testing; and hCG assay. If hCG is elevated with \nno evidence of disease on imaging, consider the possibility of LH \ncrossover or phantom hCG.\n36,37 If hCG is elevated, although at a low level \nthat is stable over time (and false positive hCG ruled out), quiescent GTN \nis possible, and close follow -up, rather than immediate treatment may be \nconsidered.  Based on these findings, GTN should be staged and scored \naccording to the current FIGO staging and prognostic scoring system.26,38 \nGTN staging is based on tumor location and extent: stage I disease is uterine- confined, stage II involves direct extension or metastasis to other \ngenital structures, stage III disease is determined by lung metastasis, and stage IV disease includes non- pulmonary distant metastasis. The current FIGO prognostic scoring system was adapted from the WHO \nclassification, which incorporated prognostic factors from Bagshawe’s \nscoring system.\n39,40 FIGO prognostic scoring is based on individual risk \nfactors that have been shown to be predictive of GTN that is resistant to \nsingle -agent chemotherapy, such as age, antecedent pregnancy, interval \nfrom index pregnancy, pretreatment hCG, largest tumor size  (including the \nuterus), site and number of metastases, and previous chemotherapy \nregimens that were unsuccessful. The sum of individual scores denotes \nthe FIGO prognostic score of low -risk GTN (<7) or high- risk GTN \n(≥7).26,38,41 This prognostic scoring system is not valid for the ITTs ETT and \nPSTT.11 \nHistopathologic assessment is also recommended by the Panel as part of \ninitial workup. The immunohistochemical (IHC) markers melanoma cell \nadhesion molecule (Mel-CAM/CD146), human placental lactogen  (hPL), \nbeta- human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), p63, cyclin E, and Ki -67 are \nall differentially expressed between PSTT, ETT, and \nchoriocarcinoma.16,42,43 GATA- 3 is a sensitive marker for both benign and \nmalignant trophoblast proliferations, and may be useful in distinguishing \nGTN from non -GTN tumors. Given that recommended treatment regimens \nfor each of these GTN subtypes differ significantly, accurate diagnosis is essential for avoiding unnecessary treatment and optimizing patient \noutcomes.  \nLow-Risk GTN  \nFirst -Line Therapy  \nAs noted above, low -risk GTN is defined as a FIGO prognostic score of \n<7. Standard first -line treatment for low -risk GTN is single -agent \nchemotherapy using methotrexate or dactinomycin. Numerous studies \nhave evaluated these agents, but differences in inclusion criteria and \ndosage regimens have made it challenging to determine a superior \nregimen.

A closed phase III RCT ( NCT01535053 ) comparing pulse \ndactinomycin to multiday methotrexate regimens noted primary remission \nrates of 75% for pulse dactinomycin versus 88.5% for the multiday \nmethotrexate regimens (5- day > 8 -day). Overall quality -of-life scores were \nsimilar. Alopecia was more  common with dactinomycin, mucositis was \nmore common with the methotrexate regimens, and no patient required \nmultiagent chemotherapy or salvage surgery to reach remission.46  \nCurrently supported regimens of dactinomycin include a 5- day regimen \n(10–12 mcg/kg or flat 0.5 mg dose IV  push , repeated every 2 weeks) or a \ndactinomycin pulse regimen (1.25 mg/m2, IV push, repeated every 2 \nweeks).21 Primary remission rates for initial treatment with 5 -day \ndactinomycin range from 77%  to 94%, and for pulse dactinomycin, from \n69% to 90%.41 For methotrexate, currently supported regimens include 5 -\nday methotrexate (0.4 mg/kg IV push or IM daily x 5 days, repeated every \n2 weeks) or an 8 -day regimen of methotrexate alternating with leucovorin \nrescue (1.0– 1.5 mg/kg IM, every other day x 4 days, alternating with \nleucovorin, 15 mg PO, repeated every 2 weeks).21 Primary remission rates \nfor multiday methotrexate regimens range from 87% to 93% for the 5- day \nprotocol, and from 74% to 93% for 8 -day methotrexate with leucovorin \nrescue.41 Both methotrexate and dactinomycin are category 1 preferred \nregimens for low -risk GTN.  Methotrexate regimens that are no longer recommended due to lesser \nefficacy include weekly IM methotrexate (30– 50 mg/m2) and pulse- dose IV \ninfusion methotrexate.41,47,48 Although weekly IM methotrexate was \nsuccessful in 70% of patients with a prognostic score of 0– 1, the success \nrate fell to 40% and 12% with a prognostic score of 2– 4 and 5– 6, \nrespectively.5,47 In a large case series (n = 618), 8- day methotrexate was \ncomparatively more successful when analyzed by prognostic score \nsubgrouping.17 \nThe Guidelines note that a multiday methotrexate regimen is typically used as first -line therapy in low -risk GTN due to its generally favorable toxicity \nprofile. Dactinomycin is often used as a secondary therapy for patients with methotrexate toxicity or effusions contradicting the use of \nmethotrexate. Alternative single- agent options for treatment of low -risk \nGTN that are primarily used in Asia include etoposide and fluorouracil.\n41,49,50  \nMonitoring/Response Assessment During First -Line Therapy  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends monitoring chemotherapy  response by \nhCG assay every 2 weeks, at the start of each treatment cycle.44 Upon \nhCG normalization, continuation of therapy is recommended for two to \nthree additional treatment cycles past normalization to minimize the risk of \nrecurrence (3-month cycles  is preferred ).3,6,21,51 Surveillance should \ninclude monthly hCG for 1 year, along with contraception (oral \ncontraception preferred). Chemotherapy resistance is indicated by a \nplateau in hCG (<10% change) over three consecutive cycles or a rise in \nhCG (>10% change) over two consecutive cycles.5,44 Second- line \nchemotherapy is then indicated.  \nSecond -Line Single -Agent Therapy  \nCurrently, there are no RCT data on second -line therapy for low -risk GTN, \nbut general evidence and consensus supports a change to the alternative \nsingle -agent chemotherapy for patients who have had a good initial PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:51 PM.

The ovaries are left in situ, even in the presence of theca lutein \ncysts.  \nSecond- line dactinomycin is considered to have an acceptable response \nrate in patients with low levels of hCG, but multiagent chemotherapy may \nbe favored in the second -line setting for patients whose hCG exceeds a \ngiven threshold.17,54,55 The hCG threshold for considering dactinomycin \nversus multiagent regimens has been debated and revised over \ntime.3,17,21,55,56 The NCCN Guidelines note this hCG threshold as 1000 IU/l.  \nDactinomycin has been associated with a complete response rate of \napproximately 75% in large case series of patients with methotrexate -\nresistant GTN.57,58 A retrospective review of 358 patients with low -risk \nGTN identified 68 patients who were determined to have resistant disease after a 5 -day methotrexate regimen (n = 68). The complete response rate \nto secondary dactinomycin was 75%, and all patients who r equired third -\nline multiagent chemotherapy with or without surgery achieved permanent \nremission. Clinicopathologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma (vs. post -molar \nGTN) was significantly associated with resistance to secondary \ndactinomycin.\n57 In a retrospective review of 877 patients with GTN initially \ntreated with 8- day methotrexate, 103 patients required second -line therapy \nand were placed on a 5- day dactinomycin protocol.58 Complete response \nto second -line dactinomycin was observed among 75.7% (n = 78). Among \nthe 25 patients who required third -line treatment for resistant disease or \nrelapse, overall survival was 100%.58 The Guidelines also note that dactinomycin pulse regimen should not be used as secondary therapy for \nmethotrexate- resistant disease nor as primary therapy in patients with \nchoriocarcinoma.   \nSecond -Line Multiagent Therapy  \nFor patients with poor response to single- agent chemotherapy or those \nwho initially responded to initial therapy but experienced a subsequent \nrapid rise in hCG levels  (hCG ≥1000)  or exhibit poor response to initial \ntherapy , repeat disease workup for metastasis , recalculate WHO score \nbased on imaging and transition to combination chemotherapy.3,6 The \nmost commonly used regimen in this setting is EMA/CO (etoposide, \nmethotrexate, and dactinomycin alternating with cyclophosphamide and \nvincristine).17,52,59 The use of EMA/CO in this setting is based upon its \nefficacy in managing high- risk GTN.60 Cure rates with EMA/CO approach \n100% even in the presence of relapsed/resistant low -risk GTN.3,6,59 As with \nsingle -agent second -line therapy, hysterectomy with salpingectomy may  \nalso be considered.  \nMonitoring/Response Assessment During Second- Line Therapy  \nFor both single- agent and multiagent second- line therapy, hCG levels \nshould be monitored every 2 weeks, but a more rapid response \nassessment is warranted if hCG levels plateau or rise. The Panel \nrecommends additional treatment if patients experience an hCG  plateau \nover two consecutive treatment cycles or an hCG rise over 1 cycle . For \npersistent disease after single- agent therapy with or without \nhysterectomy/salpingectomy, repeat workup to assess for metastasis and transition to EMA/CO combination therapy. For persistent or recurrent \ndisease after EMA/CO combination therapy with or without \nhysterectomy/salpingectomy, treat per the high- risk GTN algorithm with \nplatinum -based regimens and surgical resection as feasible.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nGestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia  \n \nMS-9 High -Risk GTN  \nHigh-risk GTN is defined as a prognostic score ≥ 7 or FIGO stage IV \ndisease.26,38 High-risk disease is relatively rare among patients with post -\nmolar GTN, estimated at only 6% (39/618) in a large case series.17 High-\nrisk GTN should be treated with multiagent chemotherapy. Adjuvant \nsurgery or radiation therapy may be included. With a multimodal approach, \ncure rates have reached approximately 90%, including almost all patients \nwith only lung/ vaginal metastases and 70% for patients with stage IV \ndisease.6 Factors associated with poorer outcomes include liver and brain \nmetastases, particularly if co -occurring. However, the prognosis for these \npatients has improved over time.61-63   \nPrimary Chemotherapy  \nEMA/ CO, in which EMA and CO are given on alternate weeks, is the most \ncommonly used  initial regimen for high -risk disease. Based on existing \nevidence, this regimen is thought to provide the best combination of \nefficacy with acceptable toxicity for treating patients with high- risk GTN. \nMultiple groups have confirmed the efficacy of EMA /CO, reporting \ncomplete response rates of 62% to 78% and long -term survival rates of \n85% to 94%.59,60,64- 71  \nReports of other regimens that have been used in first -line treatment of \nhigh- risk GTN include  EMA/EP ( etoposi de, methotrexate, dactinomycin \nalternating with etoposide,  and cisplatin)72,73 and EP/EMA (etoposide  and \ncisplatin  alternating with etoposide,  methotrexate, and dactinomycin ).74 \nDue to the lack of RCTs in this setting, s ystematic reviews have been \nunable to draw conclusions regarding a superior combination regimen for \nprimary treatment of high -risk GTN .52,75 EMA/EP (or EP/EMA) is highly \nactive and considered by some to be superior to EMA/CO for ultra -high-\nrisk disease; however, its use as standard initial therapy is limited by increased toxicity and inability to provide adequate salvage chemotherapy  \nif required for persistent/recurrent disease .5,74  \nInduction Chemotherapy for Extensive Metastatic Disease  \nPatients with widespread metastatic GTN, as evidenced by prognostic \nscore >12, have a poorer prognosis.76,77 Initiation of standard combination \nchemotherapy in these patients can lead to tumor collapse with hemorrhage, metabolic acidosis, septicemia, and/or multiple organ failure, \nresulting in the potential for early death (ie, within 4 weeks).\n21,59,77 Efforts \nto improve outcomes for this ultra- high- risk population have included \ninduction chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin prior to initiating \nEMA/CO.59,77 In a case series of 140 patients with high- risk GTN, 33 \npatients who were determined to have large disease burden (ie, ultra- high-\nrisk GTN) received low -dose induction chemotherapy with \netoposide/cisplatin prior to EMA/CO therapy ( etoposide 100 mg/m² IV and \ncisplatin 20 mg/m ² IV on days 1 and 2,  every 7 days for 1 –3 courses ). \nOverall survival and early death rate were 94.3% and 0.7%, respectively, for the high- risk GTN cohort, representing a considerable improvement \nover outcomes reported for an earlier cohort who did not receive induction \nchemotherapy.\n59 Thus, the Panel recommends considering induction low -\ndose EP ( etoposide 100 mg/m2/day IV and cisplatin 20 mg/m2/day IV ) for \n1–3 cycles prior to EMA/CO treatment.  \nManagement of CNS Metastases  \nAdditional treatment  considerations are recommended for patients with \ncentral nervous system (CNS) metastases, who may require emergency intervention to manage intracranial bleeding or elevated intracranial \npressure.\n5,78 Rates of CNS metastases are low with post -molar GTN, but \napproximately 20% of patients with choriocarcinoma have CNS involvement .\n5,62,78 -82 EMA/CO should be modified to include high- dose \nmethotrexate (1000 mg/m2) and additional 15- mg oral doses of leucovorin PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:51 PM.

Patients who respond to \nprimary chemotherapy but subsequently experience a low -level hCG \nplateau, those who have an incomplete response to prim ary treatment, \nand those who experience relapse from remission require further treatment (ie, salvage chemotherapy and/or adjuvant surgery).  \nSalvage Chemotherapy \nApproximately 30%  to 40%  of patients who are high risk  will have an \nincomplete response to first -line therapy or experience relapse from \nremission.87,88 Most of these patients have multiple metastases to sites \nother than the lung and vagina and many will have received  inadequate \ninitial therapy.89,90 Salvage chemotherapy with drug regimens using \netoposide and a platinum agent, often combined with surgical resection of \npersistent tumor, will result in cure of about 80% to 90% of  patients with \nhigh- risk disease .91  \nEMA/EP or EP/EMA regimens are considered the most appropriate therapy for patients who have responded to EMA/CO but have plateauing \nlow hCG levels or have developed re- elevation of hCG after a complete \nresponse to EMA /CO.\n92,93 The rate of complete response/remission with EMA/EP for disease resistant to EMA/CO has been reported between \n75% and 85%.70,92 -95 \nAdditional drug combinations containing etoposide,  and a platinum agent \nhave been effective in patients who have developed disease resistant to \nmethotrexate- containing regimens. The Panel prefers the use of the \nfollowing four regimens for methotrexate- resistant GTN: TP/TE (paclitaxel \nand cisplatin alternating weekly with paclitaxel and etoposide), BEP \n(bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin), VIP (etoposide, ifosfamide, and \ncisplatin), and ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide).52,91,94,96,97 \nAdditionally, TIP (paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin) has been used as a \nsalvage chemotherapy regimen in germ cell tumors, including those with \nchoriocarcinoma components.98-101  \nEtoposide- platinum –containing regimens require the use of granulocyte \ncolony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) support to prevent neutropenic \ncomplications and treatment delays.91,96,102 The overall success of salvage \ntherapy in this group of patients is about 80%. Factors associated with \nworse survival outcomes include high hCG at the start of salvage therapy, \ngreater number of metastatic sites, metastases to sites other than the lung \nand vagina (stage IV), and FIGO score >12.  \nAdditional Agents/Regimens with Potential Activity in Treatment -\nResistant GTN  \nSeveral additional treatment regimens have been shown to have some \nactivity when treating resistant GTN, including high- dose chemotherapy \n(HDC) with peripheral hematopoietic cell transplant, immunotherapy, and \nother chemotherapy regimens. For a subset of patients with resistant \ndisease despite multidrug chemotherapy, HDC with autologous stem cell \nsupport has been reported to produce sustained complete responses.103-\n107 A retrospective study of 32 patients with refractory choriocarcinoma or \npoor-prognosis PSTT/ETT who underwent HDC with peripheral blood \nstem cell support reported a sustained complete response in 7 /32 patients, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:51 PM.

Durable response to pembrolizumab was observed in three of \nthe four cases. The patient whose disease did not respond to \npembrolizumab had strong PD -L1 tumor expression but an absence of \ntumor -infiltrating lymphocytes.113 Based on these data, the NCCN Panel \nalso added nivolumab, another PD -1 inhibitor, to the list of preferred \nregimens under useful in certain circumstances that may potentially be \neffective against treatment -resistant GTN.  \nAvelumab, a PD -L1 inhibitor, may also be effective against treatment -\nresistant GTN. Results from a phase II study enrolling 15 patients with GTN who experienced disease progression after single- agent \nchemotherapy suggested that avelumab was effective in no rmalizing hCG \nlevels in approximately half of the patients.\n114  \nGemcitabine, capecitabine, and fluorouracil may also have potential for \ntreating GTN in this setting. Limited data have suggested activity of \ngemcitabine, administered with or without a platinum agent.115 Additional \nsupport for the potential activity of these regimens in GTN can  be found in \nthe data for treating germ cell tumors. Successful use of capecitabine as \nsingle -agent salvage chemotherapy has been reported.116,117 Groups in \nAsia have also reported on fluorouracil, primarily in combination with \ndactinomycin.118  Nivolumab and ipilimumab combination is added to the additional Agents/Regimens shown to h ave some activity in treating multiagent \nchemotherapy -resistant GTN  based on Patel SP et al.\n119 In this \nprospective, open -label phase II trial that evaluated ipilimumab plus \nnivolumab across multiple rare tumor cohorts, including GTN , four patients \nwith refractory GTN enrolled and received therapy.  Three of four patients \nachieved ongoing objective responses with a reasonable safety profile at 6  \nto 11+ months.  At 11 months of ongoing follow -up, three  of four patients \nresponded (overall response rate [ ORR]  = 75% [complete response (CR), \n25%, n = 1 , partial response (PR), 50%, n = 2 ]). Responders included \nmalignant GTN  (n = 1, CR, progression- free survival [ PFS]  11+ months) \nand choriocarcinoma (n = 2, both PRs, PFS 10+ and 6+ months). \nIpilimumab plus nivolumab have demonstrated efficacy in chemotherapy -\nrefractory GTN  and is recommended as a systemic therapy option to High-\nRick GTN under Useful in Certain Circumstances.  Following FDA \napproval120 of nivolumab and hyaluronidase for subcutaneous injection \nacross approved adult, solid tumor as monotherapy  and monotherapy \nmaintenance following completion of nivolumab, the NCCN Panel added \nthat nivolumab and hyaluronidase- nvhy  subcutaneous injection may be \nsubstituted for  IV nivolumab. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase- nvhy  has \ndifferent dosing and administration instructions compared to IV nivolumab.  \nAdjuvant Surgery  \nAdjuvant surgical procedures, especially hysterectomy with \nsalpingectomy and pulmonary resection, may be required to manage \nhigh- risk, chemotherapy -resistant disease. Select  patients with isolated \ndisease , especially in the uterus and lungs,  may be candidates for \nsurgical resection.121- 123 PET/CT imaging may be useful for detecting \nisolated metastatic sites that are amenable to targeted surgery.124 \nAdditionally, interventional procedures to prevent or control hemorrhage \nare important components in the management of high -risk GTN.5 \nSelective arterial embolization can be used to manage bleeding from the uterus/vagina or other tumor sites.\n125- 127 In one  case series, nearly 50% PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:51 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nGestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia  \n \nMS-12 of patients with high -risk disease  underwent  some form of surgical \nprocedure during the course of treatment in order to effect cure.128  \nIntermediate Trophoblastic Tumors \nWhereas molar pregnancies and choriocarcinoma are derived from villous \ntrophoblast (ie, cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast), ITTs (including \nPSTT and ETT) develop from extravillous trophoblast (ie, intermediate \ntrophoblast). ITTs comprise approximatel y 1% of GTN cases, and as such, \ntheir biologic behavior and treatment are less  well established. These \ntumors typically develop months to years following normal pregnancies but  \ncan occur after any pregnancy event. A series of 62 cases of ITT suggested that  interval between antecedent pregnancy and disease onset \nmay be longer for ETT than PSTT.\n129 \nPSTT and ETT are generally slow -growing tumors that can metastasize \nmonths or years after initial primary tumor development and often present \nwith abnormal uterine bleeding or amenorrhea.  The vast majority of ITTs \nsecrete hCG, but at significantly lower levels compared with other types of GTN. As such, hCG is a less reliable tumor marker for these subtypes of \nGTN. At diagnosis, metastases are noted in 30% to 50% of cases, most \ncommonly to the lungs. Unlike other GTNs, these have a greater \npropensity  for lym phatic spread. Data are currently being collected in a \nglobal database of PSTTs and ETTs through the efforts of the International Society for the Study of Trophoblastic Disease (ISSTD).\n11,130-\n135   \nITTs can be differentiated from other types of GTN via their \nhistopathologic characteristics.11 In PSTT, IHC  staining reveals the diffuse \npresence of Mel -CAM  (CD146)  and hPL, whereas hCG staining is only \nfocal. Cytogenetic studies have revealed that PSTTs are more often \ndiploid than aneuploid.136 Serum hPL measurements are not clinically \nuseful in monitoring disease course or guiding clinical management.133,134,137,138 ETT is distinguished from PSTT by its smaller, \nfairly  monomorphic cells and a nested, nodular, well -circumscribed growth \npattern. IHC reveals strong expression of p63, but weak expression of \nMel-CAM and hPL.139 Greater than 50% of cells in ETT also express cyclin \nE. It frequently involves the lower uterine segment and endocervix, and \nbecause of its epithelioid histologic appearance and expression of p63, ETT can be confused with squamous cell carcinoma.\n11,139,140 \nDue to the rarity of these tumors, generally small cohort sizes preclude rigorous statistical analysis of risk factors in ITT. The FIGO prognostic \nscoring system for GTN does not correlate well with outcomes in PSTT and ETT.\n11 Based on findings from the largest existing database, PSTT \nand ETT accounted for 125 of 54,743 cases of GTD (0.23%), with post -\ntreatment 5 - and 10- year survival estimates of 80% and 75%, respectively. \nThe most important prognostic factors include advanced disease stage \nand interval from last known pregnancy event of ≥48 months.131,134,135,141 \nAdditional r isk factors associated with less f avorable outcomes are \nadvancing age, deep myometrial invasion, tumor necrosis, large tumor size, and mitotic index.\n11,135,142 \nTreatment Approach  \nITTs are relatively chemoresistant and thus follow a somewhat different \ntreatment paradigm than invasive mole and choriocarcinoma, with surgical intervention playing a more critical role. Treatment of PSTT and ETT is \nmainly determined by presence or absence of metastatic disease , with \nsome consideration given to high- risk factors. The survival rate is \napproximately 100% for nonmetastatic disease and 50% to 60% for \nmetastatic disease. Increased use of platinum -based CT over time has led \nto improved overall s urvival for the subset of patients with ITT who have \nan overall poor prognosis (ie, interval ≥48 months  from last known \npregnancy event).\n131,133- 135 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:51 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nGestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia  \n \nMS-13 Hysterectomy with  salpingectomy, with or without pelvic  lymph node \nbiopsy,  is the recommended treatment for nonmetastatic (stage I)  disease. \nIf the patient has any of the reported poor prognostic factors136 such as ≥ 2 \nyears  interval from index pregnancy, deep myometrial invasion, necrosis \nor increased mitotic count (>5/10 high- power fields), systemic therapy \nregimens need to be considered. In Version 1.2025, the recommendation \nof ≥2 years interval from index pregnancy is changed to ≥ 4 years based \non a study conducted by Froeling et al.135 Of 54,743 patients with GTD \nscreened from the United Kingdom GTD database, 125 (0.23%) were \ndiagnosed with PSTT and/or ETT. Probability of survival at 5 and 10 years \nfollowing treatment was 80% (95% CI , 72.8%–87.6%) and 75% (95% CI , \n66.3% –84.3%), respectively. Of the  five prognostic factors identified from \nUnivariate analysis for reduced overall survival (age, FIGO stage, time \nsince antecedent pregnancy, hCG level, mitotic index) , stage IV disease \nand interval ≥48 months since antecedent pregnancy ( hazard ratio [ HR], \n14.57;  95% CI , 4.17–50.96;  P < .001) were most significant on \nmultivariable analysis. PSTT/ETT with advanced FIGO stage or an interval \n≥48 months from their last known pregnancy have been shown to have \npoorer outcomes  and the Panel changed the prognostic factor to ≥ 4-year \ninterval from index pregnancy. Hysterectomy with salpingectomy and \nchemotherapy are recommended for metastatic disease. M etastasectomy  \n(if feasible) should also be performed for isolated distant disease, \nespecially in the lungs. EMA/EP and EP/EMA and TP /TE are the preferred \nchemotherapy regimens for patients with metastatic disease; other \nrecommended regimens that are effective against treatment -resistant GTN \nsuch as BEP, VIP,  and ICE may also have some efficacy in metastatic \nITTs.  All of these regimens may also be considered for patients with \nnonmetastatic disease who have one or more adverse prognostic factors  \n(ie, interval  from index pregnancy ≥2 years, deep invasion, necrosis, \nmitotic count >5/10 HPFs) .143,144 Additional agents/regimens shown to \nhave some activity in treating multiagent chemotherapy -resistant GTN  \nincluding PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors, capecitabine-  based regimens, gemcitabine with or without cisplatin, high- dose chemotherapy with \nperipheral HCT and nivolumab and ipilimumab combinations are also \nrecommended as useful in other circumstances for ITTs.  \nMonitoring and Surveillance  \nPost-treatment hCG levels should be monitored as indicated for GTN, \nalthough hCG is a less reliable tumor marker for ITTs versus post -molar \nGTN. The Panel recommends surveillance with FDG -PET/CT at the \ncompletion of chemotherapy and then every 6 to 12 months for 2 to 3 years.  \nPost-Treatment Recurrence or Progression of ITTs  \nSystemic therapy regimens recommended for primary treatment of \nmetastatic disease may have some efficacy in patients experiencing recurrence or progression of nonmetastatic or metastatic ITTs. \nAlternatively, patients with metastatic ITTs may forego additional \nchemotherapy and instead receive best supportive care (see NCCN \nGuidelines for Palliative Care).  \nGynecologic Survivorship \nTreatment for gynecologic cancer typically involves surgery, \nchemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation therapy, and/or \nimmunotherapy , which may cause acute, short -term, and long- term \ntoxicities.  Surgical approaches may be extensive and cause adhesions to \nform, which in turn may cause pain and contribute to the development of \nsmall bowel obstruction, urinary or gastrointestinal complications (eg, \nincontinence, diarrhea), pelvic floor dysfunction (manifested by a variety of \nurinary, bowel, and/or sexual effect s), and lymphedema.145,146 \nChemotherapy agents vary, though commonly used regimens may pose a significant risk of neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity, cognitive dysfunction, and \nthe development of hematologic cancers.\n147 Long- term estrogen \ndeprivation may cause symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:51 PM.

Radiation therapy may cause long- term complications (eg, \nfibrosis,  stenosis,  vulvovaginal atrophy)148,149 and may predispose patients \nto subsequent  cancers of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and/or underlying \norgans that are proximal to the radiation field.150 Use of i mmunotherapy \nagents  in gynecologic cancers is emerging, and to date, long- term effects \nof these treatments are unknown.151,152  \nFollowing completion of treatment, all gynecologic cancer survivors should \nreceive regular general medical care that focuses on managing chronic \ndiseases (eg, depression, diabetes, hypertension), monitoring \ncardiovascular risk factors, receiving recommended vaccinations, and \nencouraging adoption of a healthy lifestyle (eg, promoting exercise, \nsmoking cessation).153,154 In order to assess the late and long- term effects \nof gynecologic cancers, clinicians should comprehensively document the patient’s history, including prior treatment history, and conduct a thorough \nphysical examination followed by necessary imaging and/or  laboratory \ntesting.\n154 As most treatments for gynecologic cancers will cause sexual \ndysfunction, early menopause, and infertility, special attention to the \nresultant medical and psychosocial implications is needed. All individuals , \nwhether sexually active or not, should be asked about genitourinary symptoms, including vulvovaginal dryness.\n155 Post-radiation use of vaginal \ndilators and moisturizers is recommended.148,156 Psychosocial effects may \ninclude psychological (eg, depression, anxiety, fear of recurrence, altered \nbody image), financial (eg, return to work, insurance concerns), and \ninterpersonal (eg, relationships, sexuality, intimacy).154 Patients should be \nreferred to appropriate specialty providers (eg, physical therapy, pelvic floor therapy, sexual therapy, psychotherapy) as needed, based on prior \ntreatment history and assessed risk of developing late effects and/or \nexisting concerns.  \nCommunication and coordination with all clinicians involved in the care of survivors, including primary care clinicians, is critical.\n154,157 During subsequent pregnancies, early ultrasound to confirm intrauterine \npregnancy is recommended. Pathologic evaluation of placenta needs to \nbe performed and hCG levels need to be checked at 6 weeks  postpartum \nto confirm that the levels have returned to negative. Providing survivors with a summary of their treatment and recommendations for follow -up is \nalso recommended. To this end, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology \n(SGO) has developed templates for gynecologic cancer -specific \nSurvivorship Care Plans to aid survivors and their clinicians in summarizing cancer history, treatments received, possible side effects, \nand recommended follow -up.\n158 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:39:51 PM.
