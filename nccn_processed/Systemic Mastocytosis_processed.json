See Classification of Mastocytosis  \n(SM-A); Diagnostic Criteria for Cutaneous Mastocytosis (SM-B) ; Diagnostic Criteria for Systemic \nMastocytosis (SM-C); and Diagnostic Criteria for the Variants of Systemic Mastocytosis (SM-D). \nb Patients should be counseled about the signs/symptoms and potential triggers of mast cell \nactivation (SM-J). Multidisciplinary collaboration with subspecialists (eg, anesthesia for procedures/\nsurgery; high-risk obstetrics for pregnancy) is recommended ( SM-L).\nc Serum tryptase level may be <20 ng/mL or only transiently elevated.\nd If no MIS and high-sensitivity KIT D816V mutation testing (digital droplet PCR or KIT D816V allele-\nspecific PCR) is negative in the peripheral blood, REMA score (SM-I) may be a useful decision tool \nto decide if bone marrow evaluation is necessary. Bone marrow biopsy should be considered if the \nREMA score is ≥2, (ECNM-AIM Recommendations: Valent P, et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract \n2022;10:1999-2012.e6.\ne Mast cell markers by flow cytometry immunophenotyping include CD117, CD25, CD30, and CD2. \nIHC markers include CD117, CD25, CD30, and tryptase. Also see SM-2.f Specific criteria have been established for primary and secondary MCAS (Akin C. J \nAllergy Clin Immunol 2017;140:349-355). See Discussion .\ng Management of CM is not included in these guidelines. Referral to centers with \nexpertise in CM  is strongly recommended. \nh HαT is a multisystem disorder characterized by duplications and triplications in \nthe TPSAB1 gene encoding a-tryptase associated with elevation of the basal \nserum tryptase level and symptoms including cutaneous flushing and pruritus, \ndysautonomia, functional gastrointestinal symptoms, chronic pain, and connective \ntissue abnormalities, including joint hypermobility (Lyons JJ, et al. Nat Genet \n2016;48:1564-1569). HαT may be diagnosed alone, but is also enriched in patients \nwith SM, especially indolent or smoldering SM (ISM/SSM). It may also be found \nin patients with CM. HαT is associated with an increased risk of severe mediator \nsymptoms/anaphylaxis. (Greiner G, et al. Blood 2021;137:238-247 and Lyons JJ, \net al.

The basal tryptase level may be divided by 1 plus the number of extra copies of the α-tryptase gene. For example, \nif the tryptase level is 30 ng/mL and two extra copies of the α-tryptase gene are found in a patient with HαT, the HαT-corrected tryptase level is 10 ng/mL (30/3 = 10), \nthereby not meeting the level of a minor systemic mastocytosis criterion.\ne The identification of one of the tyrosine kinase gene fusions associated with MLNE excludes a diagnosis of SM. Rare cases with both a gene fusion associated with \nMLNE and a KIT mutation have been reported, and the MLNE represents the AMN.Footnotes\nReferences\n1 Adapted with permission from Verstovsek S, Colmenero, I, Cozzolino I, et al.

Reactive \ncauses are excluded and criteria for myeloid neoplasms are not met.\n• Hepatomegaly on palpation or imaging (ultrasound, CT, or \nMRI) without ascites or other signs of organ damage and/or  \nsplenomegaly on palpation or imaging  without hypersplenism \nand/or lymphadenopathy on  palpation or imaging (˃20 mm)• Hepatomegaly without impaired liver function, palpable splenomegaly \nwithout hypersplenism and/or lymphadenopathy  \n>1 cm (palpation or imaging)\nFootnotes\na In patients with SM in whom less than 2 B-findings and no C-findings are detected, the diagnosis is ISM. The diagnosis of BMM requires no B- or C-findings. When \n2 or more B-findings but no C-findings are present, the diagnosis is SSM. When 1 or more C-findings (with or without additional B-findings) are detected, the final \ndiagnosis is ASM (<20% MCs in bone marrow smears). \nb In the case of a known HαT, the basal serum tryptase level can be adjusted. The optimal method of adjustment is not definitively defined. A common method is \nto divide the basal tryptase level by 1 plus the number of extra copies of the α-tryptase gene. For example, with a tryptase level of 300 and 2 extra copies of the \nα-tryptase gene in a patient with HαT, the HαT-corrected tryptase level is 100 (300/3 = 100) and therefore does not qualify as a B finding. \nc Signs of myeloproliferation and/or myelodysplasia must be discrete and stable and must not meet diagnostic criteria for an MPN, MDS, or MDS/MPN, excluding SM-\nAHN. The presence of a myeloid AHN excludes B findings and SSM by definition.\nReferences\n1 Adapted with permission from Verstovsek S, Colmenero, I, Cozzolino I, et al. Systemic mastocytosis.

The percentage of circulating mast cells should be reported in patients with MCL  (eg, ≥10% vs. <10% \nmast cells [aleukemic variant]).\n• Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should include comment on the percentage of neoplastic mast cells, and their morphology (spindle-\nshaped, well-differentiated [resembling normal mast cells],a and immature [eg, promastocytes with indented or bilobed nuclei or \nmetachromatic blasts]). The percentage of abnormal mast cells out of total mast cells should be determined. The aspirate should also be \nreviewed for features of an AHN.\n• Bone marrow core biopsy (1–2 cm) analysis should include comment on the percent mast cell burden and morphology of mast cells in \nbiopsy (eg, multifocal dense infiltrates [a major diagnostic criterion] or a primarily interstitial pattern of involvement). In patients with a \nprimarily interstitial pattern of mast cells, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and negativity for KIT D816V mutation, then the FIP1L1::PDGFRA \ngene fusion should be tested. \n• On the core biopsy, IHC with markers for mast cell tryptase, CD117, CD25, and CD30 should be performed to optimize quantification of the \nbone marrow biopsy mast cell burden. Cytoplasmic and/or surface expression of CD30 may be found on mast cells, especially in advanced \ndisease. CD34 staining may also be obtained to quantify whether the proportion of myeloblasts is increased, especially in SM-AHN, eg, \nSM associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN); MDS/MPN; chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not \notherwise specified; or AML. \n• Reticulin and collagen staining should also be undertaken to assess the grade of bone marrow fibrosis (eg, MF-0 to MF-3), which is relatively \ncommon in advanced SM ˃ISM/SSM, particularly in areas of mast cell aggregates.\n• Flow cytometry is a complementary tool in the diagnosis or monitoring of mast cell disease. CD117, CD25, CD30, and CD2 are standard \nflow markers. Flow cytometric characterization of mast cells comprises rare event analyses; optimal techniques for characterization and \nenumeration of neoplastic mast cells are described in the literature.1-3\n• Chromosome analysis should be obtained in the workup of SM, especially in patients with a suspected AHN.\n• Myeloid mutation panel testing should be performed on the bone marrow, but can be performed on the peripheral blood in the presence of \nan AHN and/or circulating mast cells. Myeloid mutation panels alone are not recommended for the detection of KIT D816V. NGS assays can \nexhibit low sensitivity and higher-sensitivity assays should always be performed.

Fresh bone marrow aspirate \nis preferable, but formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue can also be used. Decalcified tissue typically interferes with DNA/RNA  assays, and thus, \ndecalcified bone marrow should not be used for mutational analysis. If initial screening of the peripheral blood does not detect the KIT D816V mutation in a \npatient with suspected SM, testing of the bone marrow should be undertaken with a highly sensitive assay (eg, ASO-qPCR or digital droplet PCR).\n• When applied to the bone marrow, these assays can detect the  KIT D816V mutation in >95% of patients with SM, a sensitivity that is considered sufficient \nin daily practice for routine diagnostic screening of SM. In cases of a suboptimal bone marrow aspirate (eg, dry tap), testing of the peripheral blood should \nbe undertaken as an alternative option for detection of KIT D816V mutation. \n• In <5% to 10% of patients, no KIT D816V mutation is detected. This may be due to: 1) patients are in fact KIT D816V positive, but the (very) low mast cell \nburden leads to a false-negative result because the sensitivity of the applied assay is too low and/or the tissue sample is suboptimal; 2) patients indeed \nonly bear wild-type KIT; or 3) patients are positive for other mutations at codon 816 (D816H, D816Y, or others) or in other regions of KIT that are not \ndetectable by high-sensitivity assays (eg, ASO-qPCR or digital droplet PCR). In patients with low mast cell burden ISM who are otherwise negative for KIT \nD816V mutation, evaluation for KIT D816V mutation in the skin or from an extracutaneous organ besides the bone marrow could be considered. \n• In patients with a high mast cell burden and a negative KI T D816V screen, the result should be confirmed with the most sensitive technique available \n(eg, ASO-qPCR or digital droplet PCR), if not originally obtained with this technique. If KIT D816V mutation is still negative, this should be followed by \nevaluation of KIT for alternative codon 816 mutations, which requires amplification of codon 17 and sequencing of the resulting amplicons, or preferably \npeptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR.\n• If no mutation is found at codon 816, sequencing of the whole KIT coding sequence by NGS may be undertaken. However, the sensitivity of myeloid gene \nmutation panels for detection of KIT mutations is relatively lower, at ~5%.\n• In patients with low mast cell burden ISM and a stable, clinical course, evaluation of KIT D816V allele burden (if available) should be considered at \ndiagnosis, but should not necessarily be repeated, unless signs of disease progression occur. \n• In patients with more aggressive forms of SM, and those enrolled in clinical trials involving cytoreductive therapies, evaluation of KIT D816V allele burden \n(if available) by high-sensitivity assays (eg, ASO-qPCR or digital droplet PCR) on DNA or on RNA/ complementary DNA should be considered before \ninitiating therapy and serially during therapy.KIT D816V  MUTATION TESTING4\nReferences on SM-H (3 of 3) b In the absence of a highly sensitive quantitative PCR assay, qualitative PCR can be used.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

The primary goal of management is to prevent mast cell \nactivation during and in the immediate aftermath of the surgical procedure. \n• Careful review of prior anesthetic records and identification/avoidance of known triggers of mast cell activation are critical.\n• Temperature extremes (hypothermia or hyperthermia) and unnecessary trauma (eg, with patient positioning) that could lead to mast cell \nactivation symptoms, skin blistering, or osteolytic fractures should be avoided in the operating room.\n• Pre-anesthetic treatment is probably helpful in reducing the frequency and/or severity of mast cell activation events. This includes the use of \nanxiolytic agents (eg, benzodiazepines), antihistaminesa (H1 and H2 blockers), and possibly corticosteroids, which can help in resolution of \nmast cell activation symptoms.\n• Certain perioperative drugs are considered safer, although the supporting data are anecdotal and not evidence-based. These include certain \nanesthetic induction (propofol) or inhalational (sevoflurane or isoflurane) agents, analgesics (fentanyl or remifentanil), local anesthetics \n(lidocaine, bupivacaine), and skin antiseptics (povidone iodine).\n• Agents to be avoided include the muscle relaxants atracurium and mivacurium (rocuronium and vecuronium may be safer) and \nsuccinylcholine. While caution should be exercised with opiates (eg, codeine or morphine), it is important, however, that analgesics not be \nwithheld from patients with SM since pain can be a trigger for mast cell activation.\n• Management of mast cell activation symptoms depends upon their severity, and relies upon discontinuation of the suspected drug or \nanesthetic agent, fluid resuscitation, and intravenous epinephrine for severe reactions. Corticosteroids and antihistamines (H1 and H2 \nblockers) may be used as adjuncts.\n• In the event of anaphylaxis or other mast cell activation event, a full allergic workup should be initiated. Serum tryptase level should be \nchecked within 30–120 minutes of symptom onset.b Measurement of baseline serum tryptase level after full recovery is an important \ncomparator. Identification of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to drugs or latex requires detection of specific IgE and skin testing (skin prick \nand intradermal tests).\n• Carry two epinephrine auto-injectors. Use an H1 blocker 1 hour before receiving a vaccine. Following vaccination, patients should be \nobserved for 60 minutes.6 \nContinued\nReferences on SM-L (2 of 4)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

Please refer to the table for medications used to treat mastocytosis and their potential risks during \nboth pregnancy and lactation ( SM-L 3 of 4).\n• During pregnancy, for patients with severe SM refractory to conventional therapy, cytoreductive therapy with peginterferon alfa-2ac is an \noption. Use of cladribine or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, imatinib, midostaurin, avapritinib) is not recommended. There are no sufficient \ndata to establish the use of peginterferon alfa-2a in pregnancy. It should be used only if benefits outweigh potential risk to the fetus.SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE CARE OF PATIENTS WITH SYSTEMIC MASTOCYTOSISPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nSystemic Mastocytosis  \nMS-2 Overview \nMastocytosis is a group of heterogeneous disorders resulting from the \nclonal growth of abnormal mast cells and their accumulation in the skin \nand/or in extracutaneous organs.1 In the revised 2017 WHO classification, \nmastocytosis was removed as one of the subtypes of myeloproliferative \nneoplasms (MPN) and has since been listed as a separate disease entity \nwith its own distinctive clinical and pathologic features.2 Cutaneous \nmastocytosis (CM) is limited to the skin and is most commonly diagnosed \nin children. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is the most common form of \nmastocytosis diagnosed in adults, characterized by mast cell infiltration of \none or more extracutaneous organs (with or without skin involvement). \nMast cell sarcoma, defined as a malignant mast cell neoplasm presenting \nas a solitary destructive mass, is extremely rare in humans.3 \nThe comprehensive care of patients with mastocytosis requires a \nmultidisciplinary team approach (involving dermatologists, hematologists, pathologists, gastroenterologists, allergists, and immunologists) , \npreferably in specialized centers with expertise in the treatment of patients with mast cell disorders.\n4-6 The identification of KIT  D816V mutation and \nthe emergence of new targeted therapies have significantly improved the \ndiagnosis and treatment of SM.6-8 However, certain aspects of clinical \ncare, particularly the diagnosis, assessment , and management of mast \ncell activation symptoms , continue to present challenges. \nThe NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) \nfor Systemic Mastocytosis provide recommendations for the diagnosis and \ncomprehensive care of patients with SM. Management of CM is not \nincluded in these guidelines. Referral to centers with expertise in \nmastocytosis is strongly recommended.   Guidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the D evelopment and U pdate of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines® for Systemic \nMastocytosis , an electronic search of the PubMed database was \nperformed to obtain key literature in Systemic Mastocytosis published \nsince the previous Guidelines update using the following search term: systemic mastocytosis . The PubMed database was chosen as it remains \nthe most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature.\n9 \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial,  Phase II; Clinical Trial,  Phase III; Clinical Trial,  Phase IV; \nGuideline; Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; \nMeta -Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies . The data \nfrom key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines as discussed by the panel \nduring the Guidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion section.  Recommendations for which high -level evidence is \nlacking are based on the panel’s review of lower -level evidence and \nexpert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.10 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to \nuse language that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -\nclassist, anti -misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight biased; \nand inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nSystemic Mastocytosis  \nMS-3 focusing on organ -specific recommendations. This language is both \nmore accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN \nGuidelines will continue to use the terms men, wom en, female, and male \nwhen citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how \nsex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably \nor inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex \nassigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages \nresearchers to collect more specific data in future studies and \norganizations to  use more inclusive and accurate language in their future \nanalyses.  \nDiagnostic Classification  \nCutaneous Mastocytosis  \nThe diagnosis of CM requires the presence of clinical and histopathologic \nfindings of abnormal mast cell infiltration of the dermis with no evidence of \nsystemic mast cell infiltration either in the bone marrow or other \nextracutaneous organs.2 CM is further subdivided into three different \nsubvariants: urticaria pigmentosa (UP)/maculopapular cutaneous \nmastocytosis (MPCM), diffuse CM, and mastocytoma of the skin.11 \nSystemic Mastocytosis \nIn 2022, the International Consensus Classification (ICC)12 and a 5th \nedition of the WHO Classification13 generated modifications to the \ndiagnostic criteria for SM. Diagnostic criteria include one major diagnostic \ncriterion (multifocal, dense infiltrates of tryptase and/or CD117- positive \nmast cells [≥15 mast cells in aggregates] detected in the biopsy sections of bone marrow and/or extracutaneous organs) and four minor diagnostic \ncriteria (the presence of 25% of more mast cells with atypical morphology \nin lesional tissues; the presence of KIT D816V or other activating KIT mutation; the aberrant expression of CD2, CD25 , and/or CD30 on \nneoplastic mast cells ; and a serum tryptase level >20 ng/mL)  in the \nabsence of an associated myeloid neoplasm  (AMN) . In the ICC , in cases \nwhere an aspirate is a dry tap and unevaluable, mast cell leukemia (MCL) may be diagnosed on a core biopsy if a diffuse mast cell infiltrate is \npresent.  \nIn the WHO diagnostic criteria, t he diagnosis of SM is established when \none major criterion and at least one minor criterion are present, or when at least three minor criteria are present.\n14 This is similar for the ICC \ndiagnostic criteria; however, the presence of one major criterion is enough \nfor a diagnosis of SM . If the major criterion is not met, then at least three  \nminor criteria are required.12 In the 2022 WHO classification, SM is further \ndivided into six different subvariants (based on the mast cell burden, organ \ninvolvement, and SM -related organ damage).13 \n• Indolent SM (ISM)  \n• Bone marrow mastocytosis (BMM)  \n• Smoldering SM (SSM)  \n• Aggressive SM (ASM)  \n• SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM -AHN)  \n• Mast cell leukemia (MCL)   \n \nDividing SM into subclassifications has been validated in a number of \nstudies .15-17 In the ICC classification , BMM is considered a \nclinicopathologic variant of ISM.12 The associated hematologic neoplasm \n(AHN) terminology is changed to AMN , reflecting the fact that almost all of \nthese concurrent neoplasms exhibit a myeloid phenotype. The diagnostic \ncriteria for variants of SM  are outlined in Diagnostic Criteria for Variants of \nSystemic Mastocytosis.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nSystemic Mastocytosis  \nMS-4 Well- differentiated SM (WDSM ) is a rare variant characterized by bone \nmarrow infiltration of round, rather than spindle- shaped mast cells often \nlacking KIT D816V mutation or that have juxtamembrane or \ntransmembrane  KIT mutations (exons 10– 11) and low or absent CD25 \nexpression .18 WDSM is not a WHO -defined variant, but rather is a \nmorphologic variant that exists across the spectrum of WHO -defined \nsubtypes of both ISM and advanced SM  (ASM, SM -AHN,  and MCL) . \nWDSM has a female predominance and may have a cutaneous onset in \nchildhood. The presence of exon 10 or 11 mutations or  lack of the KIT \nD816V mutation may increase the potential for responsiveness to \ntreatment with imatinib.19-21 An increased expression of CD30 along with \nthe absence of CD25 may be useful in the diagnosis of WDSM and aid  in \nits distinction from other subtypes of SM.18,22  \nMast Cell Activation Syndrome  \nMast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) refers to a group of disorders \nassociated with episodic symptoms related to mast cell mediator release \nand can be  divided into primary, secondary, and idiopathic .23-26 Primary \nMCAS is also referred to  as monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome \n(MMAS).  \nMCAS is not considered a subtype of SM , but mast cell activation \n(mediator) symptoms may still occur. MCAS is not associated with \nan overproliferation of cells and is not considered a prediagnostic \ncondition that ultimately progresses to SM. Basic defining criteria of MCAS include: 1) episodic symptoms consistent with mast cell mediator release \naffecting greater than or equal to two  organ systems; 2) a decrease in the \nfrequency or severity, or resolution of symptoms with anti -mediator drug \ntherapy; and 3) elevation of a validated urinary or serum marker of mast \ncell activation, such as serum tryptase level (which is the marker of \nchoice).\n25  In patients with mast cell activation symptoms, but with normal mast cell \nmorphology/immunophenotype without the KIT D816V mutation, other \ncauses of mast cell activation should be considered (eg , secondary MCAS \ncaused  by allergies, drugs, connective tissue disorders, infections, chronic \ninflammatory or neoplastic disorders, urticaria). In patients with mast cell \nactivation symptoms for whom no cause is identified, a diagnosis of \nidiopathic MCAS is rendered on a provisional basis until a specific cause \nof mast cell activation is found.  \nHereditary alpha- tryptasemia  \nSome patients with mediator symptoms , including anaphylaxis, have been \ndiagnosed with hereditary alpha- tryptasemia  (HαT), a multisystem disorder \ncharacterized by duplications and triplications in the TPSAB1  gene \nencoding α-tryptase. This condition is associated with elevation of the \nbasal serum tryptase (a minimum value of 8 ng/m L, although normal, may \nbe found in these patients)  as well as symptoms including cutaneous \nflushing and pruritus, dysautonomia, functional gastrointestinal symptoms, chronic pain, and connective tissue abnormalities, including joint \nhypermobility.\n27 Some patients with H αT have an  asymptomatic  \npresentation. HαT may be diagnosed alone, but it is also enriched in \npatients with SM, especially ISM or SSM. It may also be found in patients \nwith CM. HαT is associated with an increased risk of severe mediator \nsymptoms and anaphylaxis.28,29 While it is currently unclear how this \nsymptom complex relates to increased copy number of the TPSAB1  gene, \ntesting for this inherited genetic variant may be considered.  Since patients \nwith SM can have symptoms of mast cell activation and also carry a \ndiagnosis of H αT, it is important to apply WHO criteria to formally establish \nthe diagnosis of SM.  \nClinical Presentation  \nMastocytosis is associated with a variety of symptoms related to the release of mast cell mediators  and mast cell tissue infiltration.\n30 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nSystemic Mastocytosis  \nMS-5 Anaphylaxis can be a life -threatening manifestation of mast cell activation, \nwhich requires immediate medical attention, the use of epinephrine, and \nother supportive care measures.  \nWhile some patients present with isolated symptoms, others develop a constellation of symptoms related to mast cell activation. The most \ncommon clinical symptoms include cutaneous symptoms (eg , flushing of \nthe face, neck, and chest ; pruritus ; itching; hives  with or without \nangioedema; skin rashes ), wheezing and shortness of breath , dizziness, \nsyncope, cardiovascular symptoms ( ie, rapid heart rate, chest pain, low \nblood pressure) , gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, diarrhea, nausea, \nvomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, gastroesophageal reflux disease), fatigue, musculoskeletal symptoms ( ie, bone/muscle pain), and \nneuropsychiatric symptoms (eg, headache and/or brain fog, cognitive \ndysfunction, anxiety and depression).\n31-34   \nSymptoms occur either spontaneously or in response to triggers of mast \ncell activation (eg, sunlight, heat, cold or sudden temperature changes, \nphysical and emotional stress, food, alcohol consumption, insect stings, venoms, infections, drugs [ ie, opioids, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory \ndrugs (NSAIDs ), antibiotics (eg, vancomycin , quinolones ), anesthetic \nagents], contrast dyes, surgery , other clinical procedures [eg, endoscopy,  \ncolonoscopy]).\n31,34  \nThe mastocytosis quality -of-life questionnaire (MQLQ) and the \nmastocytosis symptom assessment form (MSAF) can be used for the \nassessment of symptoms at baseline and monitoring symptom status \nduring the course of treatment in patients with ISM and SSM.34 In the \nWHO and ICC diagnostic criteria, clinical signs of disease related to SM \nare classified as B -findings or C -findings depending on the presence or \nabsence of organ involvement and/or organ damage.2 Evaluation of \nB-findings and C -findings is key to establishing the diagnosis of subtype of \nSM.  B-Findings  \nB-findings indicate a higher burden of SM and include: 1) high mast cell \nburden on bone marrow biopsy (>30% mast cells on bone marrow biopsy  \nand serum total tryptase level >200 ng/m L); 2) signs of dysplasia or \nmyeloproliferation in non -mast cell lineage(s), but criteria are not met for \nthe definitive diagnosis of an AHN, with normal or only slightly abnormal blood counts; and 3)  for hepatomegaly without impairment of liver function, \npalpable splenomegaly without hypersplenism, and/or lymphadenopathy on palpation or imaging.\n2,12 In the ICC classification, instead of signs of \ndysplasia or myeloproliferation in non -mast cell lineage, B- finding is \nmodified to “ Cytopenia (not meeting criteria for C- findings) or -cytosis. \nReactive causes are excluded, and criteria for other myeloid neoplasms are not met. ”\n12 In the  WHO 5th edition classification, a KIT D816V variant \nallele frequency  (VAF)  greater than or equal to 10 % is a qualifying B -\nfinding.13 \nC-Findings  \nC-findings  are defined by one or more signs of organ damage due to \ninfiltration by neoplastic mast cells, and are common in patients with \nadvanced SM.2 Examples of organ damage include one or more \ncytopenia(s) (eg, absolute neutrophil count  [ANC]  <1 x 109/L; hemoglobin \nlevel <10 g/dL; and/or platelet count < 100 x 109/L due to bone marrow \ndysfunction by neoplastic mast cell infiltration) ; palpable splenomegaly \nwith hypersplenism ; skeletal involvement, with large osteolyses (> 2 cm) \nwith or without pathologic fractures; palpable hepatomegaly with impairment of liver function, and/or ascites, and/or portal hypertension;  \nand malabsorption (eg, hypoalbuminemia) with weight loss due of \ngastrointestinal mast cell infiltrates.\n2,33 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nSystemic Mastocytosis  \nMS-6 Diagnostic Criteria for Variants of Systemic Mastocytosis  \nIndolent Systemic Mastocytosis  \nISM meets the general criteria for SM and is characterized by low mast \ncell burden, and no evidence of C -findings or an AHN.2 Skin lesions are \nalso frequently present. Patients exhibit a relatively younger age at \npresentation, lower incidence of constitutional symptoms (15%), and a \nhigher prevalence of skin lesions (85%) and cutaneous symptoms \n(78%).17 Patients with ISM exhibit a life expectancy similar to that of an \nage-matched general population, with a median survival of 301 months.  \nUsing data from the registry of the European Competence Network on \nMastocytosis (ECNM) , which comprised 1639 patients with SM, Sperr et \nal35 reported a median overall survival ( OS) of 28.4 years (95% CI, 24.1–\n32.8 years) and a survival rate of 93.5% (95% CI, 90.1%– 95.8%) at 10 \nyears  for patients with ISM . About 2.9% of patients will progress to \nadvanced SM.36  \nBone Marrow Mastocytosis  \nIn the 2022 WHO classification, BMM  is a separate category from  ISM but \nin the ICC classification, it is a subvariant of ISM.12,13 Diagnostic criteria \nare the same as ISM; however , mast cell infiltration is confined to the bone \nmarrow with no skin or multiorgan visceral lesions.2,17,37 The incidence of \nsymptoms associated with mast cell mediator release is higher in BMM (86% compared to 67% for ISM and 50% for SSM) , but the median \nsurvival is superior for patients with BMM (not reached compared to 301 months for ISM).\n17 \nSmoldering Systemic Mastocytosis \nSSM meets the general criteria for ISM.2 It is defined by two or more \nB-findings, and no evidence of C- findings or an AHN.  SSM is \ncharacterized by a relatively high mast cell burden, older age at \npresentation, and higher frequency of constitutional symptoms (45%).17 SSM is associated with inferior median survival (120 months compared to \n301 months for ISM) and a significantly higher risk of transformation to \nacute myeloid leukemia (AML) or ASM (18% compared to <1% for ISM). \nHowever, patients with SSM were significantly older ; in a multivariate \nanalysis, advanced age was the primary determinant of inferior OS and \nSSM was not independently associated with inferior OS. Owing to these \nclinical and prognostic differences (age distribution and risk of disease \ntransformation ), SSM was removed as a subcategory of ISM and listed as \nits own subvariant in the 2017 revised WHO classification.2 Registry data \nfrom the ECNM revealed that the median OS was not reached and the \nsurvival rate was 84.5% (95% CI, 61.1 %–84.5%) at 10 years for patients \nwith SSM.35   \nAggressive Systemic Mastocytosis \nThe diagnosis of ASM requires meeting the general criteria for SM and the \npresence of one or more C -findings, but does not meet the criteria for \nMCL.2 The diagnosis of ASM indicates that only morphologic evidence for \nmast cell disease is found; conversely, the concomitant presence of an \nAHN indicates a diagnosis of SM-AHN, even if C -findings are felt to be \nrelated to the mast cell component. Skin lesions are usually absent and are less common in ASM compared to ISM. The median survival of \npatients with ASM  was 41 months in one study.\n16 ASM with 5 % to 19% \nmast cells in a bone marrow aspirate is referred to as ASM in \ntransformation.   \nSystemic Mastocytosis with  an Associated Hematologic (Myeloid) \nNeoplasm   \nSM-AHN meets the general criteria for SM as well as the diagnostic \ncriteria for the AHN.2 In KIT inhibitor trials of patients with advanced SM, \nSM-AHN has comprised approximately 70% of enrolled patients.38-40 \nC-findings may or may not be present. AHNs are of myeloid lineage in the \noverwhelming majority of patients  (~90%)  and lymphoid neoplasms (eg, PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

AHNs  of myeloid lineage include AML, \nMPN, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), MDS/MPN (eg, chronic \nmyelomonocytic leukemia [CMML] or MDS/MPN- unclassifiable [MPN -U]), \nand chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL, \nNOS) .41,42 MDS/MPNs (eg, CMML) are the most common type of AHN \nfound in SM -AHN. \nSM-AHN is characterized by older age at presentation, higher incidences \nof constitutional symptoms and hematologic abnormalities , and an inferior \nOS compared with other subtypes of SM without AHN.43 The outcome of \npatients with SM -AHN varies with the type of AHN.  One study found that \nSM-MDS and SM -MPN were associated with significantly longer median \nsurvival (42 months and 32 months , respectively) compared to SM -CMML \n(17 months), SM -MDS/  MPN -U (16 months), and SM -AML (11 months).42 \nThe rate of leukemic transformation was  more frequent in SM -MDS (29%) \nthan in SM -MPN (11%) or SM -CMML (6%).41 \nMast Cell Leukemia  \nMCL is defined histopathologically by the presence of greater than or \nequal to 20% neoplastic mast cells on a bone marrow aspirate  smear .2 \nThe ICC does not distinguish between acute and chronic MCL (see below) \nand only uses the term MCL.12 In addition,  in cases where an aspirate is a \ndry tap and unevaluable, MCL may be diagnosed on a core biopsy if a dense, diffuse infiltrate of atypical, immature mast cells is present. \nThe aleukemic variant (<10% circulating mast cells in peripheral blood) is \nmuch more common than the leukemic variant (≥10% circulating mast \ncells in peripheral blood). Acute MCL, characterized by the presence of \nC-findings/organ damage, is present in the majority of patients.\n2 Chronic \nMCL is defined as MCL without C -findings/organ damage and may display a more indolent disease course over time, but its natural history requires more study.\n44-46  \nMCL can present as a de novo disorder , or it can transform from advanced \nforms of SM such as ASM , SM-AHN or , very rarely, ISM.16,47,48 MCL is \nassociated with a poor prognosis regardless of the subtype or the presence of signs/symptoms of organ damage.  In a study that evaluated \nthe clinical and molecular characteristics of 28 patients with MCL, de novo MCL and secondary MCL resulting from leukemic transformation of \nSM-AHN or ASM were diagnosed in 57% and 43% of patients , \nrespectively, with no differences in clinical, morphologic , or molecular \ncharacteristics between the two variants.\n48 AHNs (CMML, CEL, MDS , and \nMDS/ MPN -U) were diagnosed in 71%  of patients with MCL (20 out of 28) \nand is generally associated with a worse prognosis, even within the \nspectrum of MCL . KIT D816V mutation was identified in 68% of patients \nand additional prognostically relevant mutations in SRSF2 /ASXL1 / RUNX1  \n(S/A/R ) genes , considered high- risk mutations,  were identified in 52% of \npatients.  In another study, the ECNM registry evaluated patients with \nMCL.49 An AHN was found in 34% of patients  and 14% of patients had \nchronic MCL. KIT D816V mutations, S/A/R  mutations, and an abnormal \nkaryotype were identified in 73% , 44%, and 17%  of patients, respectively. \nA median OS of 1.6 years was reported.  A diagnosis of MCL- AHN, an \nabnormal karyotype, and the absence of KIT  D816V were associated with \nreduced OS.  \nWorkup   \nEvaluation for SM is recommended in patients with suspected clinical \nsymptoms associated with the release of mast cell mediators or \nanaphylaxis, and/or increased serum tryptase level or biopsy -proven adult -\nonset mastocytosis in the skin (MIS).

Laboratory evaluation should include comprehensive metabolic panel with uric acid, lactate \ndehydrogenase, liver function tests, complete blood count ( CBC)  with \ndifferential, and serum tryptase level. Peripheral blood smear should be reviewed for the presence of mast cells and/or for the evidence of other \nblood cell abnormalities (eg,  eosinophilia, dysplasia, monocytosis).   \nAdditional evaluations should include a bone marrow biopsy or biopsy of organ(s) with suspected extracutaneous involvement  if biopsy of that \norgan is felt to be important for clinical management or to ascertain whether mast cell involvement is the basis for organ damage ; \nhigh- sensitivity mutation analysis for the detection of KIT D816V mutation \nand multigene next -generation sequencing (NGS)  panel that includes \ngenes such as SRSF2 , ASXL1 , and RUNX1 ; mast cell \nimmunophenotyping by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or flow \ncytometry; imaging studies to document organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, \nand/or ascites (eg , B- and/or C -findings); and human leukocyte antigen \n(HLA) testing, if considering allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation \n(HCT) as a future option. Twenty -four-hour urine studies to document \nbiochemical evidence of mast cell activation can be useful under selected circumstances. More details on the measurement of urinary metabolites \nare provided in 24-Hour Urine Studies .  \nSerum Tryptase Level  \nSerum tryptase is elevated in the vast majority of patients with SM across \nall subtypes .\n50 However, a minority of patients with SM have a tryptase \nlevel below the minor diagnostic criterion level of 20 mg/m L, or more rarely \nin normal range, due to a very low neoplastic mast cell burden.51 Elevated \nlevels of serum tryptase have also been documented in patients with other myeloid malignancies , MCAS, HαT, and renal failure.27,52,53 Therefore, it is \nimportant to interpret elevated serum tryptase levels in the appropriate context since serum tryptase may also be transiently elevated during \nanaphylaxis or a severe allergic reaction.\n54  \nSerum total tryptase (>20 ng/m L) is one of the minor criteri a unless an \nAMN is present .12,14 While measurement of serum tryptase level is useful \nto estimate mast cell burden in patients with mastocytosis, such correlations may be confounded by the presence of an AHN , and the co-\noccurrence of H αT, which may also contribute to elevation of the serum \ntryptase level.\n27,52,53 Bone marrow evaluation should be done to confirm \nthe diagnosis of SM in patients who are symptomatic  with persistently \nelevated levels of serum tryptase.53 \nBone Marrow Evaluation  \nThe detection of multifocal, dense infiltrates of mast cells (≥15 mast cells \nin aggregates) in the biopsy sections of the bone marrow and/or other \nextracutaneous organs is a major criterion for the diagnosis of SM.2 The \npresence of spindle- shaped or atypical mast cells in the trephine biopsy \nsections of bone marrow or bone marrow aspirate smears or other \nextracutaneous organs is one of the minor criteria.  \nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy with mast cell immunophenotyping is almost always necessary to establish the diagnosis of SM.\n55 Bone marrow \nevaluation also helps in the detection of AHN, if present . Although bilateral \nbone marrow biopsies might be useful for the early diagnosis of SM or for \nthe detection of minimal bone marrow involvement, a unilateral bone \nmarrow biopsy is generally recommended.56  \nMast Cell Immunophenotyping  \nImmunohistochemical evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of \nSM in patients with low mast cell burden or if bone marrow involvement is PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

CD117, CD25, \nCD30, and CD2 are the standard markers.71,72 \nMolecular Testing  \nKIT D816V mutation occurs in the majority of patients (>90%) with \nSM.7,41,73,74 In SM -AHN, the KIT D816V mutation can also be found in cells \ncomprising the AHN. However, the frequency of KIT D816V mutation in \nthese cells is variable depending on the subtype of AHN, being most \ncommon in patients with SM -CMML (89%), and less frequent in patients \nwith SM -MPN (20%) and SM -AML (30%).75  \nIn addition to KIT D816V mutation, prognostically relevant mutations in \nseveral other genes ( TET2, SRSF2, CBL, ASXL1, RUNX1, EZH2, JAK2, \nand/or  RAS) have also been identified in advanced SM.76-84 The presence \nof one or more mutations  beyond KIT D816V , particularly in the \nSRSF2,  ASXL1,  RUNX1  (S/A/R ), and/or  EZH2  genes , has been \nassociated with significantly inferior OS and progression- free survival \n(PFS) .78,80,81,83,84 In addition, the presence of mutations in the ASXL1, \nRUNX1,  and/or DNMT3A genes  with VAFs greater than or equal to 30% \nhas also been identified as an independent predictor for PFS in ISM.85   \nMore refined prognostic scoring systems integrating clinical variables and \nhigh-molecular -risk (HMR)  mutations have been developed for the risk \nstratification of patients with SM  (See Risk Stratification ).35,86,87 Myeloid \nmutation panel testing should be performed on the bone marrow, but can \nbe performed on the peripheral blood in the presence of an AHN and/or \ncirculating mast cells.  \nEosinophilia is more prevalent in patients with advanced SM and is a \npredictor  of inferior survival outcomes .88,89 The FIP1L1::PDGFRA  fusion \noncogene resulting from the deletion of the CHIC2 locus at chromosome \n4q12 usually presents as a chronic myeloid neoplasm with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nSystemic Mastocytosis  \nMS-10 eosinophilia.90,91 Atypical or spindle- shaped mast cells that also express \nCD25 may be found in the bone marrow of such patients, usually in a \nloosely scattered or interstitial pattern without forming multifocal \naggregates.92 While patients with the FIP1L1 ::PDGFRA  fusion oncogene \nare not considered a subtype of SM, and KIT  D816V is rarely found in \nthese individuals, identifying FIP1L1:: PDGFRA  fusion in patients with \neosinophilia is critical since it is a predictor of excellent response to \nimatinib.93,94 The FIP1L1:: PDGFRA  fusion oncogene should be tested in \nperipheral blood in patients with eosinophilia who do not have the KIT  \nD816V mutation.   \nKIT D816V Mutational Analysis  \nDetection of the KIT D816V mutation (or another activating mutation in the \nKIT gene)  in the bone marrow, blood,  or another extracutaneous organ is \nincluded as a minor criterion.12,13 Myeloid mutation panels alone are not \nrecommended for the detection of KIT  D816V since NGS assays can \nexhibit low sensitivity  and higher -sensitivity assays should always be \nperformed . \nMutation analysis for KIT D816V is preferably done using a  bone marrow \nsample since the yield from the peripheral blood may be lower. Several \ndifferent sensitive assays have been used for the detection of KIT  D816V \nmutation, including reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) plus restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), nested \nRT-PCR followed by denaturing high- performance liquid chromatography \n(DHPLC), peptide nucleic acid (PNA) -mediat ed PCR , allele -specific \noligonucleotide quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (ASO -qPCR) ,\n95 and digital droplet PCR.96 In the absence of a \nhighly sensitive quantitative PCR  assay , qualitative PCR can be used.  \nASO -qPCR is a highly sensitive method for the detection of KIT  D816V \nmutation in various tissues.97 Several  studies have reported the possibility \nof detecting the KIT  D816V in peripheral blood using a highly sensitive ASO -qPCR or digital  droplet PCR.96,98 -100 However, ASO -qPCR may not \nbe useful for patients with low mast cell burden since KIT D816V mutation \nmay not be detectable in the peripheral blood. In addition, ASO -qPCR also \ndoes not detect KIT  mutations other than D816V (very rare occurring in \n<3% of patients). Therefore, if a diagnosis of SM is suspected, molecular \ntesting for KIT D816V with a highly sensitive ASO -qPCR or digital droplet \nPCR assay can first be performed on peripheral blood in combination with \nmeasurement of the serum tryptase level and evaluation of clinical signs \nand/or symptoms suggestive of SM -related organ involvement. If positive, \nthis should be followed by a detailed KIT  mutation analysis on the bone \nmarrow aspirate. KIT  D816V mutational analysis on the bone marrow \naspirate is particularly useful to establish the diagnosis of SM in patients \nwith low mast cell burden, those with limited systemic disease who may \nhave serum tryptase levels less than 20 ng/m L, and those who lack \nmultifocal mast cell clusters in a bone marrow biopsy.57,58  \nIn patients with low mast cell burden who are otherwise negative for KIT \nD816V mutation, evaluation for KIT  D816V mutation in the skin or an \nextracutaneous organ besides the bone marrow could be considered.95 In \npatients with a high mast cell burden who are otherwise negative for KIT \nD816V mutation, molecular testing should be confirmed with ASO -qPCR \nor digital  droplet PCR, if not originally obtained with this technique. If KIT \nD816V mutation is still negative, molecular testing for KIT  mutations other \nthan D816V should be done, preferably using PNA -mediated PCR.101 \nSequencing of the whole KIT  by NGS may be undertaken.  \nEvaluation of B -Findings and C -Findings and Organ Involvement  \nB-findings and C -findings are used for the diagnosis of the WHO subtype \nof SM.

This should permit harmonization of the types and \nseverity of organ damage t hat are evaluable across studies of patients \nwith advanced SM  who are being treated with novel therapies.2,102 \nImaging studies (CT/MRI or ultrasound of the abdomen/pelvis) are useful \nto document organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and ascites in patients \nwith advanced SM. Chest x -ray and/or CT of the thorax may be needed in \nselected circumstances to further assess whether pleural effusions are present in patients with advanced SM presenting with relevant pulmonary \nsymptoms. C -findings (organ damage caused by mast cell infiltration) \nshould be confirmed with appropriate organ- directed biopsy as needed \nwith IHC (CD117, CD25 , tryptase , and CD3 as a control T -cell marker ).  \nOsteoporosis and osteopenia are the most common bone complications in patients with SM ; the risk of osteoporosis and vertebral fractures is high in \npatients with ISM , and higher urinary N -methylhistamine levels are also \nassociated with a higher risk of osteoporosis .\n33,105- 109 In advanced SM, the \nfinding of an  increased bone mineral density (BMD) compared to those \nwithout elevated BMD was  associated with a more aggressive phenotype \nand inferior survival.109 \nSkeletal involvement, with large (≥2 cm) osteolytic lesions with or without \npathologic fractures is considered a C -finding. However, the presence of \none or more small osteolytic and/or sclerotic lesion(s) in the absence of other C -findings is insufficient to make a diagnosis of advanced SM and \nshould not alone be considered an indication for cytoreductive therapy. Dual-energy x -ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to evaluate for osteopenia \nor osteoporosis and consideration of a metastatic skeletal survey to \nevaluate for osteolytic lesions (in patients with clinical suspicion of focal \ndisease) are recommended as part of the initial workup for ISM and SSM . \nWhole body MRI to evaluate for the presence of osteolytic lesions is still a \nresearch -based imaging modality.\n110 \n24-Hour Urine Studies  \nThe measurement of urinary metabolites  of histamine and prostaglandin in \na 24- hour urine sample or spot urine has been shown to correlate with \nmast cell burden and activation.111 N-methylhistamine, prostaglandin D2,  \nand 2,3 -dinor -11 beta -prostaglandin F2 alfa are the most commonly \nmeasured metabolites.112- 117 Any elevation above normal is considered \nsignificant; however , cut-off levels for significant elevation of these \nmetabolites have  not been established.  \nWhile such urine studies do not have much utility  in patients with markedly \nelevated serum tryptase, the measurement of urinary metabolites may be \nuseful in the diagnosis and initiation of appropriate targeted therapy for \nsome of the mast cell activation symptoms (eg,  higher urinary \nN-methylhistamine levels are associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis; \ncertain symptoms associated with elevated urinary prostaglandin levels \ncan be targeted with aspirin).107,118  \nRisk Stratification \nThe Mayo Alliance Prognostic System (MAPS) and M utation- Adjusted \nRisk Score (MARS) use a combination of clinical variables and HMR  \nmutations for risk stratification.86,87 However, since HMR mutations were \nnot seen in patients with ISM and SSM, both MAPS and MARS are  \nprimarily applicable only for patients with advanced SM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nSystemic Mastocytosis  \nMS-12 Prognostic Scoring System for Mastocytosis (IPSM) score is based only \non the clinical variables and is useful for the risk stratification of patients \nwith ISM/SSM and advanced SM.35 The Global Prognostic Score for \nMastocytosis (GPSM)  is based on clinical variables that are prognostic \nfactors for OS and PFS.119   \nMAPS  \nIn a study of 580 patients with SM (ISM/SSM, n  = 291; SM -AHN, n = 199; \nASM, n = 85; and MCL, n = 5), clinical variables including age > 60 years, \nadvanced S M (vs . ISM/SSM) , thrombocytopenia ( platelets <150 x 109/L), \nanemia (hemoglobin level below sex -adjusted normal ), and increased \nalkaline phosphatase (ALP) were identified as independent risk factors for \nsurvival.86 In addition, the presence of ASXL1, RUNX1 , and NRAS \nmutations were independently associated with inferior survival. In the combined clinical  and molecular risk factor analysis, the presence of HMR  \nmutations , advanced SM, thrombocytopenia, increased ALP , and age > 60 \nyears retained prognostic significance. P atients with SM are stratified into \nfour different risk groups (low, intermediate- 1, intermediate -2, and high) \nwith significantly different median survival ( not reached, 85 months, 36 \nmonths , and 12 months , respectively).  This risk stratification is applicable \nonly for patients with advanced SM.   \nMARS  \nIn a study that included 231  patients with advanced SM  in the training \ncohort  (ASM, n = 30; SM -AHN,  n = 181; and MCL, n = 20), age >60 years, \nhemoglobin less than 10 g/dL, platelets less than 100 x 109, the presence \nof one HMR mutation ( SRSF2, ASXL1 , and/or RUNX1 [S/A/R ]), and the \npresence of two or more  S/A/R  mutations were independent predictors of \ninferior OS.87 The presence and number of S/A/R  mutations had a \nsignificant prognostic impact on O S. The weighted score was developed \nby assigning 2  points for the presence of two or more  S/A/R  mutations and \n1 point for each of the other adverse factors. Patients with advanced SM were stratified into three  risk groups (low, intermediate,  and high). The \nmedian OS was not reached for the low -risk group compared to 4 years \nand 2 years , respectively , for the intermediate and high- risk groups.  \nIPSM  \nIn a large cohort of patients with  mastocytosis (n = 1639 ; ISM, n = 1006; \nSSM, n = 53; SM-AHN, n = 174; ASM, n  = 62; and MCL, n  = 23), age ≥ 60 \nyears , and ALP greater than 100 u/ L were identified as predictors of \nhigher -grade mastocytosis and OS in patients with non- advanced \nmastocytosis  (CM, MIS, ISM , and SSM) .35 Age ≥60 years, tryptase greater \nthan or equal to 125 ng/m L, leukocytes greater than or equal to 16 x 10⁹/L, \nhemoglobin less than or equal to 11 g/dL, platelets less than or equal to \n100 x 109/L, and skin involvement were independent prognostic factors for \nOS in patients with advanced SM. IPSM was validated in a cohort of 462 \npatients (ISM, n = 384; SSM, n = 11; advanced SM, n = 49) .  \nPatients with non -advanced SM were stratified into three  risk groups (low, \nintermediate- risk 1 [INT -1], and intermediate- risk 2 [INT -2]) with \nsignificantly different OS (10- year OS rates were 87%, 52% , and 22% , \nrespectively) and PFS  (10-year PFS rates were 96%, 87% , and 76% , \nrespectively).  The difference in OS and PFS was significant  among the \nthree  risk groups for patients with ISM , whereas the OS rates were not \nsignificant  between the risk groups for patients with SSM.   \nPatients with advanced SM were stratified into four  risk groups (advanced \nSM 1 [AdvSM -1], advanced SM 2 [AdvSM -2], advanced SM 3 [AdvSM -3], \nand advanced SM 4 [AdvSM -4]). The OS for patients in risk groups \nAdvSM -1 and AdvSM -2 was similar to that of patients with non- advanced \nmastocytosis in the INT- 1 and INT- 2 risk groups, respectively.  \nGPSM  \nPrognostic parameters were examined in a discovery cohort of 422 patients with SM  (ISM, n = 368; SSM, n = 4; ASM, n = 18; SM -AHN, n = PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

Using the GPSM -PFS (n = 399) and \nGPSM -OS (n = 411)  models, patients were stratified into three  risk groups \n(low- risk, intermediate -risk, and high- risk). The PFS at 5 years was 100%, \n94%, and 47%, respectively, while the OS at 5 years was 100%, 94%, and \n62%, respectively. These results were corroborated in a validation cohort  \nof 853 patients (ISM, n = 607; SSM, n = 19; ASM, n = 44; SM -AHN, n = \n171; and MCL, n = 12) . After patient stratification in the low -, \nintermediate- , and high- risk groups using GPSM -PFS (n = 670) and \nGPSM -OS (n = 768) models, the 5- year PFS was 98%, 84%, and 43%, \nand the 5- year OS was 99%, 61%, and 30% , respectively.  \nA comparison of different scoring models showed that the GPSM -PFS \nmodel had a high prognostic  capability, especially in patients with non-\nadvanced SM.119 For patients with advanced SM, the GPSM -OS model \nand the IPSM model for advanced SM were the best predictive models.  \nTreatment Recommendations  \nReferral to specialized centers with expertise in the management of \nmastocytosis is strongly recommended.4-6 Multidisciplinary collaboration \nwith subspecialists (eg,  allergists for the management of anaphylaxis and \ndrug hypersensitivities, anesthesiologists  for invasive procedures  or \nsurgery; high -risk obstetrician for pregnancy) is recommended.  \nAssessment of symptoms at baseline and monitoring symptom status \nduring the course of  treatment with MQLQ and MSAF is recommended for \npatients with ISM and SSM.34  Anti-mediator drug therapy for mast cell activation symptoms (as \ndescribed below) is recommended for all patients with SM.  Patients should \nbe counseled about the signs and symptoms of mast cell activation120 and \nthe importance of avoiding known triggers of mast cell activation. The \nsigns and symptoms of mast cell activation as well the potential triggers of \nmast cell activation are summarized in SM -I.120 The advanced SM \nsymptom assessment form (AdvSM -SAF) is a 10 -item patient -reported \noutcome instrument that assesses the severity of the following symptoms: \nabdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, spots, itching, flushing, and \nfatigue.120 The frequency of vomiting and diarrhea are also taken into \naccount. Anaphylactic reactions are significantly more frequent in patients \nwith ISM and should be managed with the use of epinephrine injection. All \npatients should carry two auto injectors of epinephrine to manage \nanaphylaxis. Pre -medications are recommended for most procedures in \npatients with SM, since surgery, endoscopy , and other invasive and \nradiologic procedures can induce mast cell activation and anaphylaxis.  \nPotential c ytoreductive options for advanced SM include avapritinib, \nmidostaurin, cladribine , or peginterferon alfa- 2a. Peginterferon alfa -2a is \nan option for ASM and SM -AHN (when the SM component requires \nprioritization over the AHN component ) but is not recommended for MCL \nwith or without an AHN . However, cladribine or p eginterferon alfa -2a may \nalso be useful in select patients with symptomatic ISM or SSM with \nsevere, refractory symptoms related to mast cell mediator release or bone \ndisease not responsive to anti -mediator drug therapy or bisphosphonates.  \nGiven the potential toxicities associated with cladribine therapy, including drug- related myelosuppression and infections, the risks and potential \nbenefits of such treatment need to be weighed in this non -advanced SM \npopulation.   \nIn patients with SM -AHN, an initial assessment is undertaken to determine \nwhether the SM component or the AHN component requires prioritization .

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nSystemic Mastocytosis  \nMS-14 This determination can be challenging and reflects a comprehensive \nevaluation of several factors, including the relative burden and/or stage of \nthe SM and AHN disease components in the bone marrow and/or other \nextracutaneous organs. In some cases, organ- directed biopsy may be \nuseful to determine whether organ damage is related to the SM or AHN or both (eg,  liver biopsy in a patient with liver function abnormalities). \nAlthough chronic MCL may follow a more indolent disease course compared to acute MCL with organ damage,\n44-46 cytoreductive therapy \nshould still be considered for such patients given the poor prognosis of both MCL subtypes.  \nEnrollment in well- designed clinical trials investigating state -of-the-art \ntherapeutic strategies (eg,  highly selective KIT D816 inhibitors) is \nencouraged to enable further advances.  \nAnti-Mediator Drug Therapy  \nManagement of Chronic Symptoms Related to  Mast Cell Mediator Release  \nA stepwise treatment approach for specific symptoms should be \nconsidered for all patients who present with symptoms related to mast cell \nmediator release, as outlined in the algorithm on SM-K.121 The treatment \nplan may vary according to specific patient scenarios. Standard doses need to be titrated. Higher doses may be necessary for symptoms \nrefractory to standard dose treatment.  \nHistamine receptor type 1 (H1) and histamine receptor type 2 (H2) \nblockers have been shown to control skin symptoms (eg,  pruritus, flushing, \nurticaria, angioedema dermatographism) ; gastrointestinal symptoms (eg , \ndiarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea,  vomiting) ; neurological symptoms \n(eg, headache, poor concentration and memory, brain fog) ; cardiovascular \nsymptoms (eg, pre-syncope, syncope, tachycardia);  pulmonary symptoms \n(eg, wheezing, throat swelling) ; and naso -ocular symptoms ( eg, nasal \nstuffiness or prur itus, conjunctival injection).\n122  Cromolyn sodium is effective for the management of cutaneous, \ngastrointestinal , and neurological symptoms.123- 126 In one double- blind \ncrossover study, cromolyn sodium resulted in marked amelioration of skin pruritus, whealing, flushing, diarrhea, abdominal pain, as well as disorders \nof cognitive function compared to placebo.\n123 In another double- blind \ncrossover study, while cromolyn sodium was significantly beneficial for the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, \nand vomiting) compared to placebo, the benefit for nongastrointestinal \nsymptoms was not statisticall y significant.\n124 Topical cromolyn sodium \n(emulsion, ointment , or cream ; 1%–4%) is effective for the symptomatic \nrelief of pruritus, itch,  and flare caused by intradermal histamine and can \nbe used to decrease flare- ups of cutaneous symptoms in response to \ntriggers.125,126 \nAspirin, corticosteroids , and leukotriene receptor antagonists are useful for \nthe management of symptoms that are refractory to other treatment \noptions.122 In particular, leukotriene receptor antagonists have been used \nfor the management of skin and gastrointestinal symptoms that have not \nresponded to other therapies.127,128 Aspirin has been shown to be effective \nfor the management of symptoms associated with elevated urinary prostaglandin levels.\n129 However, the risks and benefits of aspirin need to \nbe weighed carefully since it can trigger mast cell activation in some patients.  \nOmalizumab,  an anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody,  has \nbeen shown to be effective for symptoms related to mast cell mediator \nrelease in patients with mastocytosis .\n130- 137 In a systematic review that \nassessed the efficacy and safety of omalizumab for the treatment of \nsymptoms related to mast cell mediator release in adult patients with \nmast ocytosis,  omalizumab  was particularly effective for recurrent \nanaphylaxis, skin,  and gastrointestinal symptoms as opposed to for \nneuropsychiatric, respiratory , and musculoskeletal symptoms.138 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nSystemic Mastocytosis  \nMS-15 Omalizumab can be used for the management of symptoms related to \nmast cell mediator release, insufficiently controlled by conventional \ntherapy.  \nManagement of Anaphylaxis  \nThe prevalence of anaphylaxis has been reported in 24% to 49% of \npatients with SM.31,139,140 Increased serum tryptase levels have  been \nidentified as a risk factor for anaphylaxis in some studies ,31,141 whereas \nother studies have identified absence of mastocytosis in skin, atopic SM, \nlow baseline tryptase levels , and higher total IgE levels as risk factors for \nsevere anaphylaxis.141- 143  \nHymenoptera venom allergy is an IgE -mediated hypersensitivity to the \nallergens in insect venom and accounts for 2% to 34% of all cases of \nanaphylaxis.144,145 Hymenoptera venom allergy  is an established risk factor \nfor severe recurrent anaphylaxis in patients with SM.146 Hymenoptera \nvenom anaphylaxis is more prevalent in patients with ISM and it seems to \nbe absent in patients with advanced SM with high mast cell burden.147 \nHymenoptera anaphylaxis may be the presenting symptom of \nmastocytosis in an otherwise healthy individual . Therefore, mastocytosis \nshould be suspected in patients who present with anaphylactic reactions \nafter Hymenoptera sting.  \nElevated baseline serum tryptase levels and mastocytosis are considered risk factors for severe Hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis.\n148- 151 In addition, \nvespid venom allergy, older age, male sex, angiotensin- converting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy, and previous insect stings with a less \nsevere systemic reaction have also been identified as predictors of \nsystemic anaphylactic reactions in pa tients with Hymenoptera venom \nallergy.150 KIT D816V mutation has been implicated in the hyperactivity of \nmast cells by amplifying the IgE -dependent mast cell mediator release.152 \nHowever, the exact mechanism of increased susceptibility to Hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis has not been elucidated in patients with SM.  Anaphylactic  symptoms should be treated with epinephrine as first -line \ntherapy. Antihistamines (H1 and H2 blockers) and steroids can be added as required. Systemic hives with no organ involvement can be managed \nwith the use of antihistamines. First -generation anticholinergic \nantihistamines are not recommended in adult patients >65 years of age.\n153 \nEpinephrine injection is the preferred treatment for systemic hives with \norgan involvement ( ie, upper/lower airway, gastrointestinal, neurological, \ncardiovascular) or an acute onset of anaphylaxis with the following symptoms: hypotension, laryngeal edema, vasomotor collapse, oxygen \ndesaturation, and/or seizures.\n145  \nVenom immunotherapy (VIT) is effective for the treatment of IgE -mediated \nHymenoptera venom anaphylaxis in patients with SM and has also been  \nshown to significantly reduce the risk of anaphylaxis after a re- sting.154- 157 \nVIT is recommended for all patients with a positive skin test or a positive \ntest for Hymenoptera- specific IgE antibodies as well as for those with a \nhistory of Hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis after an insect sting.145  \nOmalizumab is an effective treatment option for unprovoked anaphylaxis, \nHymenoptera venom - or food- induced anaphylaxis in patients with a \nnegative skin test , or those with a negative test for specific IgE \nantibodies .130- 132 Omalizumab can  also improve tolerance while on VIT.  \nManagement of Osteoporosis  \nSupplemental calcium and vitamin D are recommended.158,159 The use of \nbisphosphonates (with continued use of antihistamines) is recommended \nto resolve bone pain and improve vertebral BMD.160 Pamidronate and \nzoledronic acid have demonstrated efficacy, resulting in significant \nincreases in spine and hip BMD and decreases of bone turnover markers \nin a small series of patients with SM.161,162 Peginterferon alfa -2a may be \nconsidered for patients with refractory bone pain and/or worsening BMD  \non bisphosphonate therapy.163- 165  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nSystemic Mastocytosis  \nMS-16 Denosumab, an anti -RANKL  monoclonal antibody, has also been \nassociated with significant increases in BMD at lumbar and femoral sites, \nand decreases in bone turnover markers in serum (mainly C -terminal \ntelopeptide of collagen type I and bone ALP to a lesser extent).166 \nDenosumab can be used as a second -line therapy for patients with bone \npain not responding to bisphosphonates or for patients who are not \ncandidates for bisphosphonates because of renal insufficiency. A U.S. \nFood and Drug Administration ( FDA)-approved biosimilar is an appropriate \nsubstitute. Vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty could also be performed in \nselected patients for refractory pain associated with vertebral compression \nfractures.167  \nCytoreductive Therapy  \nIn the NCCN Guidelines, regimens for cytoreductive therapy are stratified \ninto three  categories (based on the evidence, efficacy, toxicity, and in \nsome cases access to certain agents): preferred regimens, other recommended regimens, and useful in certain circumstances.  \nThe management of mast cell activation symptoms with anti -mediator \ndrug therapy is recommended for symptomatic ISM or SSM. Enrollment \nin a clinical trial is a preferred option for these patients. Avapritinib (if \nplatelet counts are ≥ 50 x 10\n9/L)168 is also a preferred option for patients \nwith symptomatic ISM. Additionally, for symptomatic ISM or SSM, \ncladribine169- 171 or peginterferon alfa -2a172- 175 may be useful in certain \ncircumstances for select patients with severe, refractory mediator \nsymptoms or bone disease not responsive to anti -mediator therapy or \nbisphosphonates.121 \nEnrollment in a clinical trial, a vapritinib  (if platelet counts are ≥50 x \n109/L),39,40 and m idostaurin38,176,177 are preferred regimens and \ncladribine169- 171 and peginterferon alfa -2a (± prednisone)172- 175 are other \nrecommended regimen s for patients with ASM, SM -AHN  (when the SM component requires prioritization over the AHN component ), and MCL \n(with or without an AHN ) (except for peginterferon alfa- 2a ± prednisone) . \nImatinib is included as a useful in certain circumstances treatment option \nfor the rare patients with ASM ( for KIT D816V mutation negative after \ntesting with a high -sensitivity assay or unknown , WDSM, or if \neosinophilia is present with FIP1L1:: PDGFRA gene fusion , which \noperationally redefines the patients as having a myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions as defined \nby the WHO and ICC ).\n21,178- 184  \nAvapritinib  \nAvapritinib, a potent and selective inhibitor of KIT  D816V, has \ndemonstrated activity in patients with  ISM and advanced SM40,168 and is \nFDA-approved for the treatment of adult patients with ISM and advanced \nSM, including ASM, SM -AHN, and MCL.  \nIndolent SM  \nIn the phase II PIONEER trial, patients with moderate to severe ISM despite prior use of 2 or more best supportive care medications were \nrandomized 2:1 to receive avapritinib (25 mg daily) or placebo.\n168 At 24 \nweeks, a reduction of 15.6 points (95%  CI, -18.6 to - 12.6) from baseline in \nthe total symptom score was reported i n patients treated with avapritinib \ncompared to a reduction of 9.2 points (95% CI, -13.1 to - 5.2; P = .003)  in \nthose treated with placebo. Compared to patients treated with placebo, \nthose treated with avapritinib also achieved a 50% or greater decrease in \nserum tryptase level (54% vs. 0%; P  < .001), KIT D816V VAF in peripheral \nblood (68% vs. 6%; P  < .001), total symptom score (25% vs. 10%; P  = \n.005), and bone marrow mast cell burden (53% vs. 23%; P  < .001).  Grade \n3 or higher adverse events occurred at similar rates in both groups.  The \nmost common adverse events that occurred in the avapritinib group at a \nrate of two times or more than that of the placebo group included flushing \n(9.2% vs. 4.2%), peripheral edema (8.5% vs. 4.2%), face edema (7.1% vs. PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

The number of anaphylactic events in \nboth groups were low and the trial was not  powered to determine a \ndifference in the frequency of anaphylaxis between the two groups . \nAdvanced SM  \nData from the phase I EXPLORER trial, which cons isted of 53 evaluable \npatients with advanced SM (ASM, n = 3; SM-AHN, n = 37; MCL, n = 13 ) \ntreated with a dose of 30 to 400 mg once daily  (dose escalation and \nexpansion stages) , revealed an overall response rate ( ORR) of 75% (95% \nCI, 62%–86%) (100% [95% CI, 29% –100%] for ASM, 76% [95% CI, 59% –\n88%] for SM -AHN, and 69% [95% CI, 39% –91%] for MCL) , per the mIWG -\nMRT -ECNM response criteria .39 Ninety -two percent, 80%, and 99% of \npatients reported a 50% or greater decrease from baseline in bone \nmarrow mast cells, KIT D816V variant allele fraction, and serum tryptase, \nrespectively. A decrease of 35% or greater in spleen volume from baseline was obtained in 82 % of patients. Across all patients (n = 86), the most \ncommon grade 3 and above non- hematologic adverse events were fatigue \n(9%) and vomiting (5%) while the most common grade 3 and above \nnonhematologic adverse events were thrombocytopenia (34%), anemia \n(30%), and neutropenia (15%).  There were nine cases of intracranial \nbleeding (ICB) in patients with advanced SM (13% of 69 patients in the \nadvanced SM safety population), seven of which were associated with \nantecedent severe thrombocytopenia.  \nA pre -specified interim analysis of the phase II PATHFINDER trial , which \ncomprised  32 evaluable patients with advanced SM (ASM , n = 2; SM-\nAHN, n  = 26; MCL , n = 4) treated with avapritinib at a starting dose of 200 \nmg once daily, reported an ORR of 75%  (95% CI, 57 %–89%) , as \nassessed by the mIWG -MRT -ECNM response criteria .40 The ORR was \n100% (95% CI, 16% –100%), 81% (95% CI, 61% –93%), and 25% (1% –\n81%) in patients with ASM, SM -AHN, and MCL , respectively.  The safety population (n = 62) was used to assess secondary endpoints. Patients \nexperienced reduc tions in objective measures of mast cell disease burden. \nThe percentages of patients who achieved a 50% or greater decrease \nfrom baseline in bone marrow mast cells, KIT D816V variant allele \nfraction, and serum tryptase were 88%, 60%, and 93%, respectively. A decrease of 35% or greater in spleen volume from baseline was obtained \nin 66% of patients. An amelioration in patient -reported symptoms, as \nassessed by the AdvSM -SAF total symptom score, was also reported ( P < \n.001). The most common grade 3 or above hematologic adverse events \nwere  neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, and occurred in 24%, \n16%, and 16% of patients, respectively. The most common grade 3 or \nabove nonhematologic adverse events were increased blood ALP (5%) , \nperipheral edema (3%), periorbital edema (3%), and fatigue (3%) . The \nstudy reported one instance (1.6%) of ICB in a patient with severe \nthrombocytopenia at baseline. As patients with severe thrombocytopenia at baseline had an increased risk of ICB, the study protocols for both the \nEXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials were amended to exclude patients with platelet counts <50 x 10\n9/L as part of the  mitigation strate gies to \nreduce ICB .39,40 \nComparison between avapritinib and best available therapy was per\nformed in one retrospective study that pooled data from a multi -center \nstudy whereby patients with advanced SM were treated with best available \ntherapy and data from the EXPLORER and PATHFINDER trials.185 \nMedian OS was significantly improved in patients treated with avapritinib \n(49.0 months [95% CI, 46.9 months –not estimable] vs. 26.8 months [95% \nCI, 18.2 –39.7 months]; adjusted hazard ratio [ HR], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.29–\n0.79; P = .004).

Using modified Valent \nand Cheson response criteria, treatment with midostaurin (100 mg twice \ndaily) resulted in an ORR of 60% (45% of the patients had a major \nresponse, defined as complete resolution of at least one type of mastocytosis- related organ damage).\n38 Response rates were similar \nacross all subtypes of advanced SM, KIT  mutation status (63% for patients \nwho were KIT  D816V mutation- positive and 44% for those who were KIT  \nD816V mutation- negative or had unknown mutation status), or exposure to \nprevious therapy. The median OS and PFS were 29 months and 14 \nmonths, respectively. The median OS and PFS were longer for patients \nwith ASM (not reached and 29 months, respectively) than for patients with \nSM-AHN (21 months and 11 months, respectively) and MCL (9 months \nand 11 months, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, a subtype of advanced SM other than MCL and greater than or equal to 50% reduction \nof bone marrow mast cell burden were identified as independent predictors of longer OS. Low -grade nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were \nthe most frequent adverse events. New or worsening grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 24%, 41%, and \n29% of patients, respectively, and were more common in patients with \npre-existing cytopenias.  \nA study that evaluated the impact of KIT D816V mutation and other \nmolecular markers on the clinical outcome of 38 patients with advanced \nSM treated with midostaurin found that the ORR, median duration of \nmidostaurin treatment, and OS were significantly higher in patients with an \nS/A/R\nneg (vs. S/A/Rpos) mutation profile and in patients with a greater than \nor equal to 25% (vs. <25%) reduction in the RNA expressed allele burden.\n190 The acquisition of additional mutations in KRAS, NRAS, \nRUNX1 , IDH2 , or NPM1 genes was identified in patients with disease \nprogression. Another study reported an amelioration in the mast cell \nmediator -related symptoms in patients with advanced SM who were \ntreated with midostaurin.191  \nCladribine \nCladribine ( 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) is not approved by the FDA for SM, \nbut is used on an off -label basis because of its activity across all subtypes  \nof SM , including MCL refractory to prior cytoreductive therapy.169- 171 \nCladribine may be particularly useful for patients with advanced SM when \nrapid debulking of disease is required.  \nIn an analysis , treatment with cladribine resulted in an ORR of 56%, 50%, \nand 55% , in patients with ISM, ASM , and SM -AHN, respectively .170 The \npresence of circulating immature myeloid cells was a predictor of inferior response. In a  study that reported the long- term safety and efficacy of \ncladribine in 68 patients with SM, the ORR was 72%, split between 92% for patients with ISM (major/partial 56%/36%) and 50% for those with \nadvanced SM (major/partial 38%/13%).\n171 The median duration of \nresponse was 4 years and 3 years for ISM and ASM, respectively.

In the largest retrospective analysis that included \n57 patients with advanced SM (median age, 46 years; SM -AHN, n = 38; \nMCL, n = 12; ASM, n = 7), allogeneic HCT was associated with a 70% \nresponse rate (28% CR; 21% stable disease [ SD]) and the 3- year OS rate \nwas 57% for all patients (74% , 43%, and 17%  for patients with SM -AHN, \nASM, and MCL, respectively ).194 MCL subtype was the strongest risk \nfactor for poor OS. The role of allogeneic HCT needs to be determined in \na prospective trial. In 2024, best practice recommendations were \npublished for allogeneic HCT in patients with advanced SM.195 \nEvaluation for allogeneic HCT is a consideration for patients with \nadvanced SM  after adequate response to prior treatment . For patients with \nadvanced SM with inadequate response or loss response to prior  \ntreatment , second -line therapy and allogeneic HCT should be considered  \nafter re -staging. Among patients with SM -AHN, allogeneic HCT should \nalso be considered as part of initial treatment when the AHN component \nrequires HCT or if the AHN component progresses . Prophylactic \nanti-mediator drug  therapy (corticosteroids, anti histamines , anti-IgE \nantibody, and epinephrine) should be used as needed with the \nconditioning regimen.196 The role of KIT inhibitors in the post -transplant \nsetting to minimize relapse has not been formally studied.  \nResponse Criteria \nResponse criteria for advanced SM were first published in 2003 and were \nsubsequently modified in 2013 by the IWG -MRT and ECNM with the \naddition of more specific and quantifiable criteria to establish eligible organ PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

The IWG -MRT -\nECNM response criteria were subsequently modified, eg, mIWG -MRT -\nECNM and are currently being used in trials of KIT inhibitors in advanced \nSM.103 Treatment response criteria have also been published to adjudicate \nresponses in the AHN component.  \nThe revised 2013 IWG -MRT -ECNM response criteria delineated \ndefinitions for nonhematologic and hematologic organ damage eligible for response evaluation and adjudication of response.\n102 ANC, \ntransfusion- dependent and independent anemia, and thrombocytopenia \nare used for the assessment of hematologic organ damage. \nNonhematologic organ damage is assessed based on the presence of \nsymptomatic ascites or pleural effusion, liver function abnormalities, \nhypoalbuminemia, and symptomatic marked splenomegaly. The \ndevelopment of ascites usually reflects aggressive liver disease and may be accompanied by hepatomegaly, abnormal liver function test results , \nand/or portal hypertension. Hypoalbuminemia is indicative of worsening \nsynthetic function of the liver and/or worsening nutritional status due to \ngastrointestinal tract infiltration by neoplastic mast cells.  \nClinical improvement (CI) is defined as the resolution of greater than or \nequal to one finding of nonhematologic or hematologic organ damage \nwithout concomitant worsening of other eligible organ damage.\n102 CR \nand PR are defined based on the percent reduction in bone marrow mast \ncells and the reduction of serum tryptase levels.102 In addition, the \nachievement of a CR or PR also requires the resolution of all or at least one CI finding, respectively. Responses (resolution of findings of organ \ndamage as well as reduction in bone marrow mast cell burden and \nserum tryptase level) should be maintained or confirmed for a period of at least 12 weeks in order to fulfill the criteria for CI, CR , and PR. \nAdditional criteria are also included for PD, SD, and loss of response.  \nThe mIWG-MRT -ECNM criteria allow splenomegaly of greater than or \nequal to 5 cm to be considered an eligible organ damage finding (“C -\nfinding”) compared to the original IWG- MRT -ECNM criteria , which only \nallow symptomatic splenomegaly greater than 5 cm to be considered an \norgan damage finding.102-104 The other significant change is that a \nresponse definition of complete remission with partial hematologic \nrecovery (CRh) is now included, which is defined as a CR with the \nfollowing counts: ANC ≥0.5 x 109/L, Hb ≥8.0 g/dL, and platelet count ≥50 x \n109/L. The CRh category recognizes that in the  absence of evidence of \nSM due to successful treatment, persistently low blood counts may instead relate to treatment -associated myelosuppression or the presence \nof an AHN.  \nMore recently, consensus ECNM -AIM response criteria for advanced SM \nhave been developed.104 They include tiers of response to adjudicate \ndifferent aspects of the disease: Tier IA is SM pathologic response and is \nadjudicated by evaluat ing bone marrow mast cell burden, serum tryptase \nlevel , and CBC results (eg, CR or CRh allowed); in the context of clinical \ntrials, tier IA response serves as the primary endpoint. Tier IB is AHN \npathologic response; tier II is molecular response evaluating changes \nfrom baseline in KIT  D816V. Cytogenetic response, if abormal at \nbaseline, is also included in Tier II response; Tier III is clinical response  \n(based on mIWG -MRT -ECNM clinical improvement criteria), and Tier IV is \nsymptom/QOL  response. Tier IB through Tier IV are considered \nsecondary endpoints in the setting of clinical trials.The major aim of \nthese response criteria w as to de- couple SM pathologic response from \nclinical response (Tier III) since unresolved C -findings can \ninappropriately downgrade an otherwise complete histopathologic \nresponse (eg , CR or PR to SD) , which may underestimate clinical PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:08:20 PM.

In such cases, unresolved C-findings may reflect persistence of \nthe AHN or other comorbidities , or may reflect organ damage that is slow \nto reverse (or irreversible).  \nMonitoring Response and Additional Therapy  \nISM or SSM  \nHistory and physical exam ination, laboratory evaluation (annually for \npatients with ISM and every 6– 12 months for patients with SSM), baseline \nDEXA scan ( with serial evaluation based on severity and extent of bony \ndisease for patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis) , and assessment of \nsymptom burden and QOL using MSAF and MQLQ is recommended for \npatients with ISM and SSM.  \nAlthough increased serum beta- 2-microglobulin has been identified in one \nstudy as an independent predictor of disease progression in patients with \nISM, this is not routinely performed in clinical practice.15 Progressively \nincreasing serum tryptase levels have  been associated with disease \nprogression to SSM or ASM and shorter PFS in patients with ISM.198 \nPatients with ISM and SSM should also be monitored for the development \nof signs of disease progression to advanced SM (eg,  development of \nC-findings/organ damage).  \nAdvanced SM  \nBone marrow aspirate and biopsy with cytogenetics, serum tryptase level , \nand additional staging studies to document organ damage are recommended for patients with ASM, SM with AHN , and MCL, if supported \nby increased symptoms and signs of progression (return or progression of \nhematologic or nonhematologic organ damage; symptomatic or \nprogressive hepatomegaly or splenomegaly).\n102 Repeat NGS panel testing \nmay be considered to determine whether signs of disease progression are associated with the development of new mutations compared to baseline.  Biopsy of involved extramedullary organ may be considered to evaluate \nthe grade and extent of SM -related organ damage.\n102 Evaluation of organ \ndamage in SM with an AHN might require a tissue biopsy to ascertain the relationship between organ damage and burden of mast cell infiltration \nand/or AHN involvement.\n102 Additional staging studies include CBC for the \nevaluation of hematologic organ damage, liver functions tests (measurement of total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate \naminotransferase, and serum ALP [the most common SM -associated sign \nof hepatic damage]) for the evaluation of nonhematologic organ damage , \nand imaging studies (CT or MRI) to verify physical examination findings of \norgan involvement or organ damage.  \nKIT D816V  allele burden has been shown to correlate with serum tryptase \nlevels and response to cytoreductive therapy. While incorporated into \ncurrent clinical trials of KIT inhibitors , the role of KIT D816V  allele burden \nmonitoring during treatment has not been formally  established in clinical \npractice .\n199,200 \nAdditional Therapy  \nThe panel acknowledges that response criteria were developed mainly for \nuse in clinical trials and that clinical benefit may not reach the threshold of \nthese response criteria.102- 104 Response assessment should be based on \nthe improvement of symptoms related to mast cell mediator release  and \nSM-related organ damage at the discretion of the clinician.  \nContinuation of prior treatment is recommended for patients achieving \nadequate response to anti -mediator drug therapy ( symptomatic ISM or \nSSM) or cytoreductive therapy (advanced SM).

Second -line \ntherapy and allogeneic HCT should be considered. Clinical trials are  \nalways recommended for these orphan diseases, regardless of whether \npatients have ISM, SSM, or advanced forms of SM.  \nSpecial Considerations  \nSurgery  \nMast cell activation can occur in patients with mastocytosis undergoing \nsurgical procedures and the risk may persist for several hours after \nsurgery due to delayed mast cell mediator release.201 The primary goal is \nto prevent mast cell activation during and in the immediate aftermath of the surgical procedure. Multidisciplinary management is recommended \nwith the involvement of surgical, anesthesia,  and perioperative medical \nteams. Careful review of prior anesthetic records as well as identification and avoidance of known triggers for symptoms related to mast cell \nmediator release  (such as temperature extremes [hypothermia or \nhyperthermia] and unnecessary trauma) are strongly recommended.\n202  \nThe efficacy and safety of perioperative drugs in patients with SM has not \nbeen fully established, although anecdotal reports suggest that certain \nperioperative drugs are considered safer in patients with SM.203 \nNevertheless, the use of perioperative drugs is not contraindicated in patients with SM.\n202,204 While it is important that analgesics should not be \nwithheld from patients with SM (since pain can be a trigger for mast cell activation), caution should be exercised with the use of opioids (eg, \ncodeine or morphine).  Management of symptoms related to mast cell mediator release depends \non their severity. The use of benzodiazepines, anti -histamines (H1 and H2 \nblockers) , and corticosteroids is probably helpful in reducing the frequency \nand/or severity of symptoms related to mast cell mediator release .\n202,203 \nOther options include fluid resuscitation, intravenous epinephrine,  and \ndiscontinuation of the suspected drug or anesthetic agent.202 The risk of \nanaphylaxis in the perioperative period is estimated to be higher in \npatients with SM relative to the general population.204 In the event of \nanaphylaxis or other mast cell activation event, a full allergic workup \nshould be initiated.204,205 The workup should include skin tests or detection \nof specific IgE antibodies for the identification of IgE -mediated \nhypersensitivity to drugs and measurement of serum tryptase level within \n30 to 120 minutes of symptom onset and also after full recovery.202,203   \nPregnancy  \nAlthough mast cells have been associated with beneficial effects in early stages of pregnancy (in terms of implantation, placentation,  and fetal \ngrowth), in later stages of pregnancy, excessive release of mast cell \nmediators is associated with pre- term delivery.\n206 The diagnosis of SM \ndoes not appear to have any effect on fertility. There is limited evidence \nregarding the impact of mastocytosis on pregnancy compared to the \ngeneral population. Spontaneous miscarriages and worsening of \nsymptoms related to mast cell ac tivation have been reported in 20% to \n30% of pregnant females  with mastocytosis.207- 209 Symptoms related to \nmast cell mediator release have been observed in 11% of patients without \nany fatal outcome.209   \nSM is not a contraindication to a successful pregnancy. P atients  with SM \nwho are pregnant should be treate d by a multidisciplinary team, including \na high- risk obstetrician and anesthesiologist during the pre -conception, \npregnancy, and peripartum period.

Such patients should have two epinephrine autoinjector s \nwith them and should receive the vaccine at a location with emergency \nawareness  and that has equipment and drugs for resuscitation available. \nThese individuals  may also be evaluated by  skin testing for vaccine components, such as PEG or polysorbate 80/20 . Additionally, H1 \nantihistamine premedication should be used  in these patients  1 hour \nbefore receiving the vaccine.
