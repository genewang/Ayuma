NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion\nGeneral Principles\n• Frailty assessment should be considered in older adults. See NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology .\n• If candidates for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)\n\u0017Exposure to nucleoside analogs (fludarabine and cladribine) should be avoided.\n• Plasmapheresis\n\u0017In patients with symptomatic hyperviscosity, plasmapheresis should first be performed; plasmapheresis should also be considered before \ntreatment with Rituximab for patients with asymptomatic WM with an IgM ≥4000 mg/dL  or who are symptomatic to avoid aggravation of \nserum viscosity based on Rituximab-related IgM flare. Rituximab may also be held in patients with elevated serum IgM levels for initial \ntreatment cycles. Blood warmers should be used for apheresis if cryoprecipitate or cryoglobulin are present.\nScreening Recommendations\n• Screen for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, as clinically indicated. \nProphylaxis Recommendations\n• Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis should be considered for patients receiving Bendamustine/Rituximab or Fludarabine/\nCyclophosphamide/Rituximab. \n• Administer herpes zoster prophylaxis for all patients treated with proteasome inhibitors and nucleoside analogs. \n• Prophylactic antiviral therapy with entecavir is recommended for any patient who is hepatitis B surface antigen-positive and receiving anti-\nCD20 therapy. If there is active disease (PCR+), it is considered treatment/management and not prophylactic therapy. In cases of hepatitis B \ncore antibody positivity, prophylactic antiviral therapy is preferred; however, if there is a concurrent high-level hepatitis B surface antibody, \nthese patients may be monitored with serial hepatitis B viral load.\nSide Effects and Laboratory Tests\n• Carfilzomib can potentially cause cardiac and pulmonary toxicity, especially in older patients.\n• IgG levels should be carefully monitored as these can be depleted with WM therapies. See Prevention and Treatment of Cancer-Related \nInfections. \n• Regimens containing Bortezomib and Vincristine are associated with higher risk of treatment-related peripheral neuropathy, especially in \nthose with disease-related baseline neuropathy. Close monitoring or alternative therapies should be considered in some patients.\nDosing and Administration of Proteasome Inhibitors\n• Subcutaneous Bortezomib is the preferred method of administration.\n• Both weekly and twice-weekly dosing schemas of Bortezomib may be appropriate; weekly is preferred.\n• Carfilzomib may be used once (preferred) or twice weekly and at different doses. \nSubstitutions\n• A U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy \nin the NCCN Guidelines. \n• Rituximab and Hyaluronidase human injection for subcutaneous administration may be substituted for Rituximab after patients have \nreceived the first full dose of Rituximab by intravenous infusion.GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR SYSTEMIC THERAPY FOR WM/LPL\nWM/LPL-B\n1 OF 4PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:11 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nWaldenström Macroglobulinemia/ \nLymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma  \nMS-2 Overview \nWaldenström  macroglobulinemia (WM) is a B -cell disorder characterized \nprimarily by bone marrow infiltration with lymphoplasmacytic cells  (LPCs) \nand immunoglobulin M ( IgM) monoclonal gammopathy.1 This condition is \ndefined as “ lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma ” (LPL) by the Revised \nEuropean- American Lymphoma  (REAL) and World Health Organization \n(WHO ) classification systems.2,3 WM is a rare disorder with approximately \n1000 to 1500 new cases diagnosed annually  in the United States.4,5 \nReview of the SEER database between 1980 and 2016 showed that  \nwhite  individuals , those  assigned male at birth,  and individuals  aged  >60 \nyears  are more likely to develop WM .6 \nLiterature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update \nMethodology  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines \nin Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Waldenström  \nMacroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma, an electronic search \nof the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature in \nWM/LPL  using the following search terms: Waldenström  \nmacroglobulinemia OR lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.  The PubMed \ndatabase was chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for \nmedical literature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature .7  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in h umans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article types:  \nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial , Phase III ; Clinical Trial, Phase IV;  \nGuideline;  Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial ; Meta -\nAnalysis ; Systematic Reviews ; and Validation S tudies.   \nThe data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional \nsources deemed as relevant to these guidelines as discussed by the \nPanel during the Guidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high- level evidence is \nlacking are based on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and \nexpert opinion.  \nThe complete details of the D evelopment and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines® are available at www.NCCN.org .  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.  NCCN Guidelines endeavor  to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  NCCN \nGuidelines  incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guideli nes will \ncontinue to use the terms men , women , fema le, and male  when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender  from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use mor e inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nDiagnosis \nKey to the diagnosis of WM/LPL is the demonstration of bone marrow \ninfiltration by a LPC  population manifested by small lymphocytes with \nevidence of plasmacytoid/plasma cell differentiation. The bone marrow infiltration should be supported by immunophenotypic studies (flow PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:11 PM.

Laboratory studies include complete blood count (CBC) with \ndifferential, peripheral blood smear examination, and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), as well as creatinine clearance. CMP  includes \nserum blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine, electrolytes, albumin, calcium, and liver function tests (LFTs)  to assess kidney and liver \nfunction.\n12 Serum uric acid , lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) , and beta -2 \nmicroglobulin should also be included as  part of the initial workup to \nassess risk of tumor lysis, tumor burden, and as a prognostic indicator.13 \nTo establish the diagnosis of WM, it is necessary to demonstrate IgM monoclonal protein in the serum  and histologic evidence of LPCs  in the \nbone marrow.\n1 Serum protein electrophoresis  (SPEP) , serum quantitative \nimmunoglobulins, and serum immunofixation  electrophoresis (SIFE)  are \nused to identify and quantify the M -protein (IgM). While detection of a \nmonoclonal IgM protein in the serum is a diagnostic criterion for WM, this \nmonoclonal IgM may be found clinically either in the setting of clinical WM, \nIgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (IgM MGUS), \nor IgM multiple myeloma. It is important to make this distinction during \ndiagnosis. Approximately 5% of patients with LPL can secrete non- IgM paraproteins (eg, IgG, IgA, kappa, lambda) or be non- secretory and \nshould have LPL managed like WM . \nThe International Prognostic Scoring System for WM (IPSS- WM) is useful  \nfor prognostication of WM  at first- line treatment initiation.14,15 Its value in \nmaking treatment -related decisions remains to be clarified.14 \nBone marrow is almost always involved in WM ; therefore , a unilateral \nbone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed to document clonal LPC population and confirmed by immunohistochemistry and/or flow \ncytometry.\n1,8 Multiparametric flow cytometry may provide additional data \non the immunophenotypic characterization of WM.16 \nThe bone marrow aspirate should be tested for MYD88  L265P mutation. \nWhole genome sequencing of bone marrow LPL cells has identified MYD88  L265P as a commonly recurring mutation in patients with  \nWM.\n11,17,18 Absence of MYD88  mutations should not be used to exclude \ndiagnosis of WM if  other criteria are met.19 The NCCN Panel recommends \nallele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS -PCR) for MYD88  L265P  \ndetection.   \nCT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast  \nand/or FDG -PET/CT at time of diagnosis are useful to properly stage the \npatient and can assess adenopathy, splenomegaly, and other \nextramedullary disease sites.  \nTests Useful Under Certain Circumstances  \nIgM is a pentamer and a common cause of hyperviscosity. Therefore, \nevaluation for characteristic clinical signs and symptoms of serum \nviscosity should be done at diagnosis. Many  patients with WM will  exhibit \nan elevated serum viscosity level of >1.8 centipoise (cP). Patients typically \nbecome symptomatic at serum viscosity levels of >4.0 cP.

In up to 20% of patients  with \nWM, the monoclonal IgM may behave as a cryoglobulin (type I)  but will be  \nsymptomatic in ≤5% of cases. The presence of cold agglutinins or \ncryoglobulins may affect determination of IgM levels ; therefore, testing for \ncold agglutinins and cryoglobulins should be performed at diagnosis.23 \nNotably, cold agglutinins are also a key feature of primary cold agglutinin \ndisease (CAD), part of the differential diagnosis of WM.24,25  \nGene testing for  the CXCR4 mutation may be useful if patients are  \nconsidered for Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis).26 CXCR4 \nmutations are present in ≤40% of patients with WM  and are indicative of \nmore aggressive disease. These mutations have a reduced sensitivity towards certain BTKis, specifically ibrutinib.  \nWhen suspected, cryocrit, a test for cryoglobulins , should be obtained. \nThe presence of cryoglobulins m ay render falsely low serum IgM levels . \nIn such situation s, maintaining the serum sample in a warm bath will \nprovide a more relia ble serum IgM level measurement .\n27 Hepatitis C \nvirus (HCV) should also be ruled out if cryoglobulinemia is suspected.28 \nSerologic screening  for hepatitis B  virus  (HBV)  is recommended, as \ncertain agents, specifically rituximab, are known to induce  severe, and \npotentially fatal,  viral reactivation .29 Individuals may also be screened for \nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)  as part of the workup .  Coagulation studies and/or von Willebrand disease testing can be considered if the patient presents with excessive bruising or bleeding, or \nif otherwise clinically indicated. \nTwenty -four-hour urine for total protein, creatinine clearance , urine \nprotein electrophoresis (UPEP), and urine immunofixation \nelectrophoresis (UIFE)  may be useful.  \nPatients with WM and peripheral neuropathy may harbor antibodies \nagainst myelin- associated glycoprotein (MAG) or other glycoproteins or \nlipids.\n23,30   \nSerum anti -MAG  antibodies can be evaluated in patients with sensory \nperipheral neuropathies31; in those with motor neuropathy, anti -ganglioside \nM1 antibodies may also be evaluated. In patients with peripheral \nneuropathy, referral s for neurologic consultation should be considered . \nNerve conduction studies (NCS) or electromyography (EMG) may help \ndetermine if neuropathy  is related  to the monoclonal process or other \ncauses .32 Fat pad sampling and/or congo red staining of bone marrow for \namyloid can also be performed in patients with suspected disease related \nto peripheral neuropathy. Amyloidosis should be ruled out in those presenting with nephrotic syndrome or unexplained cardiac conditions. If \nindicated, amyloid tissue subtyping with mass spectrometry may be \nperformed.  \nThe median age at the time of WM diagnosis ranges from  60 to 75 \nyears.23,33,34 Therefore, f railty assessment should be considered prior to \ntreatment of older adults with WM as per  the NCCN Guidelines for Older \nAdult Oncology  (available at NCCN.org ). \nThe manifestation of neurologic deficits is  ambiguous and could be the \nresult of  underlying comorbidities.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nWaldenström Macroglobulinemia/ \nLymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma  \nMS-5 individuals with WM; imaging  studies, cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF) analysis, \nor tissue biopsy are needed to investigate  Bing-Neel syndrome  (BNS) .  \nAsymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic \nWM may be preceded by asymptomatic disease states such as IgM \nMGUS or smoldering WM (SWM).35 Approximately 1.5%  of patients with \nIgM MGUS and 12% of those with SWM have disease progression to WM \nper year.11,36- 38 The risk of disease progression is estimated using an \nasymptomatic risk score calculator , which takes the following diagnostic \nmeasurements into consideration: bone marrow involvement (%), serum \nIgM level (mg/dL ), serum beta -2 microglobulin level (mg/dL ), and serum \nalbumin level (g/dL ). 3 Based on the risk score, the risk of disease \nprogression is categorized as  low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk, \nwith a median time to progression to symptomatic disease of 9.2 years, \n4.8 years, and 1.8 years, respectively. The frequency of follow- up varies \nbased on the risk status. Follow -up includes monitoring with diagnostic \ntesting,  including CBC, CMP, SPEP, and serum immunoglobulins, every \n12 months for low risk, every 6 months for intermediate risk, and every 3 months for high risk.  \nPrimary T herapy Regimens for WM/LPL  \nAccording to the NCCN WM/LPL Panel, treatment should be initiated for \npatients with a diagnosis of WM/LPL only in those who are symptomatic. \nThe indicative symptoms of  treatment include hyperviscosity; neuropathy; \nsymptomatic adenopathy or organomegaly; amyloidosis; cryoglobulinemia; \ncold agglutinin disease; anemia; B-symptoms ; and presence of \ncytopenia.14,39- 41 Importantly, high IgM level  by itself  should not be \nconsidered a criterion for initiation of therapy in the absence of other \nindications.  The NCCN Panel notes that it is important to rule out \nsymptoms related to comorbidities before treatment initiation and \ndetection of cold agglutinins or cryoglobulins in the absence of symptoms does not represent a criterion to treat , whereas treatment should be \nconsidered in asymptomatic patients with serum IgM level >6000 mg/dL.   \nSince WM is a rare disease, few randomized trials and limited data \ncomparing different treatment approaches exist . Therefore,  the treatment \nfor WM has been primarily adopted from data derived from phase II or \nretrospective studies .  \nAccording to the NCCN Panel, for patients requiring immediate disease \ncontrol, such as those with symptomatic hyperviscosity,  initial \nplasmapheresis is recommended.42 After plasmapheresis, systemic \ntreatment should be initiated as soon as possible.  \nAgents that limit future treatment options should be avoided during initial therapy. Exposure to continuous oral alkylator therapy or nucleoside \nanalogs should be avoided prior to stem cell harvest if a n autologous  \nhematopoietic  cell transplant ( HCT) is being considered. Nucleoside \nanalogs are associated with an increased risk of disease transformation, \ndevelopment of myelodysplastic syndromes  (MDS),  and secondary acute \nmyelo id leukemia (AML ).\n43,44 \nThe NCCN Panel recommends serial monitoring of serum IgA and IgG \nlevels during therapy.  Herpes zoster prophylaxis should be considered for \npatients  receiving proteasome inhibitor -based regimens and nucleoside \nanalogs . \nHBV reactivation is common in patients with hematologic malignancies.  \nThe NCCN P anel recommends screening for HBV infection by testing for \nhepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibody to hepatitis B core \nantibody  (HBcAb) as clinically indicated.  Prophylactic antiviral therapy with \nentecavir is recommended for those who have HB cAb to prevent HBV \nreactivation. In those with resolved HBV infection, who have antibodies  to \nHBcA g, the P anel prefers prophylaxis with antiviral therapy.

The NCCN Panel has categorized WM therapy regimens as : \n“preferred regimens,” “other recommended  regimens, ” and regimens \n“useful under certain circumstances.”  The purpose of classifying regimens \nis to provide guidance on treatment selection considering the relative \nefficacy,  toxicity, and other factors that play into treatment selection, such \nas pre -existing comorbidities ( eg, peripheral neuropathy, rituximab \nintolerance). The  NCCN Panel Members strongly encourage treatment in \nthe context of a clinical trial when possible.   \nPreferred Regimens for Primary Therapy  \nBendamustine/Rituximab : Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets \nthe B -lymphocyte antigen CD20, has been used in the treatment of WM, \nbecause CD20 is expressed on LPCs  in patients  with WM. Bendamustine, \nan alkylating agent caus ing crosslinks in DNA bases  resulting in \napoptosis, is frequently used in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)  and \nindolent B- cell non- Hodgkin lymphoma  (NHL) .45 A multicenter study by  the \nFrench Innovative Leukemia Organization (FILO)  showed favorable \noutcomes in 69 patients with WM, treated with bendamustine  and \nrituximab  (BR).46 Progression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) \nafter 5 years were 6.63% (95% CI , 56.09– 79.17)  and 80.01% (95% CI , \n70.82– 90.41) , respectively. The Study Group Indolent  Lymphomas (Sti L) \nexamined the activity of bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) versus \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximab \n(RCHOP ) in a large , randomized, multicenter , phase III trial of previously \nuntreated patients with indolent NHL .47 Included in this study were 41 \npatients with WM/LPL, 40 of whom were available for response assessment.\n47 After a  median follow -up of 45 months , the median PFS  was significantly longer with BR treatment , 69.5 versus 28.5 months with \nRCHOP .48 BR was associated with a lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 \nneutropenia, infectious complications, and alopecia in this study. These results suggest that BR may be a preferable option to RCHOP  as primary  \ntherapy for WM.\n48 The results of the StiL NHL- 2008 MAINTAIN trial, \ndemonstrate a median PFS of  65.3 months  in those receiving BR, which  is \nconsistent with the results of the StiL NHL1 -2003 trial (69.5 months) .49 \nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis should be considered \nfor patients receiving BR.  \nThe NCCN Panel has included BR as a P referred Regimen for Primary \nTherapy.   \nIbrutinib With or W ithout Rituximab : Signal ing pathways  from the B -cell \nantigen receptor and BTK are crucial in mediat ing the growth and survival \nof B-cell malignancies .50-53 \nA phase II study of 30 treatment -naïve patients with WM treated with \nibrutinib  monotherapy reported an ORR of 100%, a very good partial \nresponse ( VGPR ) rate of 30%, and a 48 -month PFS rate of 76%.52 \nAdverse events (AEs) associated with ibrutinib include bleeding and \narrhythmia. Ibrutinib is approved by the FDA as single- agent therapy for \npatients with WM until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.    \nThe phase III iNNOVATE trial (n  = 150) compared patients  with newly \ndiagnosed and relapsed/refractory WM treated with ibrutinib/rituximab or \nrituximab plus placebo.53 At 30 months of follow -up, the ibrutinib/rituximab \ntreatment showed an ORR of 95% compared with 48% in those treated \nwith rituximab/placebo. In newly diagnosed patients, treatment with \nibrutinib/rituximab demonstrated an improved PFS at 24 months ( 84%) \ncompared to the rituximab arm  (59%) (hazard ratio [ HR], 0.34; 95% CI , \n0.12– 0.95).53 The rituximab- induced infusion reactions were markedly PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:11 PM.

The estimated 54- month PFS rates were 68% with \nibrutinib/rituximab versus 25% with rituximab/placebo. Median OS was not reached in either treatment arm (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.33– 1.99; P = .64). \nThe ORR was 92% with ibrutinib/rituximab versus 44% with  \nrituximab/placebo. CXCR4  mutations affected VGPR rates (23% vs. 44%) \nbut did not impact PFS. The most common grade 3/4 AEs  with \nibrutinib/rituximab over the 5- year study period were infections (29%), \natrial fibrillation (16%), hypertension (15%), neutropenia (13%), anemia (12%), and pneumonia (11%).\n55 \nThe NCCN Panel has included ibrutinib with or without rituximab as a Preferred Regimen for Primary Therapy (category 1) .  \nZanubrutinib: Zanubrutinib is a BTK i with a higher affinity to BTK than \nibrutinib . In the phase III ASPEN trial, 201 patients with treatment -naïve or \nrelapsed/refractory WM were randomized 1:1 to receive either \nzanubrutinib or ibrutinib . All patients had a MYD88 (L265P)  mutation and \n26% had a CXCR4  mutation. There was no statistical difference in VGPR \nbetween the zanubrutinib and ibrutinib groups (28% vs. 19%; P  = .09).\n56 \nThe 42- month PFS rate for zanubrutinib was 78% and for ibrutinib was \n70% (HR, 0.63; 95% CI , 0.36– 1.12).57 Zanubrutinib induced higher VGPR \n(21% vs. 10%) and 42 -month PFS rates (73% vs. 49%) than ibrutinib in \npatients with CXCR4  mutations.  \nThe ASPEN safety data comparing zanubrutinib monotherapy showed a \ndecrease in the incidence of atrial fibrillation ( 4% vs. 1 7%) and a lower \nincidence in most non -hematologic AEs compared with ibrutinib. The \nincidence of hematologic AEs was similar except for  neutropenia, in which \nzanubrutinib was associated with a two-fold likelihood of any grade (29% vs. 13%) and grade ≥ 3 (20% vs. 8%) neutropenia compared to ibrutinib. A \nlarger proportion of patients received granulocyte colony -stimulating factor  \n(G-CSF)  with zanubrutinib compared to ibrutinib.56  \nThe NCCN Panel has included zanubrutinib as a Preferred Regimen for Primary Therapy (category 1).  \nOther Recommended Regimen s for Primary Therapy  \nBendamustine: Based on the durable responses seen in previously treated \nWM, as monotherapy in rituximab -intolerant individuals,58 bendamustine \nhas been included as an option for primary therapy for WM. It is also a \nUseful in Certain Circumstances therapy option in patients previously \ntreated for WM.  \nBortezomib/Dexamethasone/Rituximab : Bortezomib has shown activity in \nthe management of WM as  a single agent,59 in combination with \nrituximab,60 or in combination with rituximab and dexamethasone.61,62 \nThe study by Waldenström  Macroglobulinemia Clinical Trials Group \n(WMCTG) reported an overall response rate (ORR) of 96%, including 83% \nof patients achieving a partial response (PR) with the combination of IV \nbortezomib (using a twice-a- week schedule) , along with rituximab and \ndexamethasone (BDR) in newly diagnosed patients with WM.61 With a \nmedian follow -up of 2 years, 80% of patients remained free of disease \nprogression, including all patients achieving a VGPR  or better. However, \ngrade 3 peripheral neuropathy was observed in 30% of patients.  The \ndevelopment of peripheral neuropathy led to premature discontinuation of bortezomib in 61% of patients in this study.  \nIn another multicenter phase II trial, the activity of BDR (using once -\nweekly IV bortezomib) was evaluated in 59 newly diagnosed symptomatic patients with WM.\n63 The ORR (including  major and minimal \nresponse) was 85% (major response rate included: 3% complete PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:11 PM.

In 11% of patients, an increase \nof IgM (≥25%) was observed after the administration  of rituximab. After \n32 months of follow -up, median PFS was 42 months , and 3 -year OS was \n81%. Peripheral neuropathy was observed in 46% (grade ≥3 in 7%) of \npatients; 8% discontinued bortezomib due to neuropathy.63  \nNeuropathy is a primary toxicity observed with bortezomib- based \nregimens. Therefore, evaluation of patients for the development of \nbortezomib- related peripheral or autonomic neuropathy is important. \nAdministering bortezomib subcutaneously and once weekly reduces the \nrisk of peripheral neuropathy.  Therefore, this is the preferred method of \nadministration. While both weekly and twice- weekly dosing schemas of \nbortezomib are appropriate, the  weekly schema is preferred.  \nThe NCCN Panel has included b ortezomib/ dexamethasone/ rituximab  as \na treatment option under Other Recommended Regimens for Primary \nTherapy.  \nCarfilzomib/Rituximab/Dexamethasone:  A prospective phase II study \nstudied the combination of c arfilzomib/rituximab/d examethasone in newly \ndiagnosed patients who are symptomatic (n = 31) with WM/LPL.64 Long-\nterm follow -up demonstrated an ORR of 87% and a median PFS of 46 \nmonths.65 The study found that the response to this regimen was not \nimpacted by MYD88  (L265P ) mutation status. Rituximab- associated IgM \nflare (increase of IgM ≥25%) was observed in 23 % of patients. No \nsignificant peripheral neuropathy was observed in this study. IgA and IgG depletion were commonly observed and necessitated truncation of therapy \nand/or IV Ig use in several patients.\n64  \nThe NCCN Panel has included carfil zomib/rituximab/dexamethasone as a \ntreatment option under Other Recommended Regimens for Primary \nTherapy and noted under general considerations that it can potentially \ncause cardiac and pulmonary toxicity, especially in older patients.  Ixazomib/Rituximab/Dexamethasone : A prospective phase II study of \npatients (n = 26) with symptomatic WM  studied the combination of \nixazomib/rituximab/dexamethasone and found this regimen to be safe and effective as a primary therapy option.\n66 All enrolled patients had the \nMYD88  (L265P ) mutation, and 58% had a CXCR4 mutation. The median \ntime to response was 8 weeks . The overall  major and VGPR rates were \n96%, 77%, and 19%, respectively, and the median time to response was 8 \nweeks.66 The median PFS was 40 months, median duration of response \n(DOR) was 38 months, and the median time to next treatment (TTNT) was 40 months. PFS, DOR, and TTNT were not affected by CXCR4  mutational  \nprofile.\n67 \nThe NCCN Panel has included ixazomib/rituximab/dexamethasone as a \ntreatment option under Other Recommended Regimens for Primary \nTherapy.  \nRituximab : Single -agent rituximab is active in patients with WM; however, \nthe response rates of single -agent rituximab using  either standard or \nextended dosing vary between 25% and 45%.44,68,69  Transient increases in \nIgM levels  (also called the IgM flare) have been reported in 40% to 50% of \npatients after initiation of rituximab therapy.70,71  The rituximab- related IgM \nflare may lead to symptomatic hyperviscosity, as well as worsening of IgM -\nrelated neuropathy, cryoglobulinemia, and other IgM -related \ncomplications.  These levels may persist for months and do not indicate \ndisease progression but may necessitate plasmapheresis to reduce IgM \nlevels . Prophylactic plasmapheresis can be considered in patients with \nhigh IgM levels (typically ≥4000 mg/dL)72 before rituximab exposure to \nminimize the risk of symptomatic IgM flare . The risk of IgM flare may be \ndecreased in patients receiving rituximab in combination with other \nagents .61 Rituximab may be reasonable for treating patients with IgM anti -\nMAG antibody -related neuropathies.73  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:11 PM.

The 2-\nyear PFS was 67% for all evaluable individuals  and 80% for  those whose \ndisease responded to R- CD. The R -CD regimen was well- tolerated, with \n9% of those experiencing grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and approximately \n20% of individuals  experiencing some form of toxicity related to \nrituximab .74 The 8- year OS  rates based on the IPSS -WM risk status  for \nWM were  100%, 55%, and 27% for low -, intermediate- , and high-risk \ndisease, respectively ( P = .005).75 In a retrospective analysis of outcomes \nafter treatment with R -CD in 50 people with untreated WM, the ORR was \n96% and the median PFS was 34 months. The response rate and DOR  \nwere independent of MYD88  mutational  status.76 \nA prospective randomized, phase III , open- label clinical trial evaluated the \nefficacy and safety of R -CD versus R- CD plus bortezomib in 204 \ntreatment -naïve patients with WM.77 The 2 -year PFS was 80.6% (95% CI, \n69.5– 88.0)  and 72.8% (95% CI, 61.3– 81.3)  for R -CD plus bortezomib  and \nR-CD, respectively. Results also indicated a shorter median time to first \nresponse at 3 months for R -CD plus bortezomib versus 5.5 months for R-\nCD. Both regimens were well tolerated, with grade ≥3 AEs occurring in \n49.2% of participants.  \nThe NCCN Panel has included R- CD with or without bortezomib  as a \ntreatment option under Other Recommended Regimens for Primary \nTherapy.  \nRituximab/Cyclophosphamide/Prednisone : The use of \ncyclophosphamide/prednisone/rituximab  (CP-R) has been shown to be \nanalogous to the more intense cyclophosphamide -based regimens with \nlesser treatment -related complications.78 A single institutional retrospective \nstudy examined the outcomes of symptomatic patients with WM who received RCHOP  (n = 23), cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone plus \nrituximab (CVP -R; n = 16), or CP -R (n = 19). Baseline characteristics were \nsimilar for all three cohorts except for serum IgM levels, which were higher in patients treated with R CHOP ( P ≤ .015). The ORR and CR to the three \nregimens were: R CHOP (ORR, 96%; CR, 17%); CVP -R (ORR, 88%; CR, \n12%); and CP -R (ORR, 95%; CR, 0%). A higher incidence for neutropenic \nfever and treatment -related neuropathy were reported for R CHOP and \nCVP-R versus CP -R (P < .03).\n78 \nMaintenance Therapy : Retrospective data supported PFS and OS benefits  \nwith maintenance rituximab after a rituximab -containing regimen.79,80 \nHowever , a recent phase III study in WM patients who attained PR or \nbetter after six cycles of  BR did not show PFS or OS benefit  of \nmaintenance rituximab over observation following induction therapy .49 In \nthe subset analysis, patients >65 years and patients with high IPSS  risk \nfor WM may have benefited from maintenance.49   \nAssessment of Response to Primary Treatment  \nResponse to therapy in WM is defined by reduction in the IgM  protein. \nAccording to the updated summary of response categories from the \nEleventh International Workshop on  Waldenstr öm’s Macroglobulinemia,81 \na minor response is an IgM reduction of ≥ 25%; a PR is defined as  a ≥50% \nreduction in Ig M  a VGPR  is a ≥90% reduction in IgM  and a CR is \nimmunofixation negativity in the serum  along with resolution of \nextramedullary disease and clearance of the bone marrow. Stable disease \nis defined as a <25% reduction and <25% increase of serum IgM by \nelectrophoresis without progression of adenopathy/organomegaly, cytopenias, or clinically significant symptoms due to disease and/or signs \nof WM . Progressive disease is defined as a 25% increase in serum IgM by \nprotein electrophoresis confirmed by a second measurement.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nWaldenström Macroglobulinemia/ \nLymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma  \nMS-10 included in the NCCN Guidelines (see IWWM -11 Response Criteria for \nAssessment of Disease Response in WM/LPL in the algorithm ).  \nAn important concern with the use of IgM as a surrogate marker of \ndisease is that it can fluctuate independently  of tumor cell killing . \nRituximab induces a spike or flare in serum IgM levels that  can occur \nwhen used as monotherapy and in combination with other agents and \nlasts for several weeks to months .23,70,71 Conversely , bortezomib and \nibrutinib  can suppress IgM levels independent of killing tumor cells in \ncertain patients.82,83 One study showed that residual IgM -producing \nplasma cells are spared and persist in patients treated with selective B -\ncell–depleting agents such as rituximab, thus potentially skewing the \nrelative response and assessment to treatment.84 Therefore, in \ncircumstances where  the serum IgM levels appear to be out of context \nwith the patient's clinical progress , a bone marrow biopsy should be \nconsidered to clarify the patient's underlying disease burden.  \nFollow -up After Primary Treatment  \nAfter primary therapy, the NCCN P anel recommends assessing the \nresponse to treatment using consensus Panel criteria outlined on  IWWM -\n11 Response Criteria for Assessment of Disease Response in WM/LPL in \nthe algorithm .  \nThe goal of treatment is symptom relief and reducing the risk of organ \ndamage. When assessing responses, it is important to recognize that with \nsome agents, responses (reduction of IgM) to initial therapies are often \ndelayed and may result in underestimation of response.   \nIf the primary treatment was with a  fixed -duration chemoimmunotherapy \nregimen, patients should be observed for disease progression with tests including CBC, CMP, and IgM every 3 months for 2 years, then every  4–6 \nmonths for an additional 3 years, then every 6– 12 months.  Without symptoms, progression based on serum IgM levels alone should not be a \nreason to restart treatment.  \nIf treatment is initiated with a BTK i regimen, treatment should be continued \nuntil symptomatic disease progress ion (beyond biochemical progression)  \nor unacceptable toxicity. Rapid increases in IgM levels (IgM rebound) have \nbeen observed following discontinuation of BTK is. Consider continuing \ntherapy with the BTK i until starting the next line of therapy or monitor for \nIgM rebound after discontinuing BTKis . \nIf symptoms persist or there is no response to primary treatment, an \nalternate therapy may be administered. If there is disease transformation, \nsee Histologic Transformation of Indolent Lymphomas to DLBCL  in the \nNCCN Guidelines for B -Cell Lymphomas .  \n \nTherapy for Previously Treated WM  \nMany patients inevitably experience relapse after initial therapy and \nrequire further treatment.85 According to the NCCN Guidelines, \nadministering the same regimen used for primary treatment is reasonable \nas therapy for relapsed disease,  especially if the regimen was we ll-\ntolerated and the patient had a prolonged response. The P anel notes that \ncaution should be used when re- treating with myelosuppressive regimens \ndue to cumulative toxicities.  \nFor patients with remissions lasting <24 months or who show progressive \ndisease/resistance to a first -line regimen, second- line treatment may \ninclude agents of a different class of drugs, either alone or in combination. \nIn addition, it is important to avoid exposure to stem cell -damaging agents, \nsuch as an alkylator  or nucleoside analogs, in patients who are candidates \nfor autologous H CT. Regimens that are not toxic to stem cells must be \noffered, especially if stem cells have not previously been harvested.  All \nregimens listed under primary treatment options are effective options for \nconsideration in patients with previously treated WM .

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nWaldenström Macroglobulinemia/ \nLymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma  \nMS-11 Preferred R egimens for Previously Treated WM/LPL  \nBendamustine/ Rituximab : Bendamustine- based therapy is effective in \nrelapsed/refractory WM because it produces high and durable response \nrates . A phase II study of patients with relapsed/refractory WM who \nreceived bendamustine -based therapy reported an ORR of 83.3%.58 The \nmedian PFS in patients with refractory WM/LPL was 13.2 months.58 A \nphase I/II study  analyzed the outcome of BR  in patients with \nrelapsed/refractory WM. Patients had previously received a median \nnumber of 2 lines of treatment (range 1– 5). The ORR reported was \n80.2%.86 Another study evaluated the efficacy of BR and R- CD. Of the 160 \npatients, 60 received BR (43 with relapsed/refractory WM) , and 100 \nreceived R -CD (50 had relapsed/refractory WM). In patients with \nrelapsed/refractory WM, ORR with BR was 95% versus 87% with R -CD \n(P = .45 ); median PFS with BR was 58 versus 32 months with R -CD (2 -\nyear PFS was 66% vs. 53%; P  = .08).87  \nBendamustine combined with rituximab is listed as one of the preferred \noptions for relapsed/refractory disease and single -agent  bendamustine is \nlisted under Useful in Certain Circumstances  in the algorithm.  \nIbrutinib  With or Without Rituximab : A phase II trial of  ibrutinib \nmonotherapy in patients with symptomatic WM (n = 63) who received at \nleast one prior treatment reported an ORR of 90% (10 with a VGPR, 36 \nwith a PR, 11 with a minor response, and none with a CR) and a median \ntime to response of 4 weeks.88 At 5 years, the PFS and OS rates were \n54% and 87%, respectively.89 CXCR4  mutations adversely impacted time \nto response, depth of response , and PFS duration. Treatment -related \ntoxic effects of grade 3 or higher included neutropenia (in 16% of \npatients) and thrombocytopenia (in 11% of patients).89  \nThe results of the phase  III iNNOVATE  trial that included  patients with \nrelapsed/refractory WM  (trial details listed under Primary Therapy for WM/LPL  in the algorithm ) showed the benefit of adding ibruti nib to \nrituximab.  \nBased on the above trials , the NCCN Panel has added ibrutinib with or \nwithout rituximab as one of the Preferr ed Regimens for Therapy for \nPreviously Treated WM/LPL (category 1).  \nRituximab/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone : A phase II study \ninvestigated symptomatic patients with WM  (n = 100), of whom  50 patients \nreceived at least one cycle of  therapy  for relapsed/refractory WM  and 50 \npatients received at least one cycle of the same regimen for newly \ndiagnosed WM .76 In the relapsed/refractory setting,  the median PFS \nreported was 32 months (95% CI , 15–51) with 2- and 4- year PFS rates of \n54% and 34%, respectively.76 \nThe NCCN Panel has included R-CD as one of the Preferred  Regimens \nfor Therapy for Previously Treated WM/LPL . \nZanubrutinib: Based on the phase III ASPEN trial results  that included \nrelapsed/refractory WM (trial details listed under Primary Therapy for \nWM/LPL  in the algorithm ), the NCCN Panel has included zanu brutinib as \none of the Preferred Regimens for Therapy for Previously Treated \nWM/LPL (category 1).  \nOther Recommended R egimens for Previously Treated WM/LPL \nAcalabrutinib: Acalabrutinib is another BTKi that  may be considered. A \nsingle -arm phase II trial analyzed the usage of acalabrutinib in 106 \npatients with treatment -naïve or relapsed/refractory WM. Out of the total \n106 enrolled, 14 patients (13%) were treatment- naïve, 41 patients (39%) \nhad received ≥ 3 prior therapies, and 33 patients (31%) had refractory \ndisease. In treatment -naïve patients, the 24- month OS was 92% and the \n24-month PFS was 90%.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nWaldenström Macroglobulinemia/ \nLymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma  \nMS-12 was 89% and the 24 -month PFS was 82%. The most common grade 3/4 \nAEs were neutropenia (16%), pneumonia (7%), anemia (5%), and lower \nrespiratory tract infection (5%).90  \nThe NCCN Panel has included acalabrutinib as a treatment option under \nOther Recommended Regimens for Previously Treated WM/LPL.   \nBortezomib/Dexamethasone/Rituximab : The use of bortezomib as \ntherapy for relapsed disease is associated with an ORR of 60% when \nadministered as a single agent, and of 70% to 80% when in combination \nwith rituximab59,82,83,91 -93 with or without dexamethasone.94 Grade 3 \nperipheral neuropathy may occur in 30% of patients using the twice -a-\nweek dosing schedule of bortezomib and in 10% of patients receiving \nonce -a-week dosing.  Bortezomib/dexamethasone/rituximab is listed as \none of the Other Recommended Regimens for Primary Therapy as well \nas Previously Treated WM/LPL.  \nIxazomib/ Rituximab/ Dexamethasone : The results of a phase I/II study in \npatients (n = 59) who had received a median of two prior therapies \ntreated with ixazomib/rituximab/dexamethasone showed an ORR of 71% \n(14% VGPR , 37% PR, and 20% minor response) after 8 cycles.95 The \nmedian DOR  reported was  36 months. The PFS and OS  were 56% and \n88%, respectively , after a median follow -up of 24 months.95 \nBased on these data, the NCCN Panel has included \nixazomib/rituximab/dexamethasone  as a treatment option under Other \nRecommended Regimens for Previously Treated WM/LPL. \nRituximab/ Cyclophosphamide/ Prednisone : A retrospective study \nexamined the outcomes of patients with WM who received three  separate \nrituximab -based regimens : RCHOP  (n = 23), CVP -R (n = 16), or CP -R (n = \n19).78 The results reported the following ORR and CR rates to the  \nregimens : RCHOP  (ORR, 96%; CR, 17%); CVP -R (ORR , 88%; CR , 12%); and CP-R (ORR, 95%; CR, 0%). Therapy -related AEs such as \nneutropenic fever and treatment -related neuropathy were higher for \nRCHOP  and CV P-R compared with  CP-R (P < .03).78 \nThe NCCN Panel has included CP -R as a treatment option under Other \nRecommended Regimens for Previously Treated WM/LPL.   \nVenetoclax : Venetoclax is an oral BCL2 antagonist approved for the \ntreatment of CLL and AML. BCL2 is an anti -apoptotic protein that is shown \nto be overexpressed in primary WM cells.96 A phase II trial analyzed \nvenetoclax monotherapy in 33 patients with previously treated WM. All patients had a MYD88  (L265P) mutation,  and 17 patients (53%) had a \nCXCR4  mutation. At median follow- up of 33 months, the median PFS was \n30 months. At time of data cutoff, the 30- month OS was 100% and the \nORR was 84%. There was no difference in major response rate nor PFS on the basis of CXCR4  mutational status. The most common grade 3/4 AE  \nwas neutropenia (42%).\n97 The NCCN Panel has included venetoclax as a \ntreatment option under Other Recommended Regimens for Previously \nTreated WM/LPL.  \nRegimens Useful in C ertain Circumstances for Previously Treated \nWM/LPL  \nCladribine Alone or with Rituximab: Cladribine, a nucleoside analogue, \nhas been studied alone or in combination with rituximab and found to \ninduce good ORRs with prolonged survivals.98-100 In a phase II trial of \ncladribine with rituximab in 29 patients with newly diagnosed or previously \ntreated WM, reported ORRs and CR rates were 90% and 24%, respectively . Cladribine with or without rituximab is listed under Useful in \nCertain Circumstances for Therapy for Previously Treated WM/LPL. \nEverolimus : Everolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR, is a potentially effective \ndrug in treating WM, with high single- agent activity but substantial toxicity.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 \nWaldenström Macroglobulinemia/ \nLymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma  \nMS-13 With a different mechanism of action, it offers an alternate therapeutic \nstrategy for patients with relapsed/refractory WM. A phase II trial of single-\nagent everolimus was initiated in 60 patients with relapsed or \nrelapsed/refractory WM.101 The response rate (minor response or better) \nwas 73% with a PR rate of 50% and a minor response rate of 23%.102 The \nmedian PFS was 21 months. Grade 3- or 4-related toxicities were reported \nin 67% of patients. Dose reductions due to toxicity were made in 62% of patients. The most frequently  reported hematologic toxicities were \ncytopenias. Pulmonary toxicity was seen in 5% of patients.\n102 The study \nreported that partial response to treatment was achieved after a median of \n2 months. Everolimus  is listed in the algorithm under Useful in Certain \nCircumstances  for Therapy for Previously Treated WM/LPL . \nFludarabine Alone or With Rituximab : Like cladribine, fludarabine is a \nnucleoside analogue and has been studied alone or in combination with \nrituximab and/or cyclophosphamide in patients with newly diagnosed WM. \nA phase III trial showed that monotherapy with fludarabine was more effective than chlorambucil in terms of PFS (36.3 vs. 27.1 months; P = \n.012), DOR  (38.3 vs. 19.9 months; P  < .001) , and OS (not reached in the \nfludarabine arm vs. 69.8 months  [95% CI, 61.6– 79.8 months; P = .014 ] in \nthe chlorambucil arm).\n103  \nA prospective, multicenter trial evaluated treatment with fludarabine with \nrituximab  in patients with WM (n = 43) who had received <2  prior \ntherapies, of whom 63% had received no prior therapy. The ORR was \n95%. The reported median time to progression for all patients was 51.2 \nmonths and was longer for untreated patients ( P = .017) and those \nachieving at least a VGPR ( P = .049).  After a median follow -up of 40.3 \nmonths, 3 cases with transformation to aggressive lymphoma and 3 cases \nwith MDS/AML were reported .104 Fludarabine used alone or in combination \nwith rituximab is listed in the algorithm under Useful in Certain Circumstances  for Therapy for Previously Treated WM/LPL . Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide/Rituximab : A retrospective study of \npatients with relapsed/refractory WM reported an ORR of 80% after \ntreatment with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab  (FCR), with \n32.5% (n  = 13) of patients reaching at least a VGPR.105 Another \nmulticenter , prospective trial evaluated the quality of response in 43 \npatients with WM receiving FCR, who were either  previously untreated or \npretreated with chemotherapy.106 Most of the participants  in this study \n(65%) received FCR as first -line treatment, 28% of people  had relapsed \ndisease , and 7% had disease that was refractory to a previous line of \ntreatment.  The results demonstrated that FCR produces rapid response \nrates of 79%, with high rates of CR and VGPR . There is a risk of PJP \nassociated with FCR treatment, including late onset of PJP .107 Therefore, \nthe NCCN P anel recommends PJP prophylaxis for those treated with the \nFCR regimen . \nNucleoside analogs have shown efficacy in relapsed/refractory WM/LPL \neither alone or in combination with rituximab.100,104,106 All cladribine - and \nfludarabine- containing regimens have been listed in the algorithm under \nUseful in Certain Circumstances  for Therapy for Previously Treated \nWM/LP L.  \nPirtobrutinib: Pirtobrutinib, a highly selective, non -covalent BTKi has \ndemonstrated favorable results in relapsed or refractory B -cell \nmalignancies with a poor prognosis, including patients who have previously received covalent BTKis.\n108 The phase I/II BRUIN study \nevaluated the efficacy of pirtobrutinib in individuals with WM who had received prior chemotherapy + anti -CD20 antibody, ≥1 prior BTKi , or \nchemotherapy + anti -CD20 antibody + BTKi. Of the response -evaluable \npatients (n = 72), the major response rate was 68% (95% CI, 56– 79). In \nthose who had received ≥1 prior BTKi , chemotherapy + anti -CD20 \nantibody, and chemotherapy + anti -CD20 antibody + BTKi, the major \nresponse rate s were  64%, 68%, and 64%, respectively.

Two percent of patients discontinued the trial due to treatment -related \nAEs. Pirtobrutinib is listed in the algorithm under Useful in Certain \nCircumstances  for Therapy for Previously Treated WM/LPL . \nRituximab : Treatment with single -agent rituximab has been reported to \nproduce 40% to 50% response rates .68,71,109 The NCCN Panel has \nincluded single -agent rituximab as a treatment option under Useful in \nCertain Circumstances for Previously Treated WM/LPL.  For those \nindividuals who are unable to tolerate rituximab, ofatumumab was previously listed as an option.  \n110 However, since it is no longer available \nfor use in hematologic malignancies, it has been removed as an option.  \nResults from an  open- label, phase 2, single- arm study  suggest that \nobinutuzumab may have clinical activity in WM.111 A total of 23 patients \nwere enrolled in the study with a median age of 66 years and a median of \n1 prior treatment. The median follow -up duration was 20.7 months. The \nORR at the end of induction was 52.2%, with 21.7% achieving a VGPR  or \nbetter. The PFS and OS rates at 18 months were 68% and 90%, respectively. AEs occurred in 95.7% of patients, with the most common \nbeing infections, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Severe AEs \noccurred in 69.6% of patients, and two deaths were reported, one due to \ncardiac i nsufficiency and another related to COVID -19. The NCCN P anel \nconsensus was to add o binutuzumab as an option for consideration in \npatients who are unable to tolerate rituximab.  \nRCHOP :\n RCHOP  is a stem cell –sparing regimen reported to be active and \ntolerated by patients with WM.78,112,113 It has been reported as having a \n≥90% response rate in patients with WM.78,113,114 In a randomized study \ninvolving 69 patients, most of whom had WM, the addition of rituximab to \nCHOP resulted in a higher ORR (94% vs. 67%) and median time to \nprogression (63 vs. 22 months) in comparison to patients treated with \nCHOP alone.113 The addition of vincristine to cyclophosphamide-containing regimens is associated with risk of neuropathy in patients with \nWM.61 According to the NCCN Panel, since vincristine is associated with a \nhigh risk of peripheral neuropathy in patients with WM/LPL, regimens \nwithout vincristine ( eg, cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone/rituximab), may \nbe considered if cyclophosphamide- based therapy is being considered.  \nHematopoietic Cell Transplant   \nHCT is also an option for relapsed WM in selected patients .115-117 HCT \noptions listed in the NCCN Guidelines for WM/LPL are for high- dose \ntherapy with autologous stem cell rescue.115,116 According to the NCCN \nPanel, myeloablative or non- myeloablative allogeneic H CT may be \nconsidered,115 but in the context of a clinical trial.  \nManagement of Bing-Neel Syndrome  \nBing-Neel syndrome (BNS) is a rare manifestation of WM  that results in \nthe migration of LPCs to the central nervous system  (CNS) .118,119 \nNeurologic deficits concerning BNS  include but are not limited to \nheadaches, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, weakness in limbs, and \natypical neuropathy.  Differential diagnosis of BNS includes hyperviscosity \nsyndrome (HVS) with CNS manifestation,  which  can present as  new onset \nof neurologic symptoms  such as headaches,  visual impairment, and nose \nbleeds.120,121 HVS with CNS involvement can be differentiated from BNS \nby confirming an appropriate increase in serum IgM consistent with levels \ndetected in those with WM , in conjunction with abnormal  imaging and/or \nthe presence of clonal B  cells in CSF or  cerebral  tissue.122 Diagnostic \ncriteria and workup of BNS includes histology, CSF analysis, molecular \ntesting, radiology, and blood analysis.120 Neuroimaging is encouraged in \norder to exclude differential diagnosis and aid in the selection of an \nappropriate site for biopsy.120 Two forms of CNS involvement (diffuse and \ntumoral) can be best evaluated after gadolinium administration and MRI.120 \nThe diffuse form is associated with infiltration of lymphoid cells in the PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:11 PM.

This form presents as an \nenhancement or thickening of the meningeal sheath. Conversely, the \ntumoral form can be multifocal or unifocal and is found deep in the \nsubcortical hemisphere.120 CNS lymphoma histology cannot be detected \non an MRI and thus  BNS cannot be excluded in the absence of MRI \nfindings. Diagnostic criteria for BNS include histologic biopsy of the \ncerebrum or meninges positive for  clonal B cells  with morphologic \nevidence of LPL . Analysis of the CSF should include cell count and \ndifferentiation, morphologic analysis, flow cytometry, and molecular testing to increase the sensitivity for detecting the presence of malignant B cells in \nthe CSF. Analysis of CSF should be done routinely and should not \nprecede the MRI to eliminate CSF sampling- induced meningeal \nenhancement.\n120 Ig gene rearrangement assays can also be performed to \ndetermine clonal characteristics of a B -cell population. In addition, \nmutations in MYD88  with an amino acid point mutation L265P have been \ndetected in 93 % to 97% of individuals with WM , using highly sensitive \ndiagnostic techniques such as allele- specific PCR.120 Definitive diagnosis \nof BNS includes presence of clonal B  cells in CSF or within a tissue biopsy \nwith a typical manifestation and presentation of  systemic disease. \nDiagnosis can be confirmed with or without leptomeningeal enhancement \nor masses detected with an MRI. A probable diagnosis is made  with \nabnormal MRI findings without evidence of clonal B cells  in CSF or tissue \nbiopsy.  \nIf a person has abnormal test results but remains  asymptomatic , their \ntreatment will continue with routine observation. If a person is \nsymptomatic , various  systemic therapy options are recommended; \npreferred regimens include BTK is such as ibrutinib123 and zanubrutinib. \nOther recommended regimens include chemotherapy agents such as \nbendamustine, cytarabine, fludarabine, and methotrexate. Regimens \nuseful in certain circumstances include intrathecal methotrexate and \nradiotherapy . If systemic control is needed, rituximab can be added to any of the above regimens.  BNS is a rare and usually a late manifestation in \nthose with WM. It can develop when a person is in remission or less \ntypically at the beginning of disease manifestation.124 When BNS develops \nlater in the disease , it is usually associated with a worse prognosis.120,125 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:13:11 PM.
