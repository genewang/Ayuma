A core needle biopsy is not optimal  but can be used under certain circumstances  because features of CD are very nonspecific and seeing the whole \nnode with architecture is essential to be confident of the diagnosis. Therefore, core needle biopsy is unlikely to be adequate for definitive pathologic diagnosis \nof CD. but can be used under certain circumstances. Core needle biopsy (multiple biopsies preferred) is an appropriate alternative to excisional or incisional \nbiopsy, especially in certain circumstances (when a lymph node is not easily accessible for excisional or incisional biopsy or if surgical biopsy would cause \nsignificant morbidity or substantial treatment delays); a combination of core needle biopsy (multiple biopsies preferred) and FNA  biopsies biopsy in conjunction with \nappropriate ancillary techniques for the differential diagnosis (immunohistochemistry [IHC], flow cytometry , molecular analysis to detect immunoglobulin [Ig] gene \nrearrangements, karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] for major translocationsa) may be sufficient for diagnosis.\n\u00173rd bullet revised: Hematopathology review of all slides with at least one paraffin block representative of the tumor  lesion .

Major  \nCriteria  \n(need both):1. Histopathologic lymph node features consistent with the iMCD spectrum. Features along the iMCD spectrum include (need grade 2–3 for either \nregressive GCs or plasmacytosis at minimum):\n          - Regressed/atrophic/atretic germinal centers, often with expanded mantle zones composed of concentric rings of lymphocytes in an “onion                                                                                          \n             skinning” appearance\n          - FDC prominence\n          - Vascularity, often with prominent endothelium in the interfollicular space and vessels penetrating into the GCs with a “lollipop” appearance\n          - Sheetlike, polytypic plasmacytosis in the interfollicular space\n          - Hyperplastic GCs\n2. Enlarged lymph nodes (≥1 cm in short-axis diameter) in ≥2 lymph node stations\nII. Minor  \nCriteria  \n(need at least \n2 of 11 criteria \nwith at least \n1 laboratory \ncriterion)Laboratory *\n1. Elevated CRP (>10 mg/L) or ESR (>15 mm/h) †\n2. Anemia (hemoglobin <12.5 g/dL for males, hemoglobin <11.5 g/dL \nfor females)\n3. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 µ/mL) or thrombocytosis \n(platelet count >400 µ/mL)\n4. Hypoalbuminemia (albumin <3.5 g/dL)\n5. Renal dysfunction (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2) or proteinuria (total \nprotein 150 mg/24 h or 10 mg/100 mL)\n6. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (total γ globulin or immuno -\nglobulin G >1700 mg/dL)Clinical\n1. Constitutional symptoms: night sweats, fever (>38°C), weight loss, or \nfatigue (≥2 CTCAE lymphoma score for B-symptoms)\n2. Large spleen and/or liver \n3. Fluid accumulation: edema, anasarca, ascites, or pleural effusion\n4. Eruptive cherry hemangiomatosis or violaceous papules\n5. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis\nIII. Exclusion \nCriteria  \n(must rule out \neach of these \ndiseases that \ncan mimic \niMCD)Infection-related disorders\n1. HHV-8 (infection can be documented by blood PCR; diagnosis of   \nHHV-8–associated MCD requires positive LANA-1 staining by IHC, \nwhich excludes iMCD)\n2. Clinical EBV-lymphoproliferative disorders such as infectious  \nmononucleosis or chronic active EBV (detectable EBV viral load not \nnecessarily exclusionary)\n3. Inflammation and adenopathy caused by other uncontrolled \ninfections (eg, acute or uncontrolled CMV, toxoplasmosis, HIV, active \ntuberculosis) Autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases  (requires full clinical criteria; \ndetection of autoimmune antibodies alone is not exclusionary)\n1. Systemic lupus erythematosus\n2. Rheumatoid arthritis\n3. Adult-onset Still disease\n4. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis\n5. Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome\nMalignant/lymphoproliferative disorders  (these disorders must be \ndiagnosed before or at the same time as iMCD to be exclusionary):\n1.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nCastleman Disease   \n \nMS-2 Overview \nCastleman disease (CD) is a relatively uncommon heterogenous group of \nlymphoproliferative disorder s with an annual incidence of approximately  \n3336 to 5282 cases in the U nited States .1 These disorders share common \nhistopathologic features,  and certain subtypes are associated with an \nincreased risk of developing diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL), \nKaposi sarcoma (KS) , and POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, \nendocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, skin changes) \nsyndrome.2-4 \nUnicentric Castleman disease (UCD) and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) are the two main clinical subtypes. In the 2022 newly revised WHO \nclassification of hematolymphoid tumors (WHO5), UCD and MCD are classified as tumour -like lesions with B -cell predominance.\n5 In the 2022 \nInternational Consensus Classification, UCD is not included and MCD is \nclassified as human herpesvirus 8 ( HHV8 )-associated lymphoproliferative \ndisorder.6   \nMCD is further divided into HHV8- positive (also known as KS herpesvirus \n[KSHV] -positive), HHV8 -negative (also known as idiopathic MCD [iMCD]), \nand POEMS -MCD.5 KSHV/HHV8 -positive MCD is most commonly \ndiagnosed in people with HIV  (PWH)  or otherwise immunocompromised \nindividuals  and it has been reported as a  precursor to aggressive B- cell \nlymphomas among PWH .7,8  \niMCD is subclassified into two clinicopathologic subgroups:  1) iMCD-\nTAFRO (defined by thrombocytopenia [T], anasarca [A], fever [F], reticulin \nfibrosis of the bone marrow [R], and organomegaly [O] but generally has \nnormal γ -globulin levels) ; and 2) iMCD- not otherwise specified (NOS), \nwhich is typically characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia and thrombocytosis.\n9,10  The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) \nfor Castleman Disease provide recommendations for the diagnostic \nworkup and treatment for UCD and MCD.  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nThe NCCN Guidelines® strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weigh t-biased; and \ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. \nNCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing \non organ -specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the i nformation is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the initial development of the NCCN Guidelines for Castleman Disease, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to \nobtain key literature in Castleman disease.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nCastleman Disease   \n \nMS-3 chosen because it remains the most widely used resource for medical \nliterature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.11  \nThe search  results were  narrowed by selecting relevant studies in humans \npublished in English. The data from key PubMed articles and articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines and discussed \nby the P anel have been included in this version of the Discussion section \n(eg, e- publications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). Recommendations \nfor which high- level evidence is lacking are based on the P anel’s review of \nlower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nClinical Presentation  \nThe clinical  presentation of CD is often relatively nonspecific with enlarged \nlymph nodes, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms.   \nUCD is characterized by involvement of a single lymph node or lymph \nnode station and usually the absence of systemic symptoms. This subtype \ngenerally has an indolent disease course with an excellent prognosis . \nUCD is most commonly (but not always) the histopathologic hypervascular  \n(hyaline vascular)  variant and is nearly always HIV negative and HHV8  \nnegative.7 While often asymptomatic, some patients may experience  \ncompression symptoms due to  compression of vital organs or  other  \nstructures .12-15 In a series of 404 patients with UCD, the most common \nsites of involvement were the mediastinum (29%), neck (23%), abdomen \n(21%), and retroperitoneum (17%).12 In another analysis of 74 patients (43 \npatients with UCD and 31 patients with iMCD), systemic inflammatory symptoms, elevated inflammatory factors , and abnormal bone marrow \nfeatures were more common in patients with iMCD than UCD.\n13  \nMCD is a remitting -relapsing disease with a variable natural history \nranging from indolent disease with a very slow progression to acute and \nfulminant disease.3,16 HHV8 -positive MCD follows a more aggressive \ncourse. I mmunocompromising conditions is a primary risk factor for HHV8 -positive MCD, with HIV being the most common condition.17 HHV8 -\npositive MCD is more commonly associated with systemic symptoms such \nas fluid accumulation, cytopenias, liver and kidney dysfunction, and constitutional symptoms driven by cytokines such as interleukin 6 ( IL-\n6).\n13,16,18  \niMCD affects multiple lymph node regions and exhibit s lymphadenopathy \nin more than 1 lymph node or lymph node region. Clinical presentation  can \nrange from mild constitutional symptoms  to life -threatening organ failure.  \niMCD- TAFRO generally presents with a more aggressive disease course \nand is associated with poorer outcomes than  iMCD- NOS . The  evaluation \nand determination of treatment should be similar to iMCD -NOS .9,10  \nDiagnosis \nDue to the nonspecific and heterogenous nature of the disease, CD can \noften mimic other benign and malignant conditions.2-4 Therefore, a high \nindex of suspicion and histopathologic analysis is required for diagnosis of CD. Excisional or incisional biopsy of the lymph node (preferably the most \nfluorodeoxyglucose [FDG ]-avid, accessible lymph node) is preferred for \nthe definitive diagnosis of CD.\n19-22 \nA combination of clinical, imaging, and pathologic features should be used to establish the diagnosis of UCD, HHV8- positive MCD, and iMCD.\n19,21 In \nan asymptomatic patient , histopathology consistent with CD along with the \ninvolvement of a  single lymph node or region of lymph nodes  can establish \na diagnosis of UCD .21,22  \nHistopathologically, CD has been divided into hypervascular (also called \nhyaline vascular), plasmacytic, and mixed histologic subtypes.23 The \nhypervascular variant is most commonly associated with UCD, whereas \nthe plasmacytic and mixed variants are more common in HHV8-\nassociated MCD. iMCD- NOS may exhibit any of the three histologic \npatterns, whereas i MCD- TAFRO is most commonly either hypervascular \nor mixed.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nCastleman Disease   \n \nMS-4 The 2017 international diagnostic consensus criteria for the diagnosis of \niMCD include two major criteria : histopathologic lymph node features \nconsistent with the iMCD spectrum and enlarged lymph node s in ≥2 lymph \nnode stations ; and 11 minor criteria :19 anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nhypoalbuminemia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, renal dysfunction \n(elevated glomerular filtration rate [GFR ] or proteinuria) , elevated \nerythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein ( CRP ), \nconstitutional symptoms, enlarged spleen and/or liver, fluid accumulation, \neruptive cherry hemangiomatosis or violaceous papules, and lymphocytic \ninterstitial pneumonitis.  \nThe diagnosis of iMCD requires the presence of both major criteria, at \nleast 2 of 11 minor criteria with at least 1 laboratory abnormality, and \nexclusion of infectious, malignant, and autoimmune disorders that can \nmimic iMCD.19 See Consensus Diagnostic Criteria for Idiopathic MCD in \nthe algorithm . \nAdequate immunophenotyping of a surgically excised lymph node is \nrequired to confirm the diagnosis and exclude malignancy and other \ndiseases.19 The recommended immunohistochemistry ( IHC) panel \nessential for diagnosis includes: CD20, CD3, CD5, CD138, HHV8  latency -\nassociated nuclear antigen (LANA) , kappa, and lambda. Additional IHC \nmarkers may be useful under certain circumstances: Ki -67 index, \nimmunoglobulin ( Ig) heavy chains, CD10, BCL2, BCL6, cyclin D1, CD21, \nCD23, CD38, IRF4/MUM1, and PAX5. Epstein- Barr virus -encoded RNA in \nsitu hybridization (EBER -ISH) and flow cytometry with peripheral blood \nand/or biopsy specimen of kappa/lambda, CD19, CD20, CD5, CD23, and CD10 may also be useful in certain circumstances. Other diagnostic \ntesting that may be useful under certain circumstances includes molecular \nanalysis to detect Ig gene rearrangements.  Workup  \nInitial workup should include a physical examination (with attention given \nto node -bearing areas, liver, and spleen) and evaluation of performance \nstatus . Laboratory assessments should include standard blood work \nincluding complete blood count (CBC) with differential, and a \ncomprehensive metabolic panel. Serum  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) , \nCRP, and ESR should be measured. Serum protein electrophoresis should be evaluated if there is concern for POEMS syndrome. Pregnancy \ntesting should be done in patients of childbearing potential if \nchemotherapy or radiation therapy ( RT) is planned.  PET/CT scan  \n(preferred) or a chest/abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast of diagnostic \nquality are recommended as part of an initial diagnostic workup to confirm extent of disease and total nodal involvement.\n20,22  \nTesting to detect the presence of HIV, HHV8 , and Epstein- Barr virus \n(EBV)  polymerase chain reaction ( PCR)  should also be done as part of \nroutine workup. HHV8 -positive MCD is distinguished by positive testing for \nHHV8 in lymph node tissue as well as PCR positivity for HHV8 in plasma \nin addition to multiple affected lymph nodes and histopathology consistent \nwith CD.16 Screening for concurrent KS is recommended in the setting of \nHHV8 or HIV positivity  since HHV8 -positive MCD may occur with \nconcomitant KS in ≤ 72% of patients .24 Hepatitis B testing ( if rituximab -\ncontaining regimens are being considered due to  the risk of viral \nreactivation anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody [mAb]-based regimens) and \nhepatitis C testing are also essential components of workup .  \nBone marrow biopsy and aspirate as well as reticulin fibrosis of bone \nmarrow  (particularly in patients with TAFRO syndrome ) may be useful \nunder certain circumstances.25 An echocardiogram or multigated \nacquisition ( MUGA ) scan can be considered if anthracycline- based \nregimens  are being considered for treatment. Other components of \nworkup that may be useful in certain circumstances include neck CT with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:31:10 PM.

Careful \nconsideration should be given to the risks and benefits of any therapy for \npatients with UCD, and observation can be considered in asymptomatic \npatients.21  \nFirst -Line Therapy  \nSurgical  resection is the optimal treatment, wherever possible, as it has \nbeen associated with very low rates of recurrence and high relapse- free \nsurvival  (RFS)  in multiple case series and retrospective studies .2,12,15,21,26- 28  \nOne case series of 53 patients reported a 5 -year overall survival (OS) rate \nof 91% ,2 and another retrospective analysis of 278 patients showed an OS \nrate of >90% with up to 10- year follow up.12 Therefore , all patients with a \ndiagnosis of UCD should be evaluated for resectability  of disease.21  \nObservation until recurrence is recommended following complete resection. Patients who are asymptomatic following an incomplete \nresection may be observed until recurrence. Patients  who remain \nsymptomatic following incomplete resection should be treated as \ndescribed below for unresectable disease .  \nObservation is also appropriate for asymptomatic patients with \nunresectable UCD. Available evidence (mostly from case reports) \nsupports the use of RT or rituximab with or without steroids in patients with \nsymptomatic unresectable UCD.\n21,29,30 RT should be reserved for severe \nsymptomatic and unresectable disease due to potential long- term \ncomplications.21 The optimal dose of RT in unresectable UCD is not \nestablished. Doses as high as 40 Gy in 1.5 to 2 Gy fractions have been \nused.29 Lower doses may be considered depending upon clinical circumstances and advanced radiation techniques are recommended to \nlimit the radiation dose to surrounding normal tissues.31  \nInvolved- site RT (ISRT) or systemic therapy (rituximab ± prednisone ± \ncyclophosphamide)  with the intent of eventual surgical resection  are \nincluded as options for patients with unresectable disease.21,29,30 Patients \nwith non- bulky disease may be observed after ISRT. Embolization may \nalso be considered in certain situations to render surgical resection more \nfeasible and reduce the risk of severe perioperative bleeding.21 \nRelapsed/Refractory Disease  \nBiopsy is encouraged in patients with relapsed/refractory disease to rule \nout transformation to DLBCL or concomitant development of other \nmalignancies or opportunistic infections.  \nTreatment options for relapsed/refractory disease are the same as described above for unresectable disease : ISRT , embolization (if \namenable),  or systemic therapy with the intent of eventual surgical \nresection ( rituximab ± prednisone ± cyclophosphamide) .\n21   \nPatients with inflammatory symptoms ( eg, night sweats, fevers, weight \nloss) or laboratory disturbances (increased ESR or CRP) may have \nexcessive cytokine production and may benefit from anti -IL-6 monoclonal \nantibodies (anit -IL-6 mAbs ) such as siltuximab and tocilizumab, although \nevidence in this setting is sparse.21 Siltuximab  or tocilizumab is included \nas an option for relapsed/refractory disease that is  HIV-negative and \nHHV8 -negative.   \nMulticentric Castleman Disease     \nTreatment recommendations for MCD are based on the presence of \ncriteria for active disease, fulminant /severe  disease,  or organ failure and \nHHV8  status. Patients may experience symptoms related to an excess of \nIL-6 production;  establishing the severity of symptoms is a vital component \nof management , as severity can vary widely between patients.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nCastleman Disease   \n \nMS-6 Corticosteroid monotherapy is not very effective for disease control  but \nmay be combined with other therapies for symptom control.  Due to the \nrarity of the condition, available evidence for most of the treatment options \nis based on case reports making comparison between treatment options \ndifficult.20,32,33  \nPatients with POEMS -associated MCD should have treatment directed at \nPOEMS syndrome with regimens recommended for the treatment of \nmultiple myeloma . High -dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell \nrescue (HDT/ASCR) may also result in favorable outcomes, particularly for \npatients with MCD associated with POEMS.34,35 \nFirst -Line Therapy  \nCriteria for Active Disease Present With No Organ Failure  \nIn patients with criteria for active MCD (fever, increased serum CRP  level \n>20 mg/L in the absence of any other etiology, and at least three other MCD- related symptoms ) with no organ failure, first-line therapy  options are \nbased on HHV8  status as described below.  \nIdiopathic MCD  (non-severe; HIV-1 and HHV8 negative)  \nRituximab - and cyclophosphamide- containing regimens have \ndemonstrated activity in patients with iMCD.\n36-38 A systematic review of 47 \npatients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, with or without rituximab, \nreported a complete response (CR)  rate of 44% with 93% of patients alive \nat 2 years.36  In a retrospective study of 27 patients with iMCD, rituximab - \nand cyclophosphamide- containing regimens resulted in an overall \nresponse rate (ORR)  of 56% with a CR rate of 33% .37 In a single- arm, \nphase 2 study of 25 patients with newly diagnosed iMCD treated with the \nTCP regimen, primary endpoint (durable tumor and symptomatic response \nfor at least 24 weeks) was achieved in 48% of patients; 12% of patients \nhad stable disease and t he estimated 1- year PFS and OS rates were 60% \nand 88%, respectively.38  Siltuximab is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with iMCD that is \nHIV-1 and HHV8 negative based on the results of  a double- blind , placebo-\ncontrolled,  international trial .39-41 In this trial 79 patients with iMCD were \nrandomized to siltuximab (n  = 53) or placebo (n = 26). Siltuximab resulted \nin significantly improved durable tumor  and symptomatic response  rate \ncompared to placebo (34% vs. 0%; P  = .0012).39 Long- term follow- up data , \nafter a median follow -up of 6 years , also established the efficacy and \nsafety of siltuximab.40 Siltuximab was also associated with significantly \nimproved progression- free survival (PFS) compared to placebo (median \nPFS was not reached for siltuximab compared to 15 months for placebo; P \n= .0001).41 Adverse events of grade ≥3 were reported in 60% of patients , \nwith hypertension (13%), fatigue (8%), nausea (7%), neutropenia (7%), and vomiting (5%) being the most common adverse events.  \nIt is worth noting that in this pivotal trial responses were predominant in patients with the plasmacytic or mixed histologic variants and were not \nseen in the hyaline vascular variant where siltuximab may have less \nclinical activity.\n39 However, secondary analyses of clinical trial and real -\nworld data demonstrated that siltuximab resulted in similar clinical benefit \nacross histopathologic subtypes, confirming the efficacy of siltuximab in \nthe hyaline vascular variant  also.42 Importantly, in the aforementioned \nclinical trial, placebo was used as the control arm instead of an active \ntreatment regimen , so it is unknown whether siltuximab is superior to \nchemoimmunotherapy.  Therefore, chemoimmunotherapy  can be \nconsidered as an appropriate treatment option in selected patients, \nparticularly for patients with fulminant /severe  disease.36  \nRituximab (with or without prednisone), RCVP (rituximab, \ncyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone), siltuximab,  or TCP \n(thalidomide, cyclophosphamide,  and prednisone) are included as options \nfor first- line therapy. Patients with disease responding to rituximab -based \nregimens should be observed until disease progression requiring retreatment.

Twenty -two of the 24 patients \nwere able to become independent of chemotherapy, and more than three \nquarters remained free from symptoms and progression 2 years after \ntreatment.43 In another  phase II study  of 21 patients with plasmablastic  \nMCD,  20 patients achieved remission of symptoms, and 14 (67%) \nachieved a radiologic response. The median follow -up was 12 months. \nThe OS and disease -free survival  (DFS)  rates at 2 years were 95% and \n79%, respectively. The main adverse effect was reactivation of KS.44 In \nanother retrospective analysis of 113 patients  (48 had previously received \nrituximab and 60 were previously diagnosed with KS ), treatment with \nrituximab was associated with a higher 5 -year OS rate compared to \ntreatment with chemotherapy alone (90% vs. 47%) .45  \nOccult KS is prevalent in HIV -1/HHV8 -positive  MCD and may flare after \ntreatment with rituximab or prednisone.45 The use of rituximab in \ncombination with liposomal doxorubicin may reduce the incidence of KS exacerbation and may be particularly useful for patients with HHV8-positive MCD with concurrent KS.\n46,47  \nZidovudine with valganciclovir has also been shown to be active in HHV8-\npositive MCD.47,48 In a study that included 20 patients with HHV8- MCD \nalone and 34 patients with HHV8- MCD and KS, the 5- year PFS rate was \n26% for treatment with the combination of zidovudine and valganciclovir.47 \nThe median PFS was 6 months. In a pilot study of 14 patients with HHV8-positive MCD, high -dose zidovudine in combination with valganciclovir \nresulted in major clinical and biochemical responses being attained in 86% \nand 50% of patients, respectively.\n48  \nRituximab + prednisone, rituximab + liposomal doxorubicin (with or without \nprednisone) , and zidovudine with either ganciclovir or valganciclovir are \nalso included as options for first -line therapy.  \nFulminant or Severe MCD With or Without Organ Failure   \nCombination chemotherapy regimens (CHOP  [cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone] , CVAD  [cyclophosphamide, \nvincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone] , and CVP  \n[cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone] ) with rituximab  or liposomal \ndoxorubicin with rituximab (with or without prednisone) are included as  \noptions for first -line therapy  for HHV8 -positive MCD . Combination \nchemotherapy may result in durable remissions.20,29,32,33,49 Liposomal \ndoxorubicin or rituximab monotherapy are appropriate treatment  options \nfor patients who are not candidates for combination chemotherapy.43,44,46 \nSiltuximab or combination chemotherapy (CHOP, CVAD, and CVP) with or \nwithout rituximab are included as options for first -line therapy for HHV8 -\nnegative iMCD .20,29,32,33,49 Tocilizumab is an appropriate option, if there is a \nshortage of siltuximab or if it is not available.

Etoposide ( PO or IV) , vinblastine, liposomal doxorubicin (for \nHHV8 -positive disease) , siltuximab  (for HHV8 -negative disease) , or \nsirolimus  are included as options for single- agent therapy. CHOP, CVAD, \nand CVP are the chemotherapy options recommended for second- line \ntherapy.20,32,33 Liposomal doxorubicin +/ - rituximab is included as an option \nfor HHV8 -positive disease with organ failure. Observation or maintenance \nwith valganciclovir may be considered for HHV8 -positive  disease \nresponding to treatment.  \nA prespecified analysis of the patients enrolled in the pivotal trial also \nshowed that siltuximab is equally effective in patients with newly \ndiagnosed as well as those with previously treated MCD (29 patients with \npreviously treated iMCD in the siltuximab group and 17 patients in the \nplacebo gr oup). Siltuximab is included as an option for second -line therapy \nin patients with HHV8 -negative disease.50 Patients who received \nchemoimmunotherapy as initial treatment may receive siltuximab if \nneeded subsequently for relapsed/refractory disease.  Tocilizumab is an \nappropriate option, if there is a shortage of siltuximab or if it is not available.  \nThe results of the retrospective study (n = 26 patients) showed that the \nmTOR inhibitor sirolimus was a well- tolerated and effective treatment for \npatients with relapsed/refractory iMCD.\n51 After a median follow -up of 12 \nmonths, sirolimus resulted in a response rate of 69% (biologic and symptomatic response) and the median time to next treatment was 46 \nmonths. Sirolimus is included as a single- agent therapy option for second -\nline therapy  in patients with HHV8 -negative disease.  \nAlternative single -agent or combination therapy should be considered  for \ndisease progression following the aforementioned second- line treatment \noptions for relapsed/refractory disease. Tocilizumab is an effective \ntreatment option for patients with MCD that is refractory to rituximab and \nchemoimmunotherapy.34,52- 54 Other options include bortezomib +/ - \nrituximab, thalidomide +/ - rituximab, lenalidomide +/ - rituximab, high- dose \nzidovudine + valganciclovir, and anakinra (IL- 1 receptor antagonist), \nbased on case reports and case series.20,47,48,55- 60  \n  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:31:10 PM.
