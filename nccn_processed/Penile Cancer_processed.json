Mohs micrographic surgery for penile cancer: management and long-term followup. J Urol 2007;178:1980-1985.Wide Local Excision  \n• This is designated for early-stage penile cancer confined to the skin with little or no invasion (clinical stage PeIN, Ta, T1).\n• The surgical margins for wide local excision depend on the location of the penile tumor.\n\u0017Penile tumors of the shaft may be treated with wide local excision, with or without circumcision.\n\u0017Circumcision alone may be reasonable for tumors of the distal prepuce.\n• Complete excision of the skin with a wide negative margin is needed and may require the use of a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) or full-\nthickness skin graft (FTSG) (if a primary tension-free reapproximation cannot be completed). \n• If positive surgical margins, re-resection may be considered.\n• Glans resurfacing may be considered in highly select patients.\nGlansectomy\n• Glansectomy may be considered for select patients with distal tumors (clinical stage PeIN, Ta, T1) on the glans or prepuce.\n\u0017For patients with PeIN or Ta disease, a complete glansectomy is a category 2B recommendation.\n\u0017For patients with T1 G1–2 disease, glansectomy is not recommended unless required to ensure complete tumor eradication with negative \nmargins.\n• Negative surgical margins should be determined from frozen sections of the cavernosal bed and urethral stump.\n• Treatment is followed in certain instances with an STSG or FTSG to create a neoglans.\nMohs Micrographic Surgery (category 2B)\n• Mohs surgery is an alternative to wide local excision in select cases.2\n\u0017Thin layers of cancerous skin are excised and viewed microscopically until a tissue layer is negative for the tumor.\n\u0017Mohs surgery allows for increased precision, although the success rate declines with higher stage disease.\n• This may be preferable for a small superficial lesion on the proximal shaft to avoid total penectomy for an otherwise fairly low-risk lesion.PRINCIPLES OF PENILE ORGAN-SPARING APPROACHESPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:40 PM.

If a partial penectomy is not possible, a total penectomy should be performed.\n• Partial or total penectomy is necessary when there is invasion into the corpora cavernosum in order to achieve a negative margin.\n• Intraoperative frozen sections are recommended to determine negative margins.\nSurgical Management of Inguinal and Pelvic Lymph Nodes\n• Standard or modified ILND or DSNB is indicated in patients with penile cancer in the absence of palpable inguinal adenopathy if high-risk \nfeatures for nodal metastasis are seen in the primary penile tumor: \n\u0017Lymphovascular invasion\n\u0017≥pT1G3 or ≥T2, any grade\n\u0017>50% poorly differentiated \n• DSNB is only recommended if the treating physician has experience with this modality.\n• If positive lymph nodes are found on DSNB, ILND is recommended.\n• PLND should be considered at the time or following ILND in patients with ≥2 positive inguinal nodes on the ipsilateral ILND site or in the \npresence of extranodal extension on final pathologic review.\n• A bilateral PLND should be considered either at the time or following ILND in patients with ≥4 positive inguinal nodes (in total among both \nsides).1\n• See Discussion for further details regarding ILND and PLND.\n1 Zargar-Shoshtari K, Djajadiningrat R, Sharma P, et al.

Stable or responding disease should then undergo consolidative \nsurgery with curative intent. The phase II response rate was 50% in the neoadjuvant setting. The estimated rate of long-term progression-\nfree survival for intent to treat was 36.7%.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPenile Cancer   \n \nMS-2 \nOverview \nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the penis is a rare disease, \nrepresenting 0.4% to 0.6% of all malignant neoplasms among males  in \nthe United States and Europe.1 In 2024 , the estimated number of new \ncases of penile and other male genital cancers in the United States is  \n2100, with 500 predicted cancer -specific deaths.2 The i ncidence is \nhigher in the developing countries of Asia, Africa, and South America.3 \nThe most common age at  presentation is between 50 and 70 years.4 \nEarly diagnosis is of utmost importance, as this is a disease that can \nresult in devastating disfigurement and has a 5 -year survival rate of \napproximately 50% ( >85% for patients with negative lymph nodes and \n29%–40% for patients with positive nodes, with the lowest survival rates \nat 0% for patients with pelvic lymph node [PLN] involvement).5 As the \nrarity of this disease makes it difficult to perform prospective, \nrandomized trials, the NCCN Panel relied on the experience of penile \ncancer experts and the best currently available evidence- based data to \ncollectively lay a foundation to help standardize the management of this \nmalignancy.  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at www.NCCN.org\n. \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice \nGuidelines (NCCN Guidelines®) for Penile Cancer, an electronic search \nof the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature  \npublished since the previous Guidelines update, using the search term: \npenile cancer . The PubMed database was chosen because it remains \nthe most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature.\n6  The search  results were  narrowed by selecting studies in humans \npublished in English. Results were confined to the following article \ntypes: Clinical Trial; Guideline; Meta- Analysis; Randomized Controlled \nTrial; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as \nrelevant to these guidelines as discussed by the P anel during the \nGuidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high -level evidence is lacking are \nbased on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.7 NCCN Guidelines endeavor  to \nuse language that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -\nclassist, anti -misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -\nbiased ; and inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and \ngender identities.  NCCN Guidelines  incorporate non -gendered \nlanguage, instead focusing on organ -specific recommendations. This \nlanguage is both more accurate and more inclusive and can help fully \naddress the needs of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender \nidentities. NCCN Guideli nes will continue to use the term s men, \nwomen , female, and male  when citing statistics, recommendations, or \ndata from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. \nMost studies do not report how sex and gender data are collected and \nuse these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not \ndifferentiate gender  from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the \ninformation is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific \ndata in future studies and organi zations to use more inclusive and \naccurate language in their future analyses.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPenile Cancer   \n \nMS-3 \nRisk Factors \nIn the United States the median age at diagnosis is 68 years, with an \nincrease in risk for individuals  >50 years.8 Early detection is assisted by \nthe ability to perform  a good physical exam ination . Phimosis may hinder \nthe capability to properly inspect the areas of highest incidence— the \nglans, inner preputial layer, coronal sulcus, and shaft. Patients  with \nphimosis carry an increased risk for penile cancer of 25% to 60%.4,9,10 A \nreview of penile SCC in the United States showed that 34.5% of \npatients had the primary lesion on the glans, 13.2% on the prepuce, \nand 5.3% on the shaft, with 4.5% overlapping and 42.5% unspecified.8 \nOther risk factors include balanitis, chronic inflammation, penile trauma, lack of neonatal circumcision, tobacco use, lichen sclerosus, poor \nhygiene, and a history of sexually transmitted disease(s), especially \nhuman immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) and human papillomavirus \n(HPV).\n4 Overall, approximately  45% to 80% of penile cancers are \nrelated to HPV, with a strong correlation with types 16, 6, and 18.4,9,11 -13 \nWhile HPV infection is a risk factor for penile cancer, HPV - or p16 -\npositivity have also been reported as  favorable prognostic factors,  in \nterms of better disease- specific survival  (DSS) .14-16 There is an \nincreased risk of HPV infection and associated disease for patients with \nHIV. One study reported that females who are HIV -positive have  a \nhigher risk of HPV acquisition (relative risk, 2.64; 95% CI, 2.04– 3.42) \nand lower HPV clearance ( hazard ratio [ HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62– 0.84) \ncompared to those who are HIV -negative.17 Oral HPV is also reportedly \ncommon in males who are HIV -positive (17.6%; 95% CI , 13.5–22.8%).18  \nNeonatal circumcision is associated with a lower rate of penile cancer, although the protective effect is not seen in adults who have the \nforeskin removed. This reduced incidence of penile cancer in patients \nwho have been circumcised in infancy may reflect other known risk \nfactors including the elimination of phimosis and lower incidence and \nduration of HPV infections in this population (reviewed by Morris et al\n19). However , due to the rarity of the disease, the number of neonatal \ncircumcisions that would need to be performed  to prevent one case of \npenile cancer is relatively high.  A small study suggests that the benefits \nof circumcision may reduce invasive penile cancer but not carcinoma in situ (CIS, also called TIS , or penile intraepithelial neoplasia [ PeIN]).\n20 \nPeople who smoke c igarettes  are noted to be 3 to 4.5 times more likely \nto develop penile cancer.11,21 Patients with lichen sclerosus have a 2% \nto 9% risk of developing penile carcinoma.22-24 Patients with p soriasis \nundergoing psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) treatment have an \nincreased penile cancer incidence of 286 times compared to the general \npopulation. Therefore, they should be shielded during treatment and \nany penile lesion should be closely monitored.25 A study of patients  with \nadvanced penile SCC receiving systemic therapy identified visceral \nmetastases and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) \nperformance score ≥1 as poor prognostic factors for both overall \nsurvival (OS) and progression- free survival  (PFS) .26 However, studies \nremain limited on predictive factors of prognosis in this patient population.  \nClinical Presentation \nMost often penile SCC presents as a palpable, visible lesion on the \npenis, which may be associated with penile pain, discharge, bleeding, \nor a foul odor if the patient delays seeking medical treatment. The lesion \nmay be characterized as nodular, ulcerative, or fungating, and may be \nobscured by phimosis. The patient may exhibit signs of more advanced \ndisease, including palpable nodes and/or constitutional symptoms (eg, \nfatigue, weight loss).  \nCharacterization and Clinical Staging \nApproximately 95% of penile cancers originate in squamous epithelial cells and are further categorized as either SCC or PeIN .\n27 PeIN is a \npremalignant condition at high risk of developing into SCC of the penis PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:40 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPenile Cancer   \n \nMS-4 \nand includes the clinical entities of bowenoid papulosis, erythroplasia of \nQueyrat, and Bowen’s disease.27 The AJCC recognizes four subtypes \nof SCC: verrucous, papillary squamous, warty, and basaloid.28 The \nverrucous subtype is considered to demonstrate low malignant \npotential, while other variants reported—adenosquamous and \nsarcomatoid variants —carry a worse prognosis.29,30 The primary lesion \nis further characterized by its growth pattern with superficial spread, \nnodular or vertical -phase growth, and verrucous pattern.  For more \ninformation, see Principles of Pathology  in the algorithm.  In addition to \nthe penile lesion, evaluation of lymph nodes is also critical, as \ninvolvement of the inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs), the number and site of \npositive nodes, and extracapsular nodal involvement provide the \nstrongest prognostic factors of survival.5,31  \nThe AJCC TNM (tumor, node, and metastasis) Staging System for \npenile carcinoma has been used for staging, with the most recent \nupdate (eighth edition) published in 2017. It was initially introduced in \n1968 and was subsequently revised in 1978, 1987, 2002, and 2010.32-36 \nIn 2010, the AJCC made the distinction between clinical and pathologic \nstaging while eliminating the difference between superficial and deep \ninguinal metastatic nodes.32 The eighth edition of the AJCC staging \nsystem28 includes changes to the primary tumor (T) definitions, \nincluding: 1) broadening the Ta definition to include noninvasive \nlocalized squamous carcinoma; 2) describing T1 by the location of the \ntumor on the penis (eg, glans, foreskin, shaft) and defining inv asion for \neach location; 3) adding perineural invasion as a prognostic indicator to \ndefine T1b from T1a; 4) including corpus spongiosum invasion within \nthe T2 definition; and 5) including corpora cavernosum invasion within \nthe T3 definition. In addition, t he eighth edition includes changes to the \nregional lymph node definitions, the most notable being pN1 defined as ≤2 unilateral inguinal metastases without extranodal extension and pN2 \nbeing defined as ≥ 3 unilateral inguinal metastases or bilateral metastases. Finally, stage II disease has been split into stage IIA and \nstage IIB with T1b or T2, N0, M0 defining stage IIA and T3, N0, M0 \ndefining stage IIB\n28 (see Staging in the algorithm).  \nThe AJCC recommends a grading system for SCC of the penis based on the 3- tiered World Health Organization ( WHO )/International Society \nof Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading system with the following definitions: grade 1, well differentiated; grade 2, moderately \ndifferentiated; and grade 3, poorly differentiated/undifferentiated. Any \nproportion of anaplastic cells c ategorizes the tumor as grade 3.\n28 The \noverall degree of cellular differentiation with high- risk, poorly \ndifferentiated tumors is an important predictive factor for metastatic \nnodal involvement.37 The AJCC also recommends collection of \nsite-specific factors, including: the percentage of tumor that is poorly \ndifferentiated, the depth of invasion in verrucous carcinoma, the \npresence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion, the size of the \nlargest ly mph node metastasis, and the total number of lymph nodes \nremoved.28 \nManagement of Primary Lesions  \nDiagnosis  \nEvaluation of the primary lesion, regional lymph nodes, and distant \nmetastasis will dictate the appropriate and adequate management of \nSCC of the penis, beginning with the first evaluation at presentation and \nthen throughout follow -up. Vital to the initial  management is a good \nphysical exam ination  of the penile lesion(s) that remarks on the \ndiameter of the lesion(s) or suspicious areas; location(s) on the penis; \nnumber of lesions; morphology of the lesion(s); whether the lesion(s) \nare papillary, nodular, ul cerous, or flat; and the relationship with other \nstructures including submucosal, urethra, corpora spongiosa, and/or corpora cavernosa.

For the evaluation of lymph nodes, see \nManagement of Regional Lymph Nodes  below . \nPenile Organ -Sparing Approaches  \nPeIN , Ta, and T1 penile cancer lesions may be amenable to \nconservative penile organ- sparing approaches, including topical \ntherapy, laser therapy, wide local excision, glansectomy, and Mohs \nsurgery. An analysis of the National Cancer Data base reported that OS \nrates were comparable for patients with pT1– T2 penile cancer that was \ntreated with organ -sparing surgery compared to partial or total \npenectomy.42 A multivariable model for predictors of patient survival in \nthis study found that organ- sparing surgery did not predict poor patient \nsurvival (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.64– 1.21). A systematic review of 88 \nstudies including 9578 patients with penile cancer yielded a similar \nconclusion, noting that both penile- sparing and amputative approaches \nare effective treatment options for penile cancer, with amputative \nsurgery having a more negative impact on sexual function and quality of \nlife.43 However, this review also noted a higher 5 -year recurrence- free survival rate for amputative surgery (93.3%) compared to penile- sparing \nsurgery (76.6%) as reported from retrospective comparative studies , \nlikely due to a higher risk of local recurrence with penile- sparing \napproaches . Careful consideration should be given to penile- preserving \ntechniques if the patient is willing and able to undergo close follow- up. \nTopical Therapy  \nTopical therapy is a valuable outpatient treatment due to ease of \nadministration; however, patients should be monitored for adherence to \ntherapy and for toxicity or adverse events ( AEs). Local skin and \napplication site reactions may occur and are generally mild to moderate, although severe reactions may occur with a higher frequency of \napplication. Modification of the application frequency can resolve these complications. Despite significant response rates, the probability of \nrelapse is higher following topical therapy than with other more \naggressive therapies. Therefore, patients who are eligible for topical \ntherapy should be routinely monitored for recurrence.  \nWhile topical therapy for the treatment of P eIN has been reported in \nnumerous case studies and case reports, the data are limited by the \nsmall sample sizes and variation in treatment protocols. A retrospective \nreview from a prospective database of patients diagnosed with P eIN \nover a 10- year range identified patients who received either \n5-fluorouracil (5 -FU) as first -line therapy or imiquimod as the \nsecond- line topical agent.\n44 Topical chemotherapy was given to 45 \npatients with a mean follow -up of 34 months. Therapy was standardized \nto 12 hours every 48 hours for 28 days. A complete response (CR) was reported in 25 patients (57%), while a partial response was seen in 6 \npatients (13.6%); no response was observed in the remaining 13 \npatients (29.5%).

Another \nobservational study of penile PeIN  treated with topical 5- FU or \nimiquimod reported similar results, with CR in 65% of patients, partial response in 25%, and no response in 10%.\n49 Grade 1– 2 AEs were \nreported in 50% of patients and only 65% completed the full course of treatment. Discontinuation of treatment was associated with a \ndiminished CR rate of 28.6%, highlighting the importance of monitoring \npatients for acute toxicity so it may be promptly addressed.  \nImiquimod has been investigated as a second -line therapy for P eIN. \nDue to its ability to produce significant inflammation, initiation of \nimiquimod therapy at a lower frequency (eg, 2 times per week) may be \nbeneficial to evaluate for toxicity or AEs  before increasing the frequency \nof application. Early studies suggested a 100% response to imiquimod (n = 47; 70% CR) ,\n50 although a subsequent review identified a lower \nresponse to therapy with 63% of patients showing a CR and 29% of patients showing no response.\n51 The study highlighted that the \ndifference in response may be related to the frequency and duration of application as well as the P eIN subtype. In this study, bowenoid \npapulosis and Bowen’s disease subtypes responded better to imiquimod than the erythroplasia of Queyrat subtype. Longer, less \nfrequent application (ie, < 4 times per week for an average of 113 days) \nwas demonstrated to have a better response than a shorter, more frequent application (ie, ≥ 4 times per week for an average of 53 days) \n(81% vs. 68% , respectively).  Laser Therapy  \nLaser therapy in select patients with PeIN , Ta, or T1 G1– 2 penile \ncancer has reported acceptable outcomes (see Principles of Penile \nOrgan -Sparing Approaches in the algorithm). Four types of therapeutic \nlasers have been used and include carbon dioxide (CO 2), Nd:YAG, \nargon, and potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) lasers. Nd:YAG and CO 2  \nlasers are the most commonly used, al though KTP laser may also be \nconsidered. Nd:YAG lasers have the deepest penetration capability of 3 \nto 4 mm compared with the CO 2 laser that penetrates to a depth of 0.1 \nmm and KTP lasers that penetrate to 1 to 2 mm.   \nRetrospective studies of laser therapy reported local recurrence rates of \napproximately  18%, comparable to that of surgery, with good cosmetic \nand functional results.52,53 Peniscopically controlled laser excision of \nPeIN  or T1 penile carcinoma in 224 patients compared outcomes based \non primary treatment with excisional surgery for PeIN  or initially invasive \nflat tumors.52 Reductive chemotherapy was given prior to surgery for \nexophytic lesions to broaden the indication of laser excision. Complete \nexcision with adequate lateral margins was achieved in 221 patients \nand with adequate deep margins in 217 patients. The 10- year \nrecurrence rate was 17.5% (95% CI, 16.4% –18.6%), and the 10- year \namputation rate was 5.5% (range, 5.2% –5.7%).52 In a subsequent study \nfrom this group, 56 patients with pT1 disease were treated with CO 2 \nlaser therapy. There were 53 patients alive and disease free at a \nmedian follow -up of 66 months.54 The 3 deaths in the study were the \nresult of unrelated and intercurrent disease. Among the 53 patients \nevaluated at follow -up, 13 had local recurrence and 2 had positive ILNs. \nThe local recurrence correlated to positive margins.54 Another study \nevaluated Nd:YAG laser treatment of patients with T1, T2,  or PeIN  \ndisease. Local recurrence was reported in 48% of patients, with \nrecurrence elsewhere in the glans penis occurring in 20% of cases.55 \nThere were 10 cases of nodal metastases, of which 8  were in patients PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:40 PM.

A systematic review of studies using \nlaser and light therapies for erythroplasia of Queyrat reported complete \nremission in 81.4%, 62.5%, and 58.3% of patients treated with CO 2 \nlaser, methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy, or aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy, respectively.\n56 Another systematic review \nreported response rates between 52%  and 100% for treatment of P eIN \nwith laser therapies, although 7% to 48% showed recurrence and 50% \nhad changes in penile sensitivity.48 \nGlansectomy \nGlansectomy, removal of the glans penis, may be considered for \npatients with distal tumors (clinical stage PeIN, Ta, T1) on the glans or \nprepuce. Negative surgical margins should be determined from frozen \nsections of the cavernosal bed and urethral stump. Treatment in certain \ninstances may include a split - or full -thickness skin graft.  \nA retrospective study of 177 patients with SCC of the glans who \nreceived glansectomy and split -thickness skin graft had a 9.3% \nincidence of local recurrence (median follow -up, 41.4 months).57 In total, \n13 patients received treatment for operative complications and 18 patients (10.7%) died from penile cancer. An earlier retrospective study \nincluding 25 patients demonstrated a DSS of 92%.\n58 A systematic \nreview of 20 studies on glansectomy reported a local recurrence rate of 2.6%  to 16.7% and incidence of salvage penectomy due to positive \nmargins and/or recurrence of 1.2 % to 8.3%.\n59 The DSS in this study \nwas 89%  to 96.6%. Taken together, studies indicate a low level of \nrecurrence.48,58,60- 62 Good cosmetic outcomes and normal erections \nfollowing glansectomy were reported in a majority of cases (95 %–100% \nand 50% –100%, respectively).59 Wide Local Excision  \nFor wide local excision, a complete excision of the skin with a wide negative margin with skin grafting is needed. Surgical margins depend \non the location of the tumor. Penile tumors of the shaft may be treated \nwith wide local excision, with or without cir cumcision. Circumcision \nalone may be reasonable for tumors of the distal prepuce. Either a split-thickness skin graft or full -thickness skin graft may be considered. \nEmphasis is placed again on patient selection and close follow -up, as \nthe 2 -year recurrenc e rate may reach up to 50%.\n63 A systematic review \nthat reported on wide local excision for treatment of P eIN reported a \nrecurrence rate of 25%.48 Studies have shown that surgical margins of 5 \nto 10 mm are as safe as 2 -cm surgical margins, and 10-  to 20 -mm \nmargins provide adequate tumor control.64  \nMohs Surgery  \nMohs surgery is an alternative to wide local excision in select patients.65 \nThis technique removes thin layers of cancerous skin, which are \nevaluated microscopically until the tissue is negative for tumor. A \nretrospective study including 33 patients with SCC of the penis, ranging \nfrom PeIN  to T3 disease, reported outcomes for patients who were \ntreated with Mohs surgery.66 Follow -up data were available for 25 \npatients, of which 8 had local recurrence. Seven patients underwent \nrepeat Mohs surgery while one patient received a penectomy. One \npatient in this study died of metastatic disease. A systematic review \nreported a 4% recurrence rate for P eIN treated with Mohs surgery.48 \nAlthough precision is higher with Mohs surgery, the success rate \ndeclines with higher stage of disease. Therefore, Mohs surgery may \nhave the greatest benefit for patients with a small superficial lesion on \nthe proximal shaft to avoid penectomy for an otherwise fair ly low- risk \nlesion.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPenile Cancer   \n \nMS-8 \nNCCN Recommendations \nPeIN  or Ta  \nFor patients with penile PeIN  or noninvasive verrucous carcinoma, \npenis -preserving techniques may be used, including topical imiquimod \n(5%) or 5 -FU cream, circumcision and wide local excision, laser therapy \n(category 2B), complete glansectomy (category 2B), or Mohs surgery in \nselect cases (category 2B). Among these, topical therapy67-69 and \nexcisional organ- sparing surgery70 are the most widely used.  \nFor topical therapy, NCCN recommends application of imiquimod 5% \ncream at night 3 times per week for 4 to 16 weeks. Topical 5% 5 -FU \ncream should be applied twice daily for 2 to 6 weeks. Laser therapy for the treatment of primary penile tumors has demonstra ted acceptable \noutcomes with a perioperative application of between 3% and 5% acetic \nacid. Following application of acetic acid to the affected genital skin, \nsuspected sites of HPV -infected skin will turn white and can be targeted \nfor laser ablation. Gas a nd solid- state lasers may be considered (see \nPrinciples of Penile Organ- Sparing Approaches  in the algorithm).  \npT1a  \nCareful consideration should be given to penile- preserving techniques if \nthe patient is willing and able to undergo close follow -up. These \ntechniques include wide local excision,65 glansectomy in select cases, \nMohs surgery in select cases (category 2B), laser therapy (category \n2B),71 and radi ation therapy  (RT) (category 2B) delivered as \nbrachytherapy with interstitial implant (preferred) or external beam RT  \n(EBRT) .72-76 Circumcision should always precede RT to prevent \nradiation- related complications.  In cases where a penile- preserving \ntechnique is not feasible based on the size or location of the tumor, \npartial penectomy may be appropriate.  pT1b  or T≥2  \nThese lesions typically require more extensive surgical intervention with \npartial or total penectomy depending on the characteristics of the tumor \nand depth of invasion.77 Intraoperative frozen sectioning is \nrecommended to achieve negative surgical margins. If the tumor \nencompasses less than half of the glans and the patient agrees to very \nclose observation, then a more conservative approach such as wide \nlocal excision or glansectomy may be considered for patients with pT1b \ndiagnosis. The patient should understand that there is an increased risk for recurrence and potential for a repeat wide local excision should a \nlocal recurrence be noted, provided there is no invasion of the corpora \ncavernosa.\n53,62 A clear and frank discussion should be had with the \npatient in whom  a partial or total penectomy will likely be required \nshould a larger or more invasive lesion be present.  \nThe tumor size is an important factor when choosing RT as treatment. \nAs the average length of the glans is approximately  4 cm, this serves as \na cutpoint to reduce the risk of undertreating cavernosal lesions. In a study of 144 patients with penile cancer restricted to the glans treated \nby brachytherapy, larger tumors, especially those >4 cm, were \nassociated with higher risk of recurrence.\n78 A high, 10 -year, \ncancer -specific survival rate of 92% was achieved in this series.  \nThere was nonuniform consensus among NCCN panelists on the use of \nRT as primary therapy due to scant data. For p T1b or T2 tumors < 4 cm \nwith negative nodes, brachytherapy with interstitial implant  (category \n2B), EBRT alone (category 2B), or EBRT with chemotherapy (category \n3) are treatment options after circumcision. Consider prophylactic ILN irradiation in patients who are not surgical candidates or those who \ndecline surgical management  if selecting prophylactic EBRT.  \nFor tumors ≥ 4 cm or if there is node -positive disease that is surgically \nunresectable, circumcision should be performed followed by EBRT PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:40 PM.

Brachytherapy following circumcision \nmay be appropriate in select cases of tumors ≥4 cm, but careful \nmonitoring is necessary as the risks of complications and disease progression  increase.\n79 Crook and colleagues reported a 10 -year \ncause- specific survival of 84% in 67 patients with T1– 2 (select cases of \nT3) penile lesions treated with primary brachytherapy.76 A meta -analysis \ncomparing the efficacy of brachytherapy and penectomy reported \nsimilar 5 -year OS rates between these two treatments (76% for \npenectomy vs . 74% for brachytherapy; odds ratio [OR], 0.79; 95% CI, \n0.64– 0.98), although patients who underwent penectomy had higher 5 -\nyear local control rates (85% vs . 80%; OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58– 0.90) \nand 5-year disease -free survival  rates (77% vs . 72%; OR, 0.77; 95% CI, \n0.63– 0.93).80 However, one must be cautious in interpreting from this \nthat brachytherapy and penectomy  offer equally effective oncologic \noutcomes since  selection criteria can affect the efficacy and suitability of \nthese primary treatment options for the individual patients. \nBrachytherapy is not recommended following penectomy or partial \npenectomy but may be considered following wide local excision or \nexcisional biopsy of small lesions. Brachytherapy should only be \nperformed in centers with significant experience using this tr eatment \nmodality.  \nPost-surgical RT to the primary tumor site may be considered for \npositive margins.  \nManagement of Regional Lymph Nodes  \nEvaluation and Risk Stratification  \nThe presence and extent of regional ILN metastases has been \nidentified as the single most important prognostic indicator in \ndetermining long- term survival in patients  with invasive penile SCC.31 \nEvaluation of the groin and pelvis is an essential component of the metastatic workup of a patient. The involvement of the ILN can be clinically evident (ie, palpable vs. nonpalpable), adding to the difficulty in \nmanagement. Clinical exam ination for ILN involvement should attempt \nto evaluate and assess for palpability, number of inguinal masses, \nunilateral or bilateral localization, dimensions, mobility or fixation of \nnodes or masses, relationship to other structures (eg, skin, Cooper’s \nligaments ), and edema of the penis, scrotum, and/or legs.\n39,81 \nCrossover drainage from left to right and vice versa occur s and is \nreproducible with lymphoscintigraphy.5,82 The physical exam ination \nshould describe the diameter of node(s) or mass(es), unilateral or bilateral localization, number of nodes identified in each inguinal region, \nand the relationship to other structures, particularly with respect to the \nmobility or fixation of the node(s) or mass(es) to adjacent structures \nand/or involvement of the overlying skin.  \nCross -sectional i maging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis by  CT or \nMRI may be used to assess the size, extent, location, and structures \nthat are in close proximity to the ILN, as well as the presence of pelvic \nand retroperitoneal lymph nodes and distant metastasis.\n83,84 Imaging is \nan important addition to bilateral palpation as 13 % to 16% of patients \nwithout palpable lymph nodes still have occult metastases and 20%  to \n40% of patients with palpable lymph nodes are found to be non -\nmetastatic .83,85 When considering one imaging modality to evaluate the \nstage of the primary lesion and lymph node status, MRI appears to be \nthe best choice to enhance the physical exam ination in patients where \nthe inguinal region is difficult to assess (eg, morbidity, previous chemotherapy/RT).\n86-88 Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG )-PET/CT  is best \nused as a diagnostic modality in those patients with cN+ penile cancer \nfollowing other imaging studies showing concern for more extensive \nburden of metastatic disease.89-94 A systematic review and meta-\nanalysis evaluating the accuracy of FDG -PET/CT for diagnosing ILN \ninvolvement in penile cancer found that PET/CT had a relatively low \npooled sensitivity for detection of ILN metastasis in patients with cN0 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:40 PM.

If one or more of these \nhigh- risk features is present, then pathologic ILN staging must be \nperformed. Up to 25% of patients with nonpalpable l ymph nodes harbor \nmicrometastases.96 Therefore, several predictive factors have been \nevaluated for their ability to identify the presence of occult lymph node metastasis.\n63,97 Slaton et al96 concluded that patients with pathologic \nstage T2 or greater disease were at significant risk (42% –80%) of nodal \nmetastases if they exhibited >50% poorly differentiated cancer and/or \nvascular invasion, and therefore should be recommended to undergo an inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND).\n5,96 These factors can then \nfurther define patients into low -, intermediate -, and high- risk groups for \nlymph node metastasis.29,98,99 The European Association of Urology \ndetermined risk stratification groups for patients with nonpalpable ILNs, \nand validated this in both uni - and multivariate analyses of prognostic \nfactors.  Patients can be stratified based on stage and/or grade into risk \ngroups based on the likelihood of harboring occult node- positive \ndisease, with the low -risk group defined as patients with PeIN , Ta, or \nT1a disease; the intermediate group as those with T1b disease \n(lymphovascular invasion); and the high- risk group as those with T2 or \nG3/G4 disease.98,100 Other  systematic and retrospective review s \nidentified lymphovascular invasion, higher grade tumors, higher stage \ntumors (both clinical and pathological), infiltrative and reticular invasion, \nincreased depth of invasion, perineural invasion, and younger age at \ndiagnosis as clinical risk factors predictive of inguinal lymph node \nmetastases in penile SCC.101,102 Of these risk factors, lymphovascular \ninvasion and tumor grade were most strongly associated with lymph \nnode metastasis.101   There is a paucity of data regarding the predictive value of lymph node \nremoval. A singular study suggests that DSS following radical \nlymphadenectomy can be predicted by the lymph node count and lymph \nnode density.103 Removal of ≥16 lymph nodes in patients with \npathologic negative nodes was associated with a significantly longer DSS rate ( P < .05). Furthermore, the 5- year disease- free survival rate in \npatients with pathologic positive nodes was 81.2% in patients with \nlymph node density (defined as the number of positive nodes divided by \nthe total number of lymph nodes removed) > 16% compared to 24.4% in \npatients with < 16% lymph node density ( P < .001).\n103 Although this \nstudy suggests that lymph node count and density may be useful in \npredicting DSS, a larger validation study is necessary to support these \npreliminary data.  \nDynamic Sentinel Node Biopsy  \nThe work by Cabanas used lymphangiograms and anatomic dissections \nto evaluate the sentinel lymph node drainage for penile cancer with \nnonpalpable ILNs.104 This technique has been shown to have \nfalse -negative rates as high as 25%; therefore, it is no longer \nrecommended.39,105 Advancements have been made with the dynamic \nsentinel node biopsy (DSNB) technique developed for penile cancer by \nthe Netherlands Cancer Institute using lymphoscintigraphy and \nperformed with technetium -99m–labeled nanocolloid and patent blue \ndye isosulfan blue.106,107 Initially, this technique was associated with a \nlow sensitivity and high false- negative rate (16% –43%).108- 111 \nRefinement of the technique to include serial sectioning and \nimmunohistochemical staining of pathologic specimens, preoperative \nultrasonography with and without fine- needle aspiration (FNA) cytology, \nand exploration of groins in which no sentinel node is visualized on intraoperative assessment decreased the false- negative rate from 19% \nto only 5%.\n106,112,113 Using FNA with ultrasound can increase the \ndiagnostic yield in metastases >2 mm in diameter.85,114 Crashaw et al115 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:40 PM.

With modification of the \nNational Cancer Institute ( NCI) protocol, Hadway et al116 were able to \nachieve a similar false -negative rate (5%) with an 11- month follow -up. \nAn observational cohort study of 1000 patients treated between 1956 \nand 2012 suggests that DSNB can improve 5 -year survival in patients \nwith clinically node -negative groins.117 Data in this study showed that \npatients treated prior to 1994 (the year DSNB was incorporated into \ntreatment) had an 82% 5 -year survival compared to the 91% 5 -year \nsurvival seen in patients treated between 1994 and 2012 ( P = .021). \nHowever, there are several limitations of this study, including the \npossibility that improved staging resulted in more patients being \ngrouped into  a higher risk group. In addition, a systematic review of \nstudies on DSNB for clinically impalpable lymph nodes published between 2000 and 2022 concluded that the diagnostic accuracy of \nDSNB requires further improvement as a high proportion of patients \nwith a positive DSNB undergo unnecessary radical lymph node \ndissection.\n118 Therefore, incorporation of DSNB into treatment should \nbe limited to centers with experience. Secondary to the technical \nchallenges associated with DSNB, to be accurate and reliable, it is \nrecommended that DSNB be performed at tertiary care referral center s \nwhere at least 20 procedures are done per year .106,119 It should be noted \nthat DSNB is not recommended in patients with palpable ILNs.81 \nInguinal Lymph Node Dissection  \nThe most frequent sites of metastasis from penile cancer are the ILNs, \ntypically presenting as palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy. The \nmanagement of ILNs by ILND has been fraught with concerns of \nsurgical morbidity.39,120 Early treatment of lymph node involvement has \nbeen shown to have a positive impact on survival, except if the patient \nhas bulky nodal spread or other sites of metastases.121- 123 Palpable \nlymphadenopathy at the time of diagnosis does not warrant an immediate ILND. Of the patients with palpable disease, 30% to 50% will \nbe secondary to inflammatory lymph node swelling instead of metastatic \ndisease.97 Although the distinction between reactive lymph nodes and \nmetastatic disease has traditionally been done with a 6 -week course of \nantibiotics, percutaneous lymph node biopsy is the favored approach \namong penile cancer experts for patients with palpable nodes.5,81 An \nantibiotic course may still be used but is limited to the setting of an overlying infection.\n5,81,124 Data on robotic ILND are limited, although a \nsystematic review has reported that the robotic approach is safe and effective, with lower morbidity than open surgery  when carefully \nselecting for patients  with non- palpable or non- bulky inguinal nodes .\n125 \nThe boundaries of the standard, full -template ILND (ie, Daseler’s \nquadrilateral area) are: superiorly, the inguinal ligament; inferiorly, the \nfossa ovalis; laterally, the medical border of sartorius muscle; and \nmedially, the lateral edge of adductor longus  muscle.124 Historically, it \nhas been recommended to keep the patient on bed rest for 48 to 72 \nhours, especially after myocutaneous flaps or repair of large skin \ndefects, although the necessity for this is debatable and not \ncorroborated with rigorous scientific data.  Closed suction drains are \nplaced at surgery and are typically removed when drainage is < 50 to \n100 mL per day.124,126 Consideration should be given to keeping the \npatient on a suppressive dose of an oral cephalosporin (or other gram -positive, broad -spectrum antibiotic) for several days to weeks \npostoperatively in an attempt to decrease the risk of wound- related \nissues and minimize the risk of overall complications. However, the data \nsupporting this treatment approach are very limited.\n124 \nModified Template Lymphadenectomy  \nIn attempts to decrease the morbidity associated with standard ILND, a modified template lymphadenectomy has been proposed that uses a \nshorter skin incision, limiting the field of inguinal dissection by excluding PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:40 PM.

This technique is commonly reserved  for patients with a primary \ntumor that places them at increased risk for inguinal metastasis but with clinically negative groins on examination.\n124,127 The modified technique \nhas shown a decrease in complications. Contemporary modified ILND should include the central and superior zones of the inguinal region, as \nthese sections were not included in the dissection leading to a \nfalse -negative rate of 15%.\n128,129 It is important to note that if nodal \ninvolvement is detected on frozen section, the surgical procedure should be converted to a standard, full -template lymphadenectomy. A \nstandard full -template lymphadenectomy should be considered in all \npatients who have resectable inguinal lymphadenopathy. However, \nstudies would favor neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to proceeding with \nsurgery, particularly in patients with bulky ILN metastases (ie, fixed \nnodes or nodal diameter >3 cm).\n130- 132 Generally, ILND is performed \nwithin 4 to 6 weeks following the completion of systemic chemotherapy to allow patient recovery while minimizing the risk of cancer progression \npost-chemotherapy.  \nDelayed Inguinal Lymphadenectomy  \nSince data exist that suggest patients  with clinically negative groins \nundergoing immediate ILND have better survival outcomes than patients  undergoing delayed ILND once their groins are clinically \npositive, it is recommended that in most circumstances , patients  with \nhigh- risk penile tumors should undergo immediate ILND. However, \npatients with lower -risk tumors who are undergoing active surveillance \nor patients w ith high- risk tumors  who refuse immediate ILND may \nexperience an inguinal nodal recurrence at some time point during follow- up. The median time to inguinal recurrence after treatment of the primary penile tumor is approximately 6 months, with 90% occurring by year 3 and 100% by year 5.\n133- 135  \nUnilateral Versus Bilateral Lymphadenectomy  \nIn patients with intermediate- or high- risk features who do not have \npalpable lymph nodes, bilateral lymphadenectomy is generally performed, because it is not possible to predict the laterality of inguinal \nnodal metastasis based on the location of the tumor on the penis. \nSimilarly, in patients who have a unilateral palpable node, \napproximately  30% will have contralateral positive nodes that are not \npalpable.\n136 Therefore, bilateral lymphadenectomy is recommended in \npatients undergoing immediate ILND for high- risk penile tumors or \nbecause of palpable nodes. When there is a delayed (>1 year after treatment of the primary penile tumor) inguinal recurrence of cancer, it \nis usually unilateral, and some authors have suggested that ipsilateral \nILND is adequate while others have advocated for bilateral ILND in this \ncircumstance.\n5 \nPelvic Lymphadenectomy  \nApproximately 20% to 30% of patients with positive ILNs will also have cancer within PLNs. Interestingly, penile tumors do not appear to \nmetastasize to the PLNs without first affecting the inguinal node echelon \n(ie, no skip lesions).\n104,135 Patients who have only one positive inguinal \nnode have a risk of pelvic nodal involvement of <5% as reported by the \nNetherlands Cancer Institute.137 The presence of cancer within the PLN \nis associated with a very poor 5 -year survival rate that is typically < 10%. \nBased on these prior reports, pelvic lymphadenectomy (resection of \nexternal iliac, internal iliac, and obturator lymph nodes) is recommended \nin patients with three  or more positive ILNs and in the clinical context of \nhigh- grade cancer within the ILN pathologic specimen. Pelvic lymph \nnode dissection (PLND) can be conducted during the same operative \nsession as the ILND if the intraoperative frozen section is positive in PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:40 PM.

Data \nsuggest that the number of positive ILNs identified at the time of \ndissection may direct clinicians to unilateral or bilateral dissection. In a \nsingle retrospective study, the presence of four  or more positive ILNs \nsupported bilateral PLND.\n106 Unilateral PLND was recommended if \nthree  or fewer ILN metastases were identified and if there was no \nsuspicion of contralateral  pelvic lymphadenopathy on preoperative \nimaging or intraoperatively. Crossover (right to left or left to right) of \ninguinal to pelvic nodes has not been well -studied; hence, both \napproaches are feasible and left at the discretion of the surgeon based \non case -specific characteristics.  \nPerioperative Therapy for  Lymph Node Dissection  \nPatients with penile cancer that has metastasized to the lymph nodes often have a poor prognosis, wit h a 5- year survival rate of ≤70% \nfollowing lymph node dissection, depending on the presence  of adverse \nfeatures.\n140- 142 While it is clear that lymph node dissection alone is \ninadequate for  many  patients with node- positive penile cancer, t here is \na lack of prospective data to inform optimal strategies for perioperative therapy in this situation . The phase III International Penile Advanced \nCancer Trial (InPACT) seeks to provide data on potential strategies for \nperioperative therapy  by incorporating  two sequential randomizations.\n143 \nThe InPACT- Neoadjuvant randomization randomizes patients to ILND  \n(no neoadjuvant therapy), neoadjuvant chemotherapy  followed by ILND , \nor neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy  followed by ILND . The \nInPACT -Pelvic randomization randomizes patients with pathologically \nhigh- risk disease from ILND to prophylactic PLND or no pr ophylactic surgery with both arms receiving adjuvant chemoradiotherapy  if the \npatient did not receive  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.  \nChemotherapy  \nA patient who presents with resectable bulky disease will rarely be cured with a single treatment modality ; therefore,  consideration should \nbe given to neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to ILND.  Patients who may \nbenefit from surgical consolidation would be those who had stable, \npartial, or CR following systemic chemotherapy, thus increasing their \npotential for disease- free survival.\n130,131 Pagliaro et al144 performed a \nphase II clinical trial in 30 patients, with stage N2 or N3 (stage III or \nstage IV) penile cancer without distant metastases, receiving \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin. In \nthis series, 50% of patients were noted to have a clinically meaningful \nresponse, and 22 patients (73.3%) subsequently underwent surgery. \nThere was an improved time to progression and OS associated with \nchemotherapy responsiveness ( P < .001 and P  = .001, respectively), \nabsence of bilateral residual tumor ( P = .002 and P = .017, \nrespectively), and absence of extranodal extension ( P = .001 and \nP = .004, respectively) or skin involvement ( P = .009 and P  = .012, \nrespectively).  A systematic review and meta- analysis of 10 studies of \npatients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced \npenile SCC reported similar results, with an objective response rate \n(ORR) of 53% (95% CI, 42– 64) and 16% showing pathologic CR.132 \nThis review favored platinum -based neoadjuvant chemotherapy over \ntaxane- based due to higher response rates and lower rates of grade \nthree or higher AEs for platinum -based chemotherapy in the stratified \nsubanalysis.  \nA retrospective analysis evaluated the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy \non OS of patients with positive PLN following lymph node dissection.

These patients were younger, \nhad a less aggressive pathology, were less inclined to receive adjuvant \nRT, and demonstrated less bilateral inguinal disease and more inguinal \nextranodal extension. The median OS was higher for these patients compared to patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (21.7 \nvs. 10.1 months; P = .021). Adjuvant chemotherapy was further shown \nto be an independent factor in the improved OS based on multivariate analysis (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0. 19–0.87; P = .021).\n145 Therefore, patients \nwith positive PLN s following surgical resection may benefit from \nadjuvant RT or systemic chemotherapy.  A systematic review and meta -\nanalysis comparing the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy to \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with lymph node- positive penile \ncancer did not find clear evidence to support one over the other.146 \nWhile n o differences were found when comparing adjuvant versus \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant versus no intervention, OS  was \nhigher with neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to no intervention and \nPFS was higher with adjuvant compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.   \nRadiotherapy  \nA multicenter, retrospective analysis evaluated the benefit of adjuvant \npelvic RT on OS and disease recurrence in 92 patients with positive \nPLNs following PLND. Patients who received adjuvant pelvic RT  (n = \n40) had a longer median DSS than those who did not receive RT  (14.4 \nvs. 8 months; P = .023). Additionally, patients who did not undergo \nadjuvant RT had worse OS (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.01– 2.92; P = .04) and \nDSS (HR,  1.9; 95% CI, 1.09– 3.36; P = .02).147  \nStudies investigating the role of adjuvant RT for positive lymph nodes \nfollowing ILND have been mixed. A  retrospective analysis of National \nCancer Database records  showed improved OS with adjuvant RT \nfollowing ILND for stage III penile cancer (HR, 0.58;  95% CI, 0.39–\n0.86). Patients with higher nodal burden of disease showed greater benefit from adjuvant RT.148 However , a systematic review by the \nEuropean Association of Urology Penile Cancer Guidelines Panel \nreported that the few studies comparing recurrence and survival \nbetween patients who did or did not receive adjuvant RT after ILND for \nlymph -node positive disease received no significant benefit from the \nadjuvant RT.149 Therefore, adjuvant RT is recommended following a \nPLND after a positive result on ILND.  \nChemoradiotherapy  \nChemoradiotherapy has demonstrated improved responses in patients with other SCCs, specifically patients with vulvar and anal cancer.\n150- 153 \nAnecdotal data for the use of chemoradiotherapy in patients with penile \ncancer have been reported with mixed results.154- 157 Based on the \nlimited data, chemoradiotherapy is a treatment option in select patients.  \nFor patients with T1 or T2 disease, EBRT with concurrent \nchemotherapy may be considered,  although brachytherapy is preferred \nfor tumors < 4 cm. Similarly, EBRT with concurrent chemotherapy can \nbe used for T3 or T4 disease or in patients with nodal involvement. \nPostoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended in patients who \nhave ILN-positive  disease. Chemoradiotherapy can be considered for \npatients with high- risk features including PLN metastases, extranodal \nextension, bilateral ILN involvement, and tumors  in lymph nodes > 4 cm.  \nChemoradiotherapy is a recommended strategy for patients with \nresistant disease. The use of chemoradiotherapy as primary treatment \nis a category 3 recommendation due to the limited studies that have \ninvestigated its role for treatment of penile cancer. For  patients with \npalpable, non- bulky pN2 or pN3 disease, treatment may entail adjuvant \nRT, chemoradiotherapy, or chemotherapy following ILND or PLND. \nChemoradiotherapy is recommended for the management of enlarged \nPLNs in nonsurgical candidates  or for local recurrence in the inguinal \nregion or metastatic penile cancer.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPenile Cancer   \n \nMS-15 \nNCCN Recommendations \nNonpalpable Nodes  \nMost patients with low-risk disease (PeIN , Ta, T1a) are followed with a \nsurveillance protocol, as the probability of occult micrometastases in \nILNs is <17%.98,134 For patients at intermediate (T1b, G1–2) or high \n(T1b, G3–4; T2 or greater) risk, a modified or radical bilateral inguinal \nlymphadenectomy is strongly recommended as occult metastatic \ndisease ranges between 68% and 73%.63,98,134 If positive nodes are \npresent on the frozen section, then a superficial and deep inguinal \nlymphadenectomy should be performed (with consideration of a PLND).  \nProphylactic EBRT (category 2B) to the ILNs should be considered in patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo surgical management.  \nAlternatively, bilateral DSNB may be done for intermediate - or high -risk \nlesions if the treating physician has experience with this modality . As \nDSNB is currently not widely practiced in the United States, this \ntechnique should be performed in tertiary care referral centers with \nsubstantial experience. DSNB is not recommended for  low-risk (PeIN , \nTa, or T1a)  tumors, as observation alone is sufficient in the absence of \npalpable adenopathy.  \nUnilateral Palpable Nodes <4 cm (mobile)  \nPercutaneous lymph node biopsy  of the most accessible node is \nconsidered standard for these patients if no risk feature is present in the primary lesion. Risk features include T1 tumors; high grade; \nlymphovascular or perineural invasion; and poor differentiation in more \nthan half of the tumor cells. The NCCN Panel recommends omitting the \nprocedure for patients with high- risk primary lesions to avoid delay of \nlymphadenectomy. A negative lymph node biopsy may  be confirmed \nwith an excisional biopsy. Alternativ ely, careful surveillance may be \nconsidered following a negative lymph node biopsy. Positive findings from either procedure warrant an immediate bilateral ILND or consideration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by ILND . \nAdditionally, in cases of pN2– 3 disease, a PLND with or without \nadjuvant RT, chemotherapy (category 2B), or chemoradiotherapy \n(category 2B) is recommended. Alternatively, chemoradiotherapy or \nchemotherapy alone may be given (both are category 2B \nrecommendations). Following treatment, all patients should enter active \nsurveillance.   \nUnilateral Palpable Nodes ≥ 4 cm (mobile)  \nLarge, unilateral, mobile nodes should first be confirmed by percutaneous lymph node biopsy. A negative biopsy should be \nconfirmed by an excisional biopsy. If results are negative again, the \npatient should be closely followed. It is preferred that patients with \nconfirmed nodes receive a standard or modified ILND , with \nconsideration of PLND . Neoadjuvant cisplatin -based chemotherapy is \nrecommended  before surgery , although ILND  and/or PLND  can be \nperformed without neoadjuvant therapy in patients who are not el igible \nfor cisplatin -based chemotherapy . Alternatively, RT or \nchemoradiotherapy may be administered following a positive \npercutaneous lymph node biopsy.  \nNo further treatment is necessary if no viable tumor elements are \ndetected in the surgical specimen or if only one node is positive . If two \nor more positive nodes or extranodal extension is detected, adjuvant chemotherapy (if not already given) and/or adjuvant RT  (if PLNs  are \npositive ) is recommended. Alternatively, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy \nmay be given (category 2B). Data suggest that in the setting of four or \nmore positive ILNs, a bilateral PLND should be performed , if not already \ndone.\n158 Postoperative RT or chemoradiotherapy may be considered in \npatients after PLND, particularly in the setting of a positive surgical \nmargin, if there is viable cancer in multiple ILNs or PLNs, and/or if there \nis a presence of extranodal extension on the final pathologic specimen.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPenile Cancer   \n \nMS-16 \nUnilateral Fixed Lymph Nodes or Bilateral Palpable Nodes (fixed or \nmobile)  \nFor large, unilateral, fixed nodes or bilateral ILNs, patients should \nundergo a percutaneous lymph node biopsy of the  most accessible \ninguinal or pelvic  lymph node. A negative result should be confirmed \nwith excisional biopsy. If results are again negative, the patient should \nbe closely followed. Patients with a positive aspiration or biopsy should \nreceive neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy followed by ILN D and \nPLND if there is a response to the chemotherapy. Postoperative RT or chemoradiotherapy may be cons idered  if there is extranodal extension  \n(category 2B). As previously mentioned, in the setting of four or more \npositive ILNs, a bilateral PLND should be performed.\n158 Alternatively, \nradiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy may be done instead of ILND/PLND, although this is not the preferred option for most patients. If \nthe patient’s disease does not respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, \ntreatment may follow options for progressive metastatic disease.  If the \npatient is not eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (eg, cisplatin \nineligibility), the recommended surgical (preferred) or radiotherapy \noptions may be performed without neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  \nEnlarged Pelvic Lymph Nodes  \nPatients with abnormal PLNs on imaging (CT or MRI) should undergo a \npercutaneous lymph node biopsy if technically feasible. If positive, \npatients are stratified by resectability. Nonsurgical candidates  should be \ntreated with chemoradiotherapy. Surgical candidates  should receive \nneoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy followed by cross -sectional \nimaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to assess for response . \nPatients with disease that responds to therapy or that becomes stable \nshould undergo bilateral superficial and deep ILND and \nunilateral/bilateral PLND if deemed resectable. Postoperative RT or \nchemoradiotherapy may be considered if advanced pathologic nodal \nstaging (pN2– 3) or extranodal extension are present  (category 2B). Patients with disease that progresses may receive additional systemic \nchemotherapy with consideration of local -field RT or participation in a \nclinical trial.  \nSurveillance \nInitial treatment of the primary tumor and lymph nodes dictates the \nfollow- up schedule (see Surveillance Schedule in the algorithm). A large \nretrospective review of 700 patients found that penile- sparing therapies \ncarry a significantly higher risk of local recurrence (28%) than partial or \ntotal penectomy (5%) and thus require closer surveillance.135 Patients \nwithout nodal involvement had a regional recurrence rate of 2% compared to 19% for patients with node -positive disease. Of all \nrecurrences, 92% were detected within 5 years of primary treatment.  \nA retrospective analysis of 551 patients with penile cancer who were \ntreated with ILND found that recurrence occurred in 31.9% of \npatients.\n159 Median time to recurrence was 10 months for distant \nrecurrence, 12 months for inguinal recurrence, 10.5 months for pelvic recurrence, and 44.5 months for local recurrence.  Greater than 95% of \ndistant, inguinal, and pelvic recurrence occurred within 48 months of \nILND, compared to 127 months for local recurrences, supporting a \nshorter imaging surveillance schedule for detection of regional or distant \nrecurrences . However , it took 127 months for 95% of local recurrences \nto be detected, supporting long- term surveillance of the primary site by \nclinical exam ination.   \nFollow -up for all patients includes a clinical exam ination of the penis \nand inguinal region. Imaging is not routinely indicated for early disease \n(except for patients who have obesity  or who have undergone inguinal \nsurgery since a physical exam ination may be challenging), but may be \nused on abnormal findings. For patients with N2 or N3 disease, imaging \nof the chest, abdomen, and pelvi s area is recommended.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPenile Cancer   \n \nMS-17 \nRecurrence  \nInvasive disease  is an adverse finding after initial organ -sparing \ntreatment and should be treated according to the stage of the \nrecurrence.160,161 For noninvasive primary tumor recurrences, treatment \nshould also be based on the stage of recurrence . \nA recurrence in the inguinal region carries a poor prognosis (median \nsurvival, <6 months) and optimal management remains elusive. If no \nprior inguinal lymphadenectomy or RT was given, primary treatment for \nthe management of ILNs can be followed. If the pat ient previously \nreceived lymphadenectomy or RT, subsequent -line therapies include \nchemotherapy followed by ILND, ILND alone, or chemoradiotherapy (if \nno prior RT).81,162 A study suggests that ILND may be beneficial in \npatients with penile cancer with locally recurrent ILN metastases.163 \nWhile potentially curative, patients must be advised of the high \nincidence of postoperative complications.163  \nMetastatic Disease  \nImaging of the chest, abdomen,  and pelvis should be obtained when \nmetastasis is suspected to evaluate for pelvic and/or retroperitoneal \nlymph nodes  and more distant metastas es. Broad molecular/genomic \ntesting in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) \nlaboratory should also be considered for patients with metastatic \ndisease to evaluate for potentially rare but actionable mutations or gene \nfusions.  PLN metastasis is an ominous finding, with a 5- year survival \nrate of 0% to 66% for all cases and 17%  to 54% for microscopic \ninvasion only, with a mean 5- year survival of approximately 10%.5,164 -168 \nIn patients with ILN metastases, 20% to 30% will have PLN metastases.\n5 This can be further characterized such that if two to three  \nILNs are involved, there is a 23% probability of PLN involvement. With \ninvolvement of three  or more ILNs, this probability increases to 56%.169  Lughezzani et al138 identified three  independent predictors of PLN \nmetastases that included the number of inguinal metastases (OR, 1.92; \nP < .001), the diameter of the metastases (OR, 1.03; P  = .001), and \nextranodal extension (OR, 8.01; P  < .001). Similar to previous studies, \npatients with three or more ILN metastases had a 4.77 -fold higher risk \nof PLN metastasis. An ILN metastasis diameter of ≥ 30 mm correlated \nwith a 2.53- fold higher risk of PLN metastasis. Patients who showed no \nrisk factors had a 0% risk of metastasis, suggesting that this group may \nnot require PLND.138  \nPettaway et al170 evaluated the treatment options for stage IV penile \ncancer —clinical stage N3 (deep inguinal nodes or pelvic nodes) or M1 \ndisease (distant metastases) —including chemotherapy, RT, and \ninguinal lymphadenectomy  and concluded that treatment with cisplatin -\nbased chemotherapy should be considered and might facilitate curative \nresection . The role of RT was considered to be mostly palliative. \nCisplatin -based regimens (paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin [TIP]  or \nalternatively 5 -FU plus cisplatin) are the most act ive first -line systemic \nchemotherapy regimens.39,144,171 The recent ly presented HERCULES \n(LACOG 0218)  phase II trial  also demonstrated potential  efficacy of \nplatinum -based chemotherapy  plus pembrolizumab followed by \npembrolizumab maintenance for up to 34 cycles  in 37 patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic penile SCC .172 The primary endpoint,  \nconfirmed ORR as assessed by investigator , was found to be  39.4% \nwith 1 complete response and 12 partial responses  being observed \nalong with a manageable safety profile.172 Therefore, the NCCN Panel \nrecommends first -line chemotherapy using TIP (preferred), 5- FU plus \ncisplatin, or 5 -FU plus cisplatin or carboplatin  plus pembrolizumab \nfollowed by  pembrolizumab maintenance for metastatic penile cancer . \nVinflunine has also shown activity as a first -line treatment in a phase II \nclinical trial of 25 patients with inoperable, locally advanced or \nmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, although this PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:58:40 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nPenile Cancer   \n \nMS-18 \ntreatment is not currently recommended in the Guidelines.173 The Panel \ndoes not recommend regimens containing bleomycin because of high \npulmonary -related toxicity.174 A retrospective analysis of 30 patients \nwith non-metastatic  N2 or N3 penile cancer who received neoadjuvant \ncisplatin -based chemotherapy as first -line treatment demonstrated a \npoor response to treatment when disease progressed (median OS , <6 \nmonths).175 Patients with a proven objective response to systemic \nchemotherapy are amenable to consolidative ILND with curative \npotential or palliation. However, surgical consolidation should not be \nperformed on patients with disease that progresses during systemic \nchemotherapy except for local symptomatic control. Preoperative RT \nmay also be given to patients who have lymph nodes ≥ 4 cm without \nskin fixation to improve surgical resectability and decrease local \nrecurrence.  \nIf there is no response or disease progression following first -line \nchemotherapy, subsequent therapy options include subsequent -line \nsystemic therapy , RT for local control , and/or best supportive care.  For \npatients with unresectable inguinal or bone metastases, RT may \nprovide a palliative benefit after chemotherapy.  Additionally, any tumor -\nagnostic treatments  that cover penile cancer should also be considered \nat this time based on molecular/genomic testing.  The NCCN Panel \nstrongly recommends consideration of clinical trial participation as data are limited in the second -line setting.  \nThe immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, has received two tumor -agnostic indications, one for unresectable or metastatic \nmicrosatellite instability -high (MSI -H) or mismatch repair -deficient \n(dMMR)  solid tumors; and the second is for unresectable or metastatic \ntumor mutational burden -high (TMB -H) solid tumors.\n176 Both of these \nindications are for patients with disease that has progressed following \nprior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.  The phase II KEYNOTE- 158 study evaluated the efficacy of \npembrolizumab in patients with MSI -H/dMMR previously treated, \nadvanced non- colorectal cancer.177 After a median follow -up of 13.4 \nmonths, ORR was 34.3%, median PFS was 4.1 months, and median OS was 23.5 months. Grade 3 or higher AEs occurred in 14.6% of \npatients, with one treatment -related fatality from pneumonia. An earlier \nphase II trial that also investigated use of pembrolizumab for dMMR \ndisease across several tumor types reported similar results.\n178 The \nphase II KEYNOTE -158 study evaluated the use of pembrolizumab \nbased on TMB status of  advanced solid tumors .179 The ORR in the \nTMB -H group was 29% and only 6% in the non -TMB -H group. Fifteen \npercent  of patients experienced an AE of grade 3 or higher, with colitis \nbeing most common. One treatment -related death due to pneumonia \nwas reported.  In addition to these trial results, small case reports have \nalso suggested that pembrolizumab is effective and well -tolerated as \nsubsequent -line therapy for metastatic penile cancer.180,181 A multicenter \nretrospective study of 92 patients with advanced or metastatic penile cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors reported a median OS \nof 9.8 months (95% CI, 7.7– 12.8 months) and a median PFS of 3.2 \nmonths (95% CI, 2.5– 4.2 months).\n182 For the full patient population in \nthe study, ORR was 13%, but raised to 35% in the 20 patients with \nlymph node -only metastases. The authors conclude that while the study \ndemonstrates that checkpoint inhibitors are active in a subset of patients with advanced penile cancer, further studies are needed to \ndefine which patients receive the most  benefit.  \nDue to the paucity  of data on subsequent -line systemic therapy  for \nmetastatic penile cancer, the NCCN Panel recommends a clinical trial \nor pembrolizumab  monotherapy  (if tumor is dMMR/MSI -H or TMB -H) as \npreferred treatment options in this setting.  Paclitaxel\n183 or cetuximab184 \nmay also be considered as subsequent -line treatment , especially if \nprevious treatments did not include a similar class of agent.

Accurate clinical staging allows for a \ncomprehensive treatment approach to be devised, thus optimizing \ntherapeutic efficacy and minimizing treatment -related morbidity. \nPrognostic factors help predic t if lymph node metastases are suspected \nin the absence of any palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy. When \nclinically indicated, an ILND has curative potential, particularly when \nperformed early, with contemporary surgical series demonstrating its \nreduced morbidity.  However, r ecurrent or metastatic disease still \nrepresents a major clinical challenge for SCC of the penis, thus, the Panel recommends participation in well -designed clinical trials when \napplicable and available to further advance the management of t his \ndisease.
