If persistently positive, proceed with resection or biopsy. (Also \nfor SEM-7)\nSEM-6\n• Preference for chemotherapy regimens removed from this page and directed to TEST-F.\n• Footnote nn added: Patients should wait at least 6 months post-chemotherapy to conceive a child or up to 2 years under extreme caution. While more \ndata is are needed in this space, the Panel believes these recommendations are currently well supported.Global Changes\n• Footnote modified: Mildly elevated, non-rising AFP levels may not indicate presence of germ cell tumor. Decisions to treat should not be based solely  \non AFP values <20 ng/mL. More highly elevated AFP levels generally indicate the presence of nonseminomatous tumor elements. Further workup \nshould be considered before initiating treatment for mildly elevated beta-hCG (generally <20 IU/L) since other factors, including hypogonadism and \nmarijuana  cannabis  use, can cause false-positive results. See Discussion.\n• CT/MRI recommendations updated throughout the guidelines as appropriate.MS-1\n• The discussion section has been updated to reflect the changes in the algorithm.Updates in Version 2.2025 of the NCCN Guidelines for Testicular Cancer from Version 1.2025 include:PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

Therefore, minimally invasive RPLND  is not recommended as standard management, but can be considered in highly  selected  \ncases at high-volume centers.\nTEST-I\n• Staging, bullet 1 modified: Abdomen/pelvis CT scan with contrast and chest x-ray or CT scan (or abdomen/pelvis MRI with and without contrast ) and \nchest x-ray are is recommended within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of chemotherapy , RPLND, or RT to confirm staging, even if scan was performed \npreviously (SEM-2 and NSEM-2).\n• Treatment response assessment, bullet 2, sub-bullet 1 modified: A negative FDG-PET/CT following chemotherapy is very reassuring. If FDG-PET/CT \nscan is positive, resection or interventional radiology-guided biopsy should be considered. An alternative is to wait an additional 8–12 weeks and repeat \nFDG-PET/CT scan imaging  to assess for changes. If the mass is persistently FDG-avid on PET,  positive  then resection or biopsy is recommended.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

References are provided to support current \nrecommended management.\n• The mean dose (Dmean) and dose delivered to 50% of the volume (D50%) of the kidneys, liver, and bowel are lower with CT-based \nanteroposterior-posteroanterior (AP-PA) three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) than intensity-modulated RT  (IMRT).1 As a result, the risk \nof second cancers arising in the kidneys, liver, or bowel may be lower with 3D-CRT than IMRT, and IMRT is not necessary.2 Proton therapy \ncan also be considered. See Discussion.\n• Timing of Radiotherapy:\n\u0017Radiotherapy should start once the orchiectomy wound has fully healed.\n\u0017Patients should be treated 5 days per week.\n\u0017Patients who miss a fraction should be treated with the same total dose and with the same fraction size, extending the overall treatment \ntime slightly.\n• Antiemetic medication significantly improves nausea. See  NCCN Guidelines for Antiemesis. Antiemetic prophylaxis is encouraged at least 2 \nhours prior to each treatment, and some cases may require more frequent dosing.\nPreparation for Radiotherapy\n• A discussion of semen analysis and sperm banking prior to post-orchiectomy treatment is recommended if clinically indicated.3,4 \n• If sperm banking is desired, it should be performed prior to the delivery of adjuvant therapy.\nGeneral Treatment Information\n• Treatment Planning Principles\n\u0017A non-contrast CT simulation should be performed with the patient supine, arms at the patient's sides, in the treatment position.\n ◊Immobilization with a cast may be used to improve the reproducibility of patient setup.\n ◊All patients, with the exception of those who have undergone bilateral orchiectomy, should be treated with a scrotal shield. \nStage I on TEST-C 2 of 5\nStage IIA/B on TEST-C 3 of 5\nReferences  on TEST-C 5 of 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

The weights \nof the fields may be equal.\n ◊Recent nodal mapping studies suggest that fields should target the retroperitoneal lymph nodes but not necessarily the ipsilateral renal \nhilar nodes (see Lateral borders).7,8\n ◊Superior and inferior borders: Borders may be determined by bony anatomy.\n ◊The superior border should be placed at the bottom of vertebral body T10/T11.9\n ◊The inferior border should be placed at the inferior border of vertebral body L5.6,10\n ◊Lateral borders:\n ▪Conventionally, para-aortic-strip fields are approximately 10 cm wide, encompassing the tips of the transverse processes of the PA \nvertebrae.\n ◊The location of the kidneys within the para-aortic-strip fields varies from patient to patient.\n ▪For patients whose kidneys are relatively medial, small renal blocks may be added at the level of T12. The right and left kidney D50% \nshould be ≤8 Gy (ie, no more than 50% of each kidney can receive ≥8 Gy).1 If only one kidney is present, the kidney D15% should be \n≤20 Gy (ie, no more than 15% of the volume of the kidney can receive ≥20 Gy).1\n ▪An alternative 3D-CRT planning technique is to base the lateral borders on vascular structures on a treatment planning CT scan \nwithout contrast. The aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC) may be contoured on the CT scan; one should allow a 1.2- to 1.9-cm margin \non the aorta and IVC to include the para-aortic, paracaval, interaortocaval, and preaortic nodes in the clinical target volume.7,11 \nThe planning target volume is then established by uniformly expanding the clinical target volume by 0.5 cm in all directions to \naccount for treatment setup errors.12 A uniform 0.7-cm margin should be provided on the planning target volume to the block edge to \ntake beam penumbra into account (Figure 1, see TEST-C 4 of 5).1\nSpecial Considerations\n• Ipsilateral pelvic surgery (eg, inguinal herniorrhaphy or orchiopexy) may alter the lymphatic drainage of the testis. As a result, irradiation of  \nthe ipsilateral iliac and inguinal lymph nodes, including the surgical scar from prior surgery, has been advocated even in patients with stage \nI cancer.8,13 PRINCIPLES OF RADIOTHERAPY FOR PURE TESTICULAR SEMINOMA\nStage IIA/B on TEST-C 3 of 5\nReferences  on TEST-C 5 of 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

There is no break between the two phases.\n• Modified Dog-Leg Fields:\n\u0017Dose:\n ◊The initial phase consists of treatment of modified dog-leg fields to 20–25.5 Gy (see Table 1 on TEST-C 2 of 5 for dose fractionation options).\n ◊Boost gross disease to achieve a total dose of approximately:\nTable 2: Boost to Gross Disease\nStage IIA/B Total Dose (Gy) Dose per Fraction (Gy)\n1–2 cm 30 1.8–2.0 Gy per fraction\n2–3 cm 36 1.8–2.0 Gy per fraction\n\u0017Target: The fields should include the retroperitoneal and proximal ipsilateral iliac lymph nodes.\n ◊Modified dog-leg fields as described by Classen et al are preferred.14\n ◊Care should be taken to ensure coverage of the ipsilateral common, external, and proximal internal iliac lymph nodes down to the top of \nthe acetabulum.\n ◊The fields can be set up using bony landmarks or by contouring the vascular structures, as for stage I.\n ▪The superior border should be placed at the bottom of vertebral body T10/T11.15\n ▪The inferior border should be placed at the top of the acetabulum.14\n ▪The medial border for the lower aspect of the modified dog-leg fields extends from the tip of the contralateral transverse process of \nthe fifth lumbar vertebra toward the medial border of the ipsilateral obturator foramen.\n ▪The lateral border for the lower aspect of the modified dog-leg fields is defined by a line from the tip of the ipsilateral transverse \nprocess of the fifth lumbar vertebra to the superolateral border of the ipsilateral acetabulum.\n ▪Preferably, one should contour the aorta and IVC from the bottom of the T10/T11 vertebra inferiorly and ipsilateral iliac arteries and \nveins down to the top of the acetabulum. One should provide a 1.2- to 1.9-cm margin on these vascular structures for the clinical \ntarget volume.7,11 The planning target volume is then established by uniformly expanding the clinical target volume by 0.5 cm in all \ndirections to account for treatment setup errors.12 A uniform 0.7-cm margin should be provided on the planning target volume to the \nblock edge to take beam penumbra into account (Figure 2, TEST-C 4 of 5).1\n ▪It is not necessary to include the ipsilateral inguinal nodes or the inguinal scar in the AP-PA fields unless the patient has a history of \nipsilateral pelvic surgery (eg, inguinal herniorrhaphy or orchiopexy).\n• Cone Down:\n\u0017Dose: The second phase (cone down) of the radiotherapy consists of daily 1.8–2 Gy fractions to a cumulative total dose of approximately  \n30 Gy (1–2 cm) for stage IIA and 36 Gy (2–3 cm) for stage IIB.14\n\u0017Target: The nodal mass (gross tumor volume) must be contoured.

Trans-scrotal \norchiectomy is discouraged as scrotal violation is associated with higher rates of local recurrence and altered pathways of metastatic \ndissemination.\n\u0017When a patient presents with a testicular mass, rapidly increasing beta-hCG or AFP, metastatic disease on imaging, and symptoms related \nto disseminated disease, chemotherapy can be initiated immediately without waiting for orchiectomy or a biopsy-proven histologic \ndiagnosis. However, radical inguinal orchiectomy should be performed at completion of chemotherapy.\nTestis-Sparing Surgery (TSS)\n• TSS, such as partial orchiectomy, can be considered in select patients with a testicular mass.\n\u0017Indications for TSS:\n ◊Synchronous bilateral germ cell tumors, a solitary testicle with a mass suspicious for germ cell tumor, or a functionally solitary testicle \nwith adequate gonadal function with respect to androgen production or sperm production (eg, history of contralateral testicular atrophy). \nThese patients should be counseled regarding the following:\n –High risk of local recurrence with TSS\n –Need for continued surveillance with testicular self-exam, physical exam by a physician, and/or ultrasound\n –Role of adjuvant radiation to reduce the risk of local recurrence\n –Impact of RT on sperm and testosterone production\n –Risk of testicular atrophy, need for testosterone replacement, and/or infertility\n\u0017Principles of TSS:\n ◊TSS should be performed through an inguinal approach.\n ◊Frozen section should be performed at the time of surgery by an experienced genitourinary pathologist.\n ◊Radical orchiectomy in the setting of a normal contralateral testicle is recommended if biopsy shows testicular cancer is present or there \nis suspicion of cancer.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

Therefore, minimally invasive RPLND can be considered in select cases at high-volume centers.\nPostchemotherapy Setting\n• Postchemotherapy RPLND is indicated in patients with metastatic NSGCT with a residual retroperitoneal mass following systemic \nchemotherapy and normalized postchemotherapy serum tumor markers. \n• A full bilateral template RPLND should be performed in all patients undergoing RPLND in the postchemotherapy setting, with the boundaries \nof dissection being the renal hilar vessels (superiorly), ureters (laterally), and the common iliac arteries (inferiorly). Completeness of \nresection is a consistent independent predictor of clinical outcome. In postchemotherapy RPLND, surgical margins should not be \ncompromised in an attempt to preserve ejaculation. Additional procedures and resection of adjacent structures may be required.\n\u0017Modified template RPLND may be an option in select patients with initial stage IIA/B disease within the primary landing zones.\n• Completeness of resection is a consistent independent predictor of clinical outcome. In postchemotherapy RPLND, surgical margins should \nnot be compromised in an attempt to preserve ejaculation.

If FDG-PET/CT scan is positive, resection or interventional radiology-\nguided biopsy should be considered. An alternative is to wait an additional 8–12 weeks and repeat imaging to assess for changes. If the \nmass is persistently positive then resection or biopsy is recommended.\nSurveillance\nPure Seminoma and Nonseminoma (TEST-A  and TEST-B)\n• MRI with and without contrast can be considered in place of an abdomen/pelvis CT.\n\u0017MRI protocol should include visualization of retroperitoneal and pelvic nodes.\n• Use the same imaging modality (CT or MRI) throughout surveillance.\n• In stage I seminoma and nonseminoma, chest x-rays should be obtained when abdomen/pelvis CT scans are performed.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nTesticular Cancer   \n \nMS-2 Overview \nTesticular cancer accounts for < 1% of new cancer cases  with a majority of \npatients being diagnosed between the ages of 20  and 34 years .1,2 The \nglobal  incidence of this disease has been steadily ri sing over the past \nseveral  decades  with a n estimated 9720 new cases of testicular cancer \nprojected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2025 .3-10 An estimated \n600 deaths  will occur from testicular cancer in the United States in 2025 , \nreflect ing the excellent 5 -year relative survival rate for this disease \n(~94%).2,3,11 Several risk factors for testicular cancer have been identified, \nincluding personal or family history of testicular cancer and \ncryptorchidism .4,12,13    \nGerm cell tumors (GCTs) comprise 95% of malignant tumors arising in the \ntestes  and are broadly  categorized into two main histologic subtypes: \nseminoma and nonseminoma.4,14,15 Seminomas and nonseminomas \ntypically occur at about the same rate, but nonseminomas tend to be more \naggressive and often include multiple cell types. When both seminoma and elements of nonseminoma are present, management follows that of a \nnonseminoma. The four types of nonseminomas are embryonal \ncarcinoma, choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma.\n14 Most \nnonseminomas are mixed tumors of these four subtypes. Teratomas can \nbe classified as either mature or immature, but this  does not affect \ntreatment in these patients. Rarely, a teratoma may contain elements of a \nsomatic cancer, such as a sarcoma or adenocarcinoma, and is then \nreferred to as a teratoma with somatic -type malignancy . Teratomas with \nsomatic -type malignancy are managed differently from other GCTs.  \nPrepubertal teratomas, which are biologically different from the much more \ncommon post -pubertal teratom as, are occasionally diagnosed in adults  \nand are less aggressive and managed differently.16,17  \nTogether, t hese guidelines pertain to  all stages  of testicular GCTs  and \nshould be closely followed to maximize the potential for cure and to avoid unnecessary side effects, complications, and late toxicities. It is important \nto note that pediatric GCTs are managed differently from adult GCTs and \nare not covered in these guidelines. T esticular tumors arising from the \nstroma  (eg, Leydig cell tumors and Sertoli cell tumors)  are also not \ncovered in these guidelines  as they account for <5% of cases  and have a \ndifferent biology and natural history .  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the development and update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at www.NCCN.org .  \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines \nin Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Testicular Cancer, an electronic \nsearch of the PubMed database was performed using the following search \nterms: ‘testicular cancer’ and ‘germ cell tumor .’ The PubMed database \nwas chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.  \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: \nClinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; \nGuideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta -Analysis; Systematic \nReviews; and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional \nsources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines and/or discussed by the \nPanel have been included in this version of the Discussion section (eg, e-\npublications ahead of print, meeting abstracts). Any recommendations for which high- level evidence is lacking are based on the P anel’s review of \nlower -level evidence and expert opinion.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nTesticular Cancer   \n \nMS-3 Sensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines® strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN \nGuidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully addr ess the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclus ive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nClinical Presentation, Workup , and Primary Treatment  \nClinical Presentation  \nTesticular cancer most often presents as a painless or painful testicular \nnodule, mass, enlargement, or induration (hardening). Often, patients will \npresent with testicular discomfort or swelling suggestive of epididymitis or \norchitis. A trial of antibiotics is never warranted in the treatment of  a mass \nsuspicious for GCT but  can be considered in patients with pain without a \nmass on further workup . Other patients may present with enlarged lymph \nnodes of the lower neck or upper chest (supraclavicular), a ret roperitoneal \nmass, gynecomastia, venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism.                                                                                                          Workup   \nIf testicular cancer is being considered as a possibility, then a transscrotal \nultrasound with Doppler should be performed. Testicular ultrasound can \nconfirm the presence of  a testicular mass, determine whether a mass is \nintra- or extratesticular, and explore the contralateral testis.18 Testicular \nGCTs  are typically heterogeneous,  hypoechoic , and vascular on \nultrasound. If the ultrasound findings show a mass suspicious  for \nmalignancy , then a  radical  inguinal orchiectomy is generally performed to \nmake a diagnosis. Testis -sparing surgery  (TSS)  (ie, partial orchiectomy) \nmay be considered in select patients  (See Principles of Surgery  for Germ \nCell Tumors  in the algorithm) . Unique clinical settings that warrant \nconsideration for TSS include synchronous bilateral tumors, a solitary \ntesticle  with a mass suspicious for GCT , or a functionally solitary testicle \nwith adequate gonadal function with respect to androgen production  or \nsperm production (eg, history of contralateral testicular atrophy) .19-21 \nTransscrotal biopsies of the testes should not be performed because \nviolating the scrotum  increases the risk of local or atypical regional \nrecurrence and can complicate management. In addition, a thorough history and physical examination should be performed. S erum tumor \nmarkers  (alpha- fetoprotein [AFP],  beta-human chorionic gonadotropin \n[beta-hCG], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH])  also need to be assessed \nboth before and after orchiectomy as they are used for prognosis and \nstaging (see Serum Tumor Markers  below) .\n15 Elevated levels of beta -hCG, \nLDH, or AFP should be followed up with repeated tests to allow for precise \nstaging. Given the higher rates of hypogonadism in the testicular cancer \npopulation, measuring baseline levels of gonadal function can also be \nconsidered.  It should be noted that in cases of advanced disease, \nsystemic therapy may be initiated if there is an unequivocable diagnosis of GCT with marker elevation or after percutaneous biopsy of a metastatic \nsite.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.  NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nTesticular Cancer   \n \nMS-4 Serum Tumor Markers   \nThe serum tumor markers , LDH, AFP, and beta- hCG, are used to aid in \ndetermining stage as well as  prognosis of testicular GCTs . AFP and beta -\nhCG are also used for assessing treatment outcomes. For risk \nstratification  in patients with metastatic disease , levels of AFP, beta- hCG, \nand LDH should all be measured on D ay 1 of cycle one of first -line \nchemotherapy. In addition, l evels of AFP and beta- hCG should be \ndetermined before and after treatment and throughout the follow -up \nperiod. Elevated markers after orchiectomy may be the only indication of \noccult metastatic disease (ie, in patients with stage IS disease), and \nelevated marker levels are often the earliest sign of relapse after treatment \nor during surveillance.  LDH is not generally used to monitor for relapse or \nresponse to treatment because false -positive elevations are common, but \nit is useful for risk stratification when starting first -line chemotherapy. \nWhen interpreting marker levels, caution should be taken when mild elevation of only one marker is observed due to the occurrence of false \nposit ives.  \nAFP is most associated with yolk sac tumors but can also be elevated in \npatients with embryonal carcinoma or teratoma. Seminomas do not \nproduce AFP ; thus, an elevated serum AFP can be diagnostic of a mixed \nGCT  (nonseminoma) in patients whose histology has been read as pure \nseminoma .\n22-25 Therefore, the diagnosis of a seminoma is restricted to \npure seminoma histology and normal serum AFP levels. However,  mildly \nelevated, non- rising levels of AFP do not always indicate the presence of a \nGCT as a small number of people have a chronically elevated serum AFP \nlevel and clinicians should be cautious  in interpreting mildly elevated but \nstable AFP.26 In general, AFP levels < 20 ng/mL should not be assumed to \nbe related to a GCT in a patient and should not be the sole basis for \ndecisions about treatment. If an elevat ed serum AFP is due to a metastatic \nnonseminomatous GCT, then the AFP typically will be steadily rising.  In addition, other tumors , such as hepatocellular carcinomas and gastric \ncarcinomas , can cause AFP elevation.  \nBeta-hCG is the most commonly elevated  serum tumor marker in \ntesticular cancer. Elevated serum concentrations of beta -hCG may be \npresent with both seminomatous and nonseminomatous tumors. However, \nin patients with seminoma with beta- hCG levels >1000 IU/L, the possibility \nof nonseminoma  should be considered  and the surgical specimen with \npathology  should be re -review ed. Referral to  a high- volume center \nexperienced in the treat ment of these patients is encouraged. Additionally, \npatients with post -orchiectomy beta- hCG levels >5000 IU/L should receive \na brain MRI since they are at an increased risk of having brain metastases. Further workup should be considered before initiating \ntreatment for mildly elevated beta- hCG (generally <20 IU/L), since other \nfactors such as hypogonadism, hyperthyroidism, and cannabis  use can \ncause elevations of beta -hCG.\n27-29 Intramuscular injection of 300 mg of \ntestosterone cypionate may be administered in cases of mild beta- hCG \nelevations of unclear etiology to exclude hypogonadism as a cause. \nElevated beta -hCG has also been reported in other tumors, such as \nlymphoma, bladder cancer, and adenocarcinomas, and is thus not specific for GCTs.\n30 Additionally, heterophile antibodies have been reported to \nresult in substantially elevated false- positive beta -hCG results (>400 IU/L); \ntherefore, clinicians should consider repeating the test using a different \nassay if a false positive is suspected due to the absence of radiographic \nevidence of disease.31-33 \nLDH is important for determining prognosis and is used to help risk  stratify \npatients starting first -line chemotherapy for disseminated \nnonseminomatous tumors.24 There are also data indicating that in patients \nreceiving chemotherapy for stage II or III seminoma, an elevation of LDH \n>2.5 times the upper limit of normal  (ULN)  is an adverse prognostic sign in \npatients with otherwise good- risk disease .34 While  serum LDH \nconcentrations are elevated in approximately 50%  of patients  with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nTesticular Cancer   \n \nMS-5 advanced testicular cancer, LDH is a less specific marker for testicular \ncancer compared to AFP and beta- hCG. Therefore, decisions regarding \ntreatment should not be made based on mildly elevated (< 2.5 times the \nULN) LDH alone.  \nPrimary Treatment   \nRadical inguinal orchiectomy is the primary treatment for most patients \nwho present with a testicular mass that is suspicious  for malignancy on \nultrasound.35 A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with contrast or MRI with \nand without contrast should be considered prior to orchiectomy  if they can \nbe done without delaying surgery  as postoperative changes can \noccasionally complicate the interpretation of scans completed after \norchiectomy. However, this is a minor concern and should not lead clinicians to delay orchiectomy . Concurrent insertion of testicular \nprosthesis may be considered during radical inguinal orchiectomy if \ndesired by the patient.\n36-38 In cases where the ultrasound shows an \nambiguous abnormality that is inconclusive for malignancy , an open \ninguinal biopsy ( TSS or partial orchiectomy) with intraoperative frozen \nsection analysis can be performed , but such cases are extremely rare.39 \nAdditionally, inguinal exploration of the contralateral testis  with direct \nobservation and partial orchiectomy can  be considered if a patient has \nbilateral testicular abnormalities  or if the testis is cryptorchid or shows \nmarked atrophy.40 However, biopsies are not recommended for testicular \nmicrocalcifications  alone .  \nSperm banking should be discussed with patients of reproductive age, if clinically indicated, before undergoing any therapeutic intervention that \nmay compromise fertility, including surgery, radiation therapy (RT), \nchemotherapy , or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection ( RPLND) .\n41-44 If \nsperm banking is desired, it  should be performed before orchiectomy in \npatients  with a single testicle, those undergoing bilateral orchiectomy, and \nthose with risk factors for infertility (atrophic contralateral testicle, history of \ninfertility).  Further disease management is dictated by histology, stage, and  whether \nthe cancer is a pure seminoma or a nonseminoma ( nonseminomas \ninclude mixed GCTs that are partially comprised of seminoma and tumors \nthat are histopathologically described as pure seminomas in patients with \npersistently elevated serum AFP). Alt hough rare, when a patient presents \nwith: 1) marke dly elevated beta-hCG or AFP levels; 2) a testicular mass \nand/or disease distribution typical for a testicular, retroperitoneal, or \nmediastinal GCT; and 3)  a clinical scenario where, due to the bulk , signs , \nor symptoms of disease, the risk of delaying systemic therapy outweighs \nthe benefit of a tissue diagnosis, chemotherapy may be initiated immediately without waiting for a biopsy diagnosis or performing \norchiectomy . Orchiectomy should be performed after completion of \nchemotherapy , oftentimes at the time of RPLND or other adjunctive \nsurgical procedures . \nStaging  \nStaging of testicular GCTs is based on determination of the extent of \ndisease and assessment of post -orchiectomy levels of serum tumor \nmarkers.15 The tumor (T), node (N), and metastasis (M) staging system \nused by the AJCC is the internationally accepted standard for cancer \nstaging and is a major factor influencing prognosis and treatment \ndecisions. The AJCC TNM staging system incorporates serum tumor \nmarker elevation as a distinct category (S), whic h is unique to this organ \nsite. The extent of the primary tumor is classified after orchiectomy;  \ntherefore , pathologic (p) staging is assigned to the primary tumor (T).  \nThe 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual introduced invasion of the epididymis and hilar soft tissue as new pathologic criteria used for T \nclassification of stage I testicular GCTs.\n15,45 Due to the excellent clinical \noutcomes seen in testicular cancer, large- scale follow- up studies have \nhistorically used tumor relapse rather than tumor -specific survival to \nvalidate the relevance of pathologic parameters used for staging.15 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

Current data only \nsupport their association with having advanced -stage disease at the time \nof diagnosis.46,47 Therefore, it is the opinion of the P anel that these factors \nshould not be used for clinical decision- making in the treat ment of these \npatients. Instead, the NCCN Guidelines  for Testicular Cancer recommend \ntreating patients with stage I nonseminoma based on the presence or \nabsence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), invasion of the spermatic cord, \nor invasion of the scrotum, which are risk factors known to be associated \nwith an increased risk of relapse.48-57 Predominance of embryonal \ncarcinoma has also been proposed as a prognostic indicator of relapse in \nstage I nonseminoma, with several studies showing that a high proportion  \nof embryonal carcinoma in the primary tumor (>50%) is associated with an increased risk of relapse.\n50,58- 65 However, very few patients have a high \nvolume of embryonal carcinoma without also having LVI, and the value of embryonal carcinoma predominance in predicting relapse in the absence \nof LVI is unclear.\n50,58,61,65 Therefore, predominance of embryonal \ncarcinoma is not used by the NCCN Guidelines for Testicular Cancer to \nrisk stratify patients with stage I nonseminoma. Patients with s tage I \nnonseminoma with a high volume of embryonal carcinoma and no \nevidence of LVI are neith er high risk nor low risk and c ould be considered \nfor adjuvant therapy. The NCCN Guidelines do not recommend risk -\nadapted treatment for stage I pure seminoma.  \nThe 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual also introduced changes to pathologic staging based on the type of  spermatic cord  \ninvolvement . Currently, continuous involvement of the spermatic cord soft \ntissue by the primary tumor is staged as pT3 , whereas discontinuous \nspermatic cord involvement  by invasion of lymphovascular spaces  is now \nconsidered as a metastatic deposit (pM1).\n15 This significant change  results \nin patients with discontinuous spermatic cord i nvolvement being upstaged \nfrom high risk stage I to stage III disease  independent of radiologic or serologic assessment , which the Panel is concerned may lead to \novertreatment. The evidence used to support  this change is  unclear ; \npresently,  there are no persuasive data showing differences in clinical \noutcomes between patients with discontinuous spe rmatic cord involvment \ncompared to patients  with continuous involvement.  A recent retrospective \nanalysis  assessing the impact of different patterns of spermatic cord \ninvolvement on clini cal stage and patient outcomes  found no significant \ndifference s in either clinical stage at presentation or risk of recurrence \nbased on t he type of spermatic cord involvement (continuou s vs. \ndiscontinuous).66 Therefore,  for management decisions, the Panel \nrecommends  staging GCTs with discontinuous invasion of the spermatic \ncord as pT3 (high- risk stage I) and not as pM1 (stage III) as is \nrecommended by the AJCC. If surveillance is elected as primary treat ment  \nfor such patients, clinicians should remember that there is  a higher risk of \npelvis relapses in these patients.     \nTo assess for metastatic disease, imaging studies of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed. Such studies typically include CT scans \nof the abdomen and pelvis and CT scan or x -ray of the chest. \nFluorodeoxyglucose (FDG )-PET scans should not be used to stage \ntesticular GCTs. In select patients, brain MRI should also be performed; \nthese patients include those with neurologic symptoms, post -orchiectomy \nserum beta -hCG >5000 IU/L, non -pulmonary visceral metastas es, or \nextensive lung metastases. In patients who had elevated serum tumor \nmarkers prior to orchiectomy, it is important to obtain the half -life kinetics \nof the tumor markers after orchiectomy if the markers are declining,  \nbecause a slower -than- expected decline often ind icates the presence of \nmetastatic disease.  \nIn 2016 , the World Health Organization (WHO)  tumor  classification \nscheme was significantly modified to contain new entities for GCTs.\n67 \nMajor changes include a pathogenetically derived classification using \ngerm cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) of the testis as the new WHO -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

Presently, \nreporting of anaplasia (seminoma or spermatocytic tumor) or distinguishing mature from immature teratoma is not required, since these \ndo not have demonstrable prognostic importance. Conversely, the \npresence of somatic -type malignancy  arising in teratomas  indicates more \naggressive behavior and  should therefore be reported.  \nRisk Classification for Advanced Disease  \nIn 1997,  the International Germ Cell Cancer Consensus Group (IGCCCG) \ndefined a classification system based on identification of clinically \nindependent prognostic features such as extent of disease and post -\norchiectomy levels of serum tumor markers. This classification system categorizes patients with testicular  GCTs into good- , intermediate -, or \npoor-risk groups.\n69 When determining a patient’s risk classification, the \nrelevant serum tumor marker value is the value on Day 1 of cycle one  of \nfirst-line chemotherapy. Definitions of stage and risk classification in these \nguidelines are done according to the IGCCCG classifications.   \nThe IGCCCG classification system plays a pivotal role in the management of metastatic GCTs but relies on old data of patients treated between 1975 \nand 1990. The IGCCCG Update Model, published in 2021, included data \nfrom 9728 males  with metastatic nonseminomatous GCTs  treated with \netoposide and cisplatin ( EP)-based first -line chemotherapy between 1990 \nand 2013 at institutions in Europe, North America, and Australia.70 \nCompared with the original IGCCCG publication, 5- year progression- free \nsurvival ( PFS) remained similar in patients with good or intermediate risk \n(89% vs . 90% and 75% vs . 78%, respectively), but the 5 -year overall \nsurvival (OS) increased from 92% to 96% in patients with good risk and from 80% to 89% in patients with  intermediate  risk. In patients with poor \nrisk, the 5 -year PFS increased from 41% to 54% and the OS from 48% to \n67%. Furthermore, a novel prognostic model for PFS was developed in \n3543 patients and validated in an independent dataset.  This more granular \nprognostic model identified a new cutoff of LDH at 2.5 times the  ULN, \nincreasing age, and presence of lung metastases as additional adverse prognostic factors. An online calculator is provided \n(\nhttps://www.eortc.org/IGCCCG- Update). It should be noted that patients \nwith good risk disseminated seminoma with an LDH >2.5 times the  ULN \nhave a worse prognosis than other patients with good risk. However, \ncurrently there are  insufficient data to recommend treating these patients \ndifferently based on LDH level  (see discussion below) .  \nPure Seminoma  \nIf a pure seminoma is detected , an abdomen/ pelvis CT scan  with contrast \nor MRI with and without contrast  should be performed unless performed \nprior to orchiectomy  to assess the retroperitoneal lymph nodes. A chest x -\nray is also recommended. A  chest CT is indicated if the abdomen /pelvis \nCT/MRI  or the chest x -ray shows evidence of metastatic disease. \nMeasurement of beta- hCG, LDH, and AFP levels should be repeated \nsince TNM staging is based on post-orchiectomy  levels. For patients with \nelevated pre -orchiectomy  beta-hCG levels, beta -hCG levels should be \nfollowed with repeated determinations after orchiectomy  to determine their \ntrajectory and, if declining, their nadir. The expected half -life for beta -hCG \nis ≤3 days. Beta -hCG and LDH may be elevated in patients with \nseminoma . Mild to moderate elevations of beta- hCG (S1) are not used to \nrisk stratify pure seminomas , but a level of 5000 IU/L, which is the cutoff \nfor S2, is not generally thought to be compatible with a pure seminoma. Therefore, patients with a histopathologic  diagnosis of pure seminoma and \na beta -hCG of ≥ 5000 would be treated as an intermediate- or poor -risk \nnonseminoma, depending on the extent of  beta-hCG levels .

For patients wit h \notherwise good -risk disseminated seminoma (stage II –III), an LDH >2.5 \ntimes the  ULN is associated with a worse prognosis , but there is no \nconsensus as to whether treatment for such patients should therefore be \nintensified.37 Some  Panel members  advocate treating them as other \npatients with good  risk while others  advocate a more aggressive approach  \n(such as three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin [ BEP]  plus a \nfourth cycle using EP) .  \nFor patients  with normal imaging (ie,  stage I), rising or persistently \nelevated beta- hCG levels general ly indicate the presence of metastatic \ndisease (stage IS). Beta-hCG levels >1000 IU/L post -orchiectomy may \nindicate the presence of nonseminomatous tumor elements.  An elevated \nAFP pre- or post -orchiectomy  indicates  the presence of  nonseminoma tous \nelements  unless another cause of the elevated AFP (such as liver \ndisease) is identified.  It should be noted that if mild elevations in AFP are \nobserved that are stable, patients can be treated as seminoma as this \ntypically does not connote nonseminoma.  Patients with seminoma arising \nfrom an extragonadal site, like  the mediastinum, are usually diagnosed via \nbiopsy and treated with standard chemotherapy regimens  (EP for 4 cycles \nor BEP for 3 cycles)  according to risk classification. B rain MRI is \nrecommended  if beta -hCG levels exceed 5000 IU/L (as noted above, a \nbeta- hCG >1000 IU/L is rare in seminoma and a value >5000 IU/L is \ngenerally indicative of a nonseminomatous GCT),  if there is extensive \nmetast atic disease in the lungs , or if non -pulmonary visceral metastases  \nor neurologic symptoms are present . Sperm banking should be \nrecommended , if clinically indicated , to patients who will be undergoing \nchemotherapy, RT, or RPLND  if they wish to preserve fertility . Pure Seminoma Stages IA and IB  \nPrimary Treatment for Pure Seminoma Stages IA and IB  \nSince  80% to 85% of  patients with stage I pure seminoma are cured by \norchiectomy alone, the NCCN P anel strongly prefers surveillance for pT1–\npT3 tumors  as the standard post -orchiectomy treatment option for these \npatients  due to the low risk of relapse, especially when considered in \nrelation to the potential harms of adjuvant therapy . For patients who \ndecline surveillance or for whom surveillance is not a reliably good option, \nthe Panel recommends  chemotherapy with one or two cycles of single-\nagent carboplatin (with imaging recommended within 4 weeks prior to \ninitiation, even if scans have been performed previously) , or RT (20 Gy \npreferred)  as alternative options to decrease the risk of relapse in certain \npatients . Disease -specific survival for stage I disease approaches 100%  \nirrespective of the management strategy used.71   \nSurveillance  \nSeveral studies evaluating surveillance for  the management of  stage  I \nseminoma have been conducted.72-77 The relapse rates seen in these \nstudies have ranged from 15% to 20%, with most disease relapse \ndetected in the i nfradiaphragmatic lymph nodes. The best established risk \nfactor for relapse of pure seminoma is larger  size of the primary tumor .78 \nAs the tumor size increases , the risk of relapse also increases, but any \ncutoff point is arbitrary.72,74,79- 82 Although the 8th edition of the AJCC \nCancer Staging Manual uses a cutoff point  of 3 cm to subclassify stage IA \npure seminoma  into pT1a and pT1b , this  small cutoff size wa s chosen in \nan effort to be conservative due to the large variability in size cutoffs \nreported in the literature.15 Additionally, some studies have reported that \nrete testis invasion is an independent risk factor for relapse in stage I pure \nseminoma while others have reported that it is not.72,74,78- 80,83 Due to these \nconcerns, the NCCN Panel discourages risk-adapted management in \nstage I pure seminoma and instead strongly recommends surveillance for PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

If \nsurveillance is not applicable, alternative options are either adjuvant \nchemotherapy with single- agent carboplatin or adjuvant RT as described \nbelow. Each approach has distinct advantages and disadvantages that should be discussed with patients and thei r families to select  the best \nindividual treatment  plan.  \nAdjuvant Chemotherapy  \nAs noted, chemotherapy or RT are potential therapeutic options for those \npatients with stage I seminoma for whom surveillance is not a suitable \noption. Oliver et al reported the initial results of a trial that randomized \n1477 patients with stage I seminoma to receive either RT (n = 885) or one  \ncycle of intravenous carboplatin (n = 560) at the dose area under the \ncurve ( AUC)  x 7 (ie , based on the formula 7 x [glomerular filtration rate \n(GFR, mL/min) + 25 mg]) .84 At a follow- up of 3 years, the relapse -free \nsurvival rates for both groups were  similar (95.9% for the RT group and \n94.8% for the carboplatin group), which established the noninferiority of \ncarboplatin compared to RT.84 The mature results of this trial confirmed \nthe noninferiority of single- dose carboplatin versus RT in terms of relapse-\nfree survival.85 In an intent -to-treat analysis, the relapse- free survival rates \nat 5 years were 96% in the RT arm and 94.7% in the carboplatin arm \n(hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; P = .37). One seminoma -related death occurred \nafter RT and none occurred after carboplatin. Additionally, patients given carboplatin were less lethargic and less likely to take time off from work \nthan patients receiving RT. Therefore, the authors concluded that a single dose of carboplatin is less toxic and as effective in preventing disease \nrelapse as adjuvant RT in patients  with stage I pure seminoma after \norchiectomy.\n85 However, it should be noted that there are limited long- term \nfollow- up data regarding the toxicity and efficacy of carboplatin.72,86 \nMoreover, a non-randomized population- based study of 897 patients with \nstage I seminoma suggested that patients with tumor size >4 cm , rete \ntestis invasion, or both derive a smaller reduction in relapse rate with one cycle of carboplatin than previously reported.72,74,86 After a median follow -\nup of 5.6 years, the relapse rate in patients with one or both risk factors was 15.5% for patients treated with surveillance versus 9.3% for patients \nwho received one cycle of carboplatin.\n72 Given the toxicity, a n absolute \nreduction in the risk of relapse by only 6.2% may not be sufficient to justify \nthe use of single- cycle adjuvant carboplatin.86 Platinum -based \nchemotherapy has also been associated with cardiac toxicity and an \nincreased risk for secondary cancers  as well as a 23% higher risk of death \nfrom causes other than testis cancer .87-90 However, most of the data on \nlate effects of platinum -based chemotherapy in survivors of testis cancer is \nderived from those receiving multi -agent cisplatin- based chemotherapy ; \nthus, whether such long- term risks ensue from single- agent carboplatin as \ndosed for stage I seminoma remains unknown. Therefore, more data are \nneeded to assess the value of one cycle of  carboplatin in treating patients \nwith stage I seminoma.   \nUse of two cycles of adjuvant carboplatin in this setting has also been \nstudied. The Spanish Germ Cell Cancer Cooperative Group reported that \namong 412 males  treated with two cycles of adjuvant carboplatin for high-\nrisk stage I seminoma, the 10- year relapse- free survival rate was 97% and \n10-year OS was 100%.91-93 The efficacy of two cycles of adjuvant \ncarboplatin was confirmed in a study by the Hellenic Cooperative \nOncology Group, which reported a 5 -year relapse -free survival rate of \n96.8% among 138 patients with stage I seminoma treated with this regimen.\n94 Additionally, a  prospective study reported the treatment \noutcomes of 725 patients with stage I seminoma treated with surveillance, \none cycle of carboplatin, or two cycles of carboplatin.95 Although disease-\nspecific survival was 100% for all three strategies, crude relapse rates \nwere significantly higher with the one- cycle regimen (5%) compared to the \ntwo-cycle regimen (1.5%) after a median follow -up of 30 months. \nFurthermore, one cycle of carboplatin demonstrated low efficacy to control \nlarge tumor s.

Regardless of the regimen \nused, imaging is recommended within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of \nchemotherapy to confirm staging, even if scans were previously performed.  \nAdjuvant Radiation Therapy  \nNumerous studies  have found an increased risk for late toxicities  in \npatients with seminoma treated with RT, including development of \nsecondary malignancies  and an increased risk of death from causes other \nthan testis cancer.90,96,97 A population- based study  of over 5700 survivors \nof testis cancer, including 1500 treated with RT,  reported that RT for stage \nI seminoma was associated with a 28 % increase in the risk of death from \nnon-testis cancer -related causes .90 The increased risk of death was seen \nspecifically for secondary malignancies and diseases of the digestive \nsystem. However, most of these patients were treated with larger \ntreatment fields and higher radiation doses  than currently recommended \nfor stage I seminoma. Another population- based study reported that RT for \nstage I seminoma was associated with an 80% increase in the risk of \ndeath from secondary cancers.98 Similarly, it has been reported  that \nmoderate- dose infradiaphragmatic RT for stage I seminoma was \nassociated with an increased risk for secondary cancers in organs within \nthe radiation field.99 Another  multicenter cohort study  also reached similar \nconclusions .89 Additionally, one study reported that RT might increase the \nrisk of a subsequent cardiac event,87 but other analyses have not \nconfirmed this risk.98  \nNodal mapping studies suggest that treatment fields  for RT should target \nthe retroperitoneal lymph nodes but not necessarily the ipsilateral renal hilar nodes.\n100,101 Special circumstances, such as ipsilateral pelvi s surgery, \nmay alter the lymphatic drainage of the testis. Therefore, irradiation of the \nipsilateral iliac and inguinal lymph nodes has been advocated in  such patients.100,102,103 It should be noted that patients treated with para- aortic \nRT have a slightly higher rate of pelvi s relapse compared with those \ntreated with “dog -leg’’ RT.103- 106 Prophylaxis to the mediastinum is not \nprovided, because relapse rarely occurs at this site and mediastinal \nradiotherapy introduces additional toxicities and late effects .  \nThe NCCN Panel prefers surveillance to the routine use of adjuvant \ntherapy for patients with stage I seminoma because the risk of relapse is \nlow when considered in relation to the potential harms of adjuvant therapy.  \nHowever, if adjuvant RT is delivered, the P anel recommends a total dose \nof 20 Gy be administered in 10 fractions of 2.0 Gy each.107 Alternatively, a \ntotal dose of 25.5 Gy can be given in 17 fractions of 1.5 Gy each.108 Other \nRT dose schedules are listed in Table  1 in Principles of Radiotherapy for \nPure Testicular Seminoma in the algorithm . Patients at higher risk for \nmorbidity from RT, such as those with a history of inflammatory bowel disease or prior RT, are generally not given primary RT.   \nFollow -up for Pure Seminoma Stages IA and IB After Primary Treatment  \nAlthough no single follow -up plan is applicable to all patients, the NCCN \nPanel has provided guidance for the follow -up of patients with testicular \nGCTs for the first 5 years after the completion of therapy . These \nrecommendations may be individualized and extended beyond 5 years at \nthe discretion of the physician. Follow -up strategies for patients with stage \nI seminoma vary according to the treatment modality received by the \npatient (surveillance vs. adjuvant t reatment ). An analysis of >5000 patients \nwith stage I seminoma from various trials reported that the 5 -year relapse \nrate was higher with surveillance (18.6%) compared to RT (4.8% with \nextended- field RT and 3.6% with para -aortic RT) or chemotherapy (6.1% \nwith one cycle of carboplatin and 2.3% with two cycles of carboplatin).105 \nAn analysis of data from the Danish Testicular Cancer database reached \nsimilar conclusions , reporting that the 10- year cumulative incidence of \ndisease recurrence was 32% for patients with high- risk (tumor size ≥6 cm) PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

However, in this study, surveillance was defined as not having \nundergone radiation or chemotherapy, meaning that no distinction was \nmade between patients who underwent surveillance and patients who \nnever followed up. Thus, patients for whom active treatment was \nrecommended but who never came in for treatment  would have been \nconsidered to have undergone surveillance even if they never had any \nsurveillance visits or tests. Independent of the treatment  modality  received \nby the patient , the risk of relapse is highest in the first 2 years following \ntreatment.105 In the event of relapse, clinicians should keep in mind the \npotential for development of a second primary tumor in the contralateral \ntestis. Reassessment  of disease activity should be performed in patients \nwith new or worsening signs or symptoms of disease, and patients experiencing relapse should be treated according to the extent of the \ndisease. However, patients should not be treated based upon an elevated \nLDH alone for reasons discussed previously. Additionally, t hose previously \non surveillance can be treated with RT or chemotherapy , depending on \nextent of disease,  and those who previously  received carboplatin or RT \ncan be treated with first -line cispla tin-based chemotherapy (see First -Line \nChemotherapy Regimens for Germ Cell Tumors   in the algorithm ).  \nFollow -up During Surveillance \nFollow -up for patients with stage I seminoma treated with surveillance \nafter orchiectomy  is outlined in Table 1 on TEST- A 1 of 3  in the algorithm \nand includes a history and physical examination with optional \nmeasurement of serum tumor markers . The measurement of serum tumor markers is optional due to the rarity of marker -only relapse, since most \npatients with elevated markers will also have evidence of relapse on \nimaging. Additionally, in one of the largest prospectively maintained \ndatabases of patients wit h stage I seminoma treated with surveillance, it \nwas reported that routine measurement of serum tumor markers did not aid in the early diagnosis of relapse.\n111 Therefore, routine measurement of \nserum tumor markers can be safely omitted from stage I seminoma \nsurveillance schedules.       \nThere is controversy regarding how many imaging studies should be \nperformed in patients on  surveillance. A phase III clinical trial in the United \nKingdom entitled TRISST (MRC TE24/T rial of Imaging and Schedule in \nSeminoma Testis) investigated whether MRI or a reduced CT schedule \ncould be used as a safe and effective alternative to standard CT -based \nsurveillance in the management of stage I seminoma.112 The trial \nrandomized 669 patients with stage I seminoma post -orchiectomy to \nreceive 7 CTs, 7 MRIs,  3 CTs , or 3 MRIs at selected intervals. After a \nmedian follow -up of 72 months, 12% of patients had relapsed.  In all \ngroups, most relapses were detected at scheduled imaging with very few occurring beyond 3 years. Relapse treatment outcomes were good, with \n81% of patients experiencing a complete response with no tumor -related \ndeaths.

Other \nstudies have reported similar results, calling into question the value of \nchest x -rays in surveillance settings for stage I seminomatous GCTs.113,115 \nTherefore, routine chest imaging, including chest x -ray and chest CT with \ncontrast, should be reserved for patients with thoracic symptoms.  \nFollow -up After Adjuvant Treatment  \nFollow -up of patients treated with adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or RT) \nis outlined in Table 2 on TEST- A 1 of 3  in the algorithm and includes a \nhistory and physical examination with testicular ultrasound performed for \nany equivocal exam , with optional measurement of post -orchiectomy \nserum tumor markers. A meta -analysis of 2466 patients reported that \nrelapse rarely occurred > 3 years after treatment with RT or carboplatin \n(0.2% of patients).71 Since the rate of relapse beyond 3 years is very low \nfor patients treated wit h chemotherapy or RT, the NCCN P anel \nrecommends performing an abdom en/pelvis CT scan or MRI  with or \nwithout contrast annually for the first 3 years  only. The MRI protocol \nshould include visualization of the retroperitoneal and pelvi s nodes. Chest \nx-rays should be obtained only when clinically indicated,  and chest CT \nscans with contrast should be considered for patients who are  \nsymptomatic. CT is not recommended beyond 5 years, unl ess clinically \nindicated. Relapses are treated according to the stage at relapse.71 \nHowever, patients should not be treated based on an elevated LDH level \nalone.  \nPure Seminoma Stage IS  \nPrimary Treatment for Pure Seminoma Stage IS  \nStage IS pure seminoma is very uncommon and requires persistent elevation of serum tumor markers following orchiectomy  in the absence of \nradiologic evidence of metastatic disease . Elevated tumor markers \nincrease the risk of disease outside the retroperitoneum ; therefore , systemic therapy should be encouraged  (see First-Line Chemotherapy \nRegimens for Germ Cell Tumors  in the algorithm) . However, physicians \nare cautioned against treating a patient based on mildly elevated LDH or \nbeta- hCG alone, as other causes may be responsible for elevation of \nthese markers. Persistent and progressive elevation of serum markers , \nnotably beta -hCG, is usually evidence of metastatic disease, which will \nshow up radiographically if doubt exists in the diagnosis.  \nFollow -up for Pure Seminoma Stage IS  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends repeating measurements of serum tumor \nmarkers and performing imaging studies (chest/ abdom en/pelvis CT with \ncontrast  or MRI with and without contrast ) to scan for evaluable disease.  \nPure Seminoma Stages IIA and IIB  \nPrimary Treatment for Pure Seminoma Stages IIA and IIB  \nStage IIA pure seminoma is defined as metastatic disease to lymph \nnodes, with a lymph node mass measuring ≤ 2 cm in greatest diameter.15 A \nlymph node mass measuring 2 to 5 cm in greatest diameter is classified as \nstage IIB disease.15 Clinically, patients are often categorized as having \n“non-bulky ” clinical stage II disease  (largest node <3 cm o n the transaxial \nlong axis ) or “bulky” clinical stage II disease (largest node >3 cm on the  \ntransaxial  long axis) . Providers should engage in shared decision- making \nfor stage IIA seminoma that includes informing patients of the recurrence \nrates and potential for dual therapy with each treatment option.  More over, \nto confirm staging before  initiating  treatment in select cases of stage IIA \ndisease with borderline retroperitoneal lymph nodes, waiting 4  to 8 weeks \nafter initial imaging assessment and repeating imaging (CT or MRI)  may \nbe considered.  \nOptions for the primary treatment of stage IIA and IIB seminomas  are \nbased on lymph node mass measurements  with the options for non-bulky \nclinical stage II disease  being RT first-line chemotherapy with three  cycles PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

However, a bleomycin -free regimen should be considered in \npatients at risk for bleomycin -related toxicity, such as those with reduced \nGFR  or older age (age >50) . The p resence of  chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease (COPD) or other lung disease resulting in reduced \npulmonary function are also risk factors for bleomycin- related toxicity . \nDifferent studies have reported different outcomes with regard to whether \nchemotherapy or RT is more effective in this setting. A  study that  used \ndata from the National Cancer Database to assess survival outcomes \naccording to treatment strategy in patients  with stage IIA/B seminoma \nshowed that when RT  was compared  with multi- agent chemotherapy in \n1772 patients with stage IIA –C seminoma treated with orchiectomy , 5-year \nOS was significantly higher with RT compared to chemotherapy in patients with stage IIA seminoma (99% vs. 93%; HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.09– 0.86;  P = \n.027)  after a median follow -up of 65 months .\n119 Conversely , in this study, \nno significant difference in 5- year OS was seen in patients with stage IIB \nseminoma  treated with post -orchiectomy RT or chemotherapy (95.2% vs. \n92.4%). A similar study by Paly et al , which also evaluated data from the \nsame database during the same time period,  reached similar conclusions  \nwith r eceipt of chemotherapy being associated with decreased 5- year OS \nin patients with stage IIA seminoma  (HR, 13.33; P  < .01), but not in \npatients with stage IIB seminoma (HR, 1.39; P  = .45) .120 However, t hese \nstudies were not randomized trials and treatment decisions were based on \nthe treating physician’s clinical judgment, which presumably was \ninfluenced by the specific characteristics of each patient. Therefore, it is \npossible that patients with more ext ensive disease were selected for \nchemotherapy. Nevertheless, these studies provide some support for the \nuse of RT over chemotherapy to treat stage IIA seminoma. In contrast, a \nstudy by Mortensen et al evaluating 363 patients with stage II –III \nseminoma reported that the relapse rate was 6% among patients treated with chemotherapy compared to 12.6% among those treated with RT. It \nshould be noted that chemotherapy was used for more advanced stage \ndisease than RT in this study.82 This has led some physicians to prefer \nchemotherapy for patients with stage II  seminoma ; however, these results \nmust be interpreted with caution since this study was not a randomized \ntrial and did not specifically compare the two treatment modalities for \nstage IIA disease. Therefore, th e Panel  recommend s first-line \nchemotherapy as a primary treatment  option for both stage IIA and IIB \nseminoma  but suggests that  RT should be reserved for select patients \nwith non- bulky ( <3 cm  in transaxial long axis ) disease.116 \nThe target fields f or RT for stage IIA/B disease should include the para -\naortic  and proximal ipsilateral iliac lymph nodes. Treatment is delivered in \ntwo consecutive anteroposterior -posteroanterior  (AP/PA) phases with no \nbreak in between. The initial phase consists of treatment of modified dog -\nleg fields at a dose of 20 Gy delivered in 10 fractions of 2.0 Gy each or \n25.5 Gy delivered in 17  fractions of 1.5 Gy each. The P anel prefers \nmodified dog-leg fields as described by Classen et al.116 The second \nphase (cone down) consists of daily 1.8-  to 2-Gy fractions to a cumulative \ntotal dose of 30 Gy for patients with stage IIA seminoma and 36 Gy for \npatients with stage IIB seminoma.116 Prophylactic mediastinal RT is not \nindicated for the management of stage II disease.121 For details on field \narrangement, see Principles of Radiotherapy for Pure Testicular \nSeminoma in the algorithm.  \nAlthough primary treatment with RT or first -line chemotherapy results in \nfavorable survival outcomes, they bear the risks of acute and late toxic \neffects.  Therefore, evaluation and development of alternative strategies is \nof interest in order to  mitigate toxicity while maintaining efficacy. \nProspective and retrospective studies have reported the use of primary \nRPLND in clinical stage II seminoma with curative intent and \ndemonstrated that RPLND can cure many clinical stage II seminomas  with \na 2-year recurrence -free survival of 72% to 90 %, allowing patients to avoid PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

However, for stage IIB \nnon-bulky disease (2– 3 cm) this is a category 2B recommendation as \nsome Panel members expressed concern  regarding the  potential for \nhigher disease recurrence rates in these patients as compared to \nchemotherapy along with the  limited number of patient s with this extent of \ndisease included in these trials . RPLND is not recommended for bulky (>3 \ncm) stage IIB disease due to very limited data for those patients and the \nhigher relapse rates observed with increasing node size.  Referral to a \nhigh- volume center with extensive experience in the performance of this \nprocedure is recommended.  \nFurthermore , the recent  single -arm phase II SAKK (01/10) trial \ninvestigated whether one cycle of single- agent carboplatin followed by \ninvolved- node RT was effective in treating patients with stage IIA or IIB \nseminoma (N = 116) with minimal toxicity.126 After a median follow -up of \n4.5 years, the 3-year PFS was 93.7% , which was short of the target 3- year \nPFS of 95%. Although the study did not  meet its primary endpoint, survival \nwas favorable and toxic effects were minimal with this treatment strategy. \nGrade 3– 4 treatment -related adverse events included neutropenia, \nthrombocytopenia,  and vomiting,  which occurred in 4%, 3% , and 1% of \npatients, respectively. No treatment -related deaths and no late toxic \neffects were reported. Serious adverse events were reported in only 4% of patients. Based on the promising efficacy of the regimen presented in this \ntrial, the Panel has added this regimen as an  option for patients with \ninvolved lymph nodes measuring <3 cm. However, due to the lack of \nevaluation of late toxicities beyond 3 years , this is included as a category \n2B option for this patient population.

All stage IIC and stage III seminomas are \nconsidered good risk except for stage IIIC disease, which involves non-\npulmonary visceral metastases (eg, bone, liv er, brain) and is considered \nintermediate risk. Stage IIIB does not apply to pure seminomas.  Standard \nfirst-line chemotherapy is used for both groups of patients.  \nFor patients with good  risk, three  cycles of BEP or four cycles of EP are \nrecommended (both preferred).127- 129 The two regimens have not been \ncompared head- to-head in patients with seminoma, so the P anel \nrecommends  that a number of factors be considered in choosing between \nthe two. The specific schedule of the two regimens is different (9 weeks  for \nthree  cycles of BEP  compared to 12 weeks for four cycles of EP),  which  \nmay make one more convenient for certain patients. While e toposide and \ncisplatin are associated with a dose -dependent increased risk of \nsecondary  cancers , there are no data addressing whether the risk is \nsignificantly higher with four cycles than with three. Bleomycin, which  is \ncleared by the kidneys, is associated with a risk of pneumonitis and \ndiminished pulmonary function. Therefore, f our cycles of EP are  generally \npreferable in patients with a reduced GFR (who would be expected to \nclear bleomycin more slowly), in patients > 50 years  of age (since  renal function decreases with age), and in patients with COPD or other lung disease resulting in significantly diminished pulmonary function. Some \noncologists prefer four  cycles of EP  for patients who smoke  heavily  \nregardless of lung function. The different risks associated with each \nregimen may lead individual patients to prefer one regimen over the other. \nThe physician and patient should make a shared decision informed by \npatient clinical characteristics and preferences.  Intensification of therapy \nshould be considered for patients with good risk disease and an LDH >2.5 \ntimes the ULN.\n \nFor patients with intermediate- risk disease,  more intensive chemotherapy \nwith four cycles of BEP (preferred) or four cycles of etoposide, mesna, \nifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP) is recommended.130- 135 VIP should be \nreserved for patients with a contraindication to bleomycin (ie, a reduced or \nborderline GFR , aged >50 years , COPD , or other lung disease) , but it \nshould be kept in mind that this regimen is high risk for febrile neutropenia and granulocyte colony -stimulating factors (G -CSFs) should be used ( see \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors  at \nwww.NCCN.org ). All of these chemotherapy options are category 1 \nrecommendations except for VIP, which is a category 2A recommendation.  \nManagement of Pure Seminoma Stages IIA, IIB, IIC, and III After \nChemotherapy  \nAfter primary treatment with first-line chemotherapy, patients with stage \nIIA, IIB, IIC, or III seminoma should be evaluated by CT scan with contrast  \nor MRI with and without contrast  of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as well \nas measurement of serum tumor markers. Patients with normal serum \nAFP and beta -hCG levels and either no residual mass or a residual mass \n≤3 cm should undergo surveillance.

If the \nFDG -PET/CT is negative  or indeterminate , surveillance is recommended. \nIf results are positive, imaging can be repeated in 6 to 8 weeks  or \nresection or interventional radiology (IR) -guided biopsy of the residual \nmass should be performed.  If imaging was repeated and the results are \npersistently positive, proceeding with resection or biopsy is recommended. \nFor patients with a positive FDG -PET/CT, referral to a high- volume center \nshould also be considered.  \nIf the residual disease is completely resected and histopathology  show s \nviable seminoma, two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered  \nwith the following regimens: EP, TIP (paclitaxel, ifosfamide, cisplatin),144 \nVIP, or VeIP (vinblastine, mesna, ifosfamide, cisplatin).145,146 If the resection is incomplete and the pathology shows viable seminoma, or  if \nthere is progressive disease (growing mass or rising markers), a full \ncourse of second- line chemotherapy ( four cycles of TIP or four cycles of \nVeIP; both preferred) is recommended.144- 147 More information on second-\nline therapy can be found later in this discussion.  In rare cases, \nnonseminomatous elements may be identified in the biopsy specimen. If these elements are non- teratomatous, then management should proceed \nin the same fashion as for viable seminoma. Following adjuvant or second- line chemotherapy, patients should undergo follow -up as \ndiscussed in the upcoming sections . Patients should also adhere to this \nfollow- up schedule if their biopsy results are negative for viable seminoma.  \nFollow -up for Pure Seminoma  Bulky Stage II B, IIC, and Stage III After \nChemotherapy  \nThe recommended follow -up schedule for patients with bulky clinical stage \nIIB, IIC , or stage III seminoma after treatment with chemotherapy is \noutlined in Table 6  on TEST- A 3 of 3 in the algorithm and includes more \nfrequent  history and physical examination as well as optional \nmeasurement of serum tumor marker levels. Abdom en/pelvis CT scans \nwith contrast  or MRI with and without contrast  are recommended, and t he \nMRI protocol should include all nodes  that need to be assessed. CT or \nMRI is not recommended beyond 5 years unless clinically indicated. Chest \nx-ray is recommended for routine follow -up; however,  chest CT with \ncontrast is preferred for patients with thoracic symptoms  or residual \nmasses or nodules in the chest . A chest CT with contrast should also be \nadded in years 1 and 2 along with chest x -ray if supradiaphragmatic \ndisease is present at diagnosis.  Patients with residual masses may require \nmore frequent imaging based on clinical judgment. A n FDG -PET/CT scan \nof the skull base to mid- thigh can be conducted if clinically indicated.

To assess for metastatic \ndisease, a CT scan  with contrast  or MRI with and without contrast of the \nchest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed unless performed prior to \norchiectomy . Use of FDG -PET/CT scan is not clinically indicated for \nnonseminoma.149,150 In select patients, brain MRI should also be \nperformed; these patients include those with neurologic symptoms, post -\norchiectomy serum beta- hCG >5000 IU/L or AFP > 10,000 ng/mL, \npredominance of choriocarcinoma, non-pulmonary visceral metastasis , or \nextensive lung metastases. Elevated levels of serum beta- hCG, LDH, or \nAFP should be followed up with repeated tests  as TNM staging is based \non post -orchiectomy values . In patients who had elevated serum tumor \nmarkers prior to orchiectomy, it is important to obtain the half -life kinetics \nof the tumor markers after orchiectomy if the markers are declining, \nbecause a slower -than- expected decline often indicates the presence of \nmetastatic disease. The NCCN Panel emphasizes that mildly elevated, \nnon-rising AFP levels ma y not indicate the presence of a GCT and that \ndecisions to treat should not be based solely on AFP levels < 20 ng/mL. \nSimilarly, further workup should be considered before initiating treatment \nfor mildly elevated beta -hCG (generally <20 IU/L)  as other facto rs such as \nhypogonadism and cannabis  use can cause false -positive results . \nElevations of AFP either pre-  or post -orchiectomy indicate the presence of \nnonseminomatous elements. For patients with elevated beta- hCG levels  \npre-orchiectomy , beta -hCG levels should be followed with repeated \ndeterminations after orchiectomy  to determine their trajectory and, if \ndeclining, their nadir. The expected half -life for beta- hCG is ≤3 days. For patients  with normal imaging (ie, stage I), rising or persistently elevated \nbeta- hCG levels generally indicate the presence of metastatic disease \n(stage IS). For patients with metastatic disease to the retroperitoneum or \nbeyond (stage II and III), highly elevated beta -hCG levels (>1000 IU/L)  \nmay indicate the presence of non- seminomatous tumor elements.  Sperm \nbanking should be recommended to pat ients of reproductive age, if \nclinically indicated, before undergoing any therapeutic intervention that \nmay compromise fertility.41-44  \n It should be noted that the Panel recommends staging tumors with \ndiscontinuous invasions of the spermatic cord as pT3 (high -risk stage I) \nand not as M1 (stage III) as is recommended in the 8th edition of the \nAJCC Cancer Staging Manual. It is critical to remember that risk of \nrelapse to the pelvis is higher in these patients; thus, the pelvis should \nbe included in imaging. Additionally, if  a patient presents with mediastinal \nprimary nonseminoma, this is considered poor -risk disease and should \nbe treated wit h either VIP or BEP along with careful pulmonary \nfunctioning monitoring.151  \nNonseminoma Stage I With and Without Risk Factors  \nPrimary Treatment for Nonseminoma Stage I With and Without Risk \nFactors  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends treating patients with stage I \nnonseminoma based on the presence or absence of risk factors known \nto be associated with an increased risk of relapse (LVI, invasion of the \nspermatic cord, or invasion of the scrotum).48-56 Some centers also \nconsider predominance of embryonal carcinoma as an additional risk \nfactor for relapse. However, r egardless of risk factors, patients with stage \nI nonseminoma with normal post -orchiectomy serum AFP and beta- hCG \nlevels  have three management options  for primary treatment  after \norchiectomy: surveillance,53,61,152,153 nerve -sparing RPLND,154 or adjuvant  \nchemotherapy with one cycle of BEP .155,156 The major difference in the PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nTesticular Cancer   \n \nMS-18 treatment of patients at low risk and high  risk is that surveillance is \npreferred for patients with stage I nonseminoma without risk factors , as it \nhas been shown that the presence of  risk factors, such as LVI, is a \nsignificant predictor of relapse when orchiectomy is followed by \nsurveillance alone ,35 whereas all three management options should be \ncarefully considered when risk factors are present . It should be noted \nthat surveillance or RPLND are also recommended options for  patient s \nwith stage I pure teratoma and normal markers. The survival rate s for \nstage I nonseminoma managed with surveillance,  nerve- sparing RPLND , \nor one cycle of BEP chemotherapy  exceed  98%. However, the high \nsurvival rate associated with surveillance depends on adherence to \nperiodic follow -up examinations and subsequent chemother apy for the \n20% to 30% of patients who relapse. Therefore, patients who choose \nsurveillance should adhere to the follow -up schedule.  \nIf nerve -sparing RPLND is chosen as primary treatment , it should be \ndone within 4 weeks of a CT or MRI and within 2 weeks  of repeat serum \nmarker testing to ensure accurate presurgical staging.157 A template \ndissection or nerve- sparing approach to minimize the risk of ejaculatory \ndisorders should be considered in patients undergoing primary RPLND \nfor stage I nonseminoma. The “split and roll” technique in which lumbar \nvessels are identified and sequentially ligated allows resection of all \nlymphatic tissue around and behind the great vessels (ie, aorta, inferior \nvena cava ) and minimizes the risk of an in -field recurrence.  Limited data \nsuggest increased frequency of aberrant recurrences with the use of  \nminimally invasive laparoscopic or robotic approaches to RPLND. A \nrecent case study of recurrence patterns in patients following robotic \nRPLND found that recurrences were highly variable, were in unusual \nlocations, and were associated with a high treatmen t burden.158 \nHowever, two retrospective reviews on robotic RPLND done at experienced centers showed that this technique can be performed safely \nwith low complication rates and similar oncologic outcomes to an open approach.\n159,160 Therefore, minimally invasive RPLND is not currently \nrecommended as standard management, but can be considered in highly selected cases . Referral to a high-volume center  is recommended for \npatients undergoing RPLND .  For patients electing one cycle of BEP, \nimaging  is also recommended within 4 weeks prior to the initiation of \nchemotherapy to confirm staging, even if scans were done previously.  In \na prospective trial by SWENOTECA, patients with stage I  nonseminoma \nwith or without LVI received one course of adjuvant BEP.\n156 The relapse \nrate at 5 years was 3.2% for patients with LVI and 1.6% for patients \nwithout LVI. Five -year OS was 100% in both groups.48 The results after a \nmedian follow -up of 7.9 years confirmed the low relapse rate with one \ncourse of adjuvant BEP, especially in patients with LVI.48 Several other \nstudies using two cycles of BEP as primary treatment for patients with \nstage I nonseminoma have similarly reported relapse- free survival rates \nof >95%.153,161- 165 However, late consequences of cisplatin -based \nchemotherapy, such as hearing damage and loss, cardiovascular \nconditions, hypertension, and neuropathy, have been reported during \nlong- term follow -up.166- 174 Therefore, one cycle of BEP is recommended \ndue to its lower toxicity.  \nFollow -up for Nonseminoma Stage I With and Without Risk Factors   \nThere is no single follow -up plan that is appropriate for patients with \nnonseminoma ; however, the Panel has provided guidance for the first 5 \nyears after completion of therapy. Modifications for individual patients \nbased on the biology of the disease as well as the length of time on \ntreatment should be considered along with an extension beyond 5 years at \nthe discretion of the treating physician. Follow -up strategies for stage I \nnonseminoma are dependent on the presence or absence of risk factors \nas well as the treatment modality received.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nTesticular Cancer   \n \nMS-19 Follow -Up During Surveillance \nLong-term follow- up for patients with stage I nonseminoma without risk \nfactors  and for those with risk factors are outlined in Table 7 and 8 on \nTEST -B 1 of 3 in the algorithm. Both include a history and physical \nexamination, serum tumor marker assessment, abdom en/pelvi s CT scan  \nwith contrast or MRI with and without contrast , and chest x -ray at different \nintervals . These tests are more frequent in patients with risk factors . The \nMRI protocol should include visualization of the retroperitoneal and pelvis \nnodes  as well as all other nodes that need to be assessed. Chest CT with \ncontrast is preferred over chest x -ray in the presence of thoracic \nsymptoms for patients regardless of treatment type as routine chest x -ray \nmay have limited value for detecting relapse in patients with stage I \nnonseminoma. In a recent retrospective study, a total of 76 relapses were \ndetected among 561 patients with stage I nonseminoma treated  with \nsurveillance following orchiectomy.114 All relapses were detected by either \nrising serum tumor markers and/or abnormal routine follow -up CT scans; \nno single relapse was detected by chest x -ray alone. Similar results have \nbeen reported in other studies, calling into question the value of chest x -\nrays in surveillance settings for stage I nonseminomatous GCTs.61,115,175  \nFollow -Up After 1 Cycle of Adjuvant BEP or Primary RPLND  \nFollow -up of patients treated with either 1 cycle of adjuvant BEP or with \nprimary RPLND is outline d in Table 9 on TEST- B 2 of 3 in the algorithm \nand includes history and physical examination with testicular ultrasound for any equivocal exam, evaluation of serum makers, CT/MRI of the \nabdomen and pelvis, and a chest x -ray. While the chest x -ray can be used \nfor routine follow -up, chest CT with contrast is preferred in patients with \nthoracic symptoms.  \nNonseminoma Stage IS  \nPatients with stage IS nonseminoma exhibit highly elevated or persistent ly \nrising  serum tumor markers post -orchiectomy, but no radiographic evidence of disease. However, mildly elevated levels of AFP or beta -hCG \nafter orchiectomy must be interpreted with caution. Mildly elevated, non-\nrising AFP levels (<20 ng/mL) may not indicate the presence of a GCT \nand should not be used to guide treatment decisions. In addition, \nhyperthyroidism, cannabis  use, hypogonadism, and heterophile antibodies \ncan result in significant elevations of beta -hCG.\n27-29,31,32 Elevated beta-\nhCG due to metastatic disease typically rises steadily on serial \nmeasurements. In patients with mildly elevated but stable beta- hCG and \nno other evidence of metastatic disease, repeating the test using a different assay should be considered.  Furthermore, many different \nconditions can result in an elevation of LDH, including many benign conditions. Therefore, patients should not be treated with chemotherapy \nfor systemic disease if the only evidence of systemic disease is an \nelevation of LDH.  \nPrimary Treatment for Nonseminoma Stage IS  \nThe NCCN Panel recommends that patients with stage IS nonseminoma \nbe treated with first-line chemotherapy  (see First-Line Chemotherapy \nRegimens for Germ Cell Tumors [TEST -E] in the algorithm)  if the elevated \nmarker is AFP or beta -hCG. For the purposes of this guideline, the NCCN \nPanel assumes that patients with stage IS disease have markers in the S1 \nrange. It would be extraordinarily rare for a patient to have an AFP >1000 \nng/mL or a beta- hCG >5000 IU/L and yet have no evidence of metastatic \ndisease on imaging studies. These guidelines cannot address every \npossible situation, and the treat ment of those rare patients with T any, N0, \nM0, S2 –3 disease should be individualized; referral to  a high- volume \ncenter is recommended. The vast majority of patients with stage IS have \nserum tumor markers in the S1 range, and they should receive first-line \nchemotherapy for good -risk disease: either three  cycles of BEP or four \ncycles of EP (both preferred). Both regimens are category 1 \nrecommendations, and either is preferable to initial RPLND as these \npatients nearly always have disseminated disease.176,177  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nTesticular Cancer   \n \nMS-20 Management of Nonseminoma Stage IS After Primary Treatment  \nThe treatment of patients with stage IS nonseminoma after primary \ntreatment with chemotherapy is described below in Advanced Metastatic \nNonseminoma (see Management of Good- , Intermediate- , and Poor -Risk \nNonseminoma After Chemotherapy ). \nNonseminoma Stage IIA  and IIB  \nPrimary Treatment for Nonseminoma Stage IIA  \nPrimary treatment for patients with stage IIA nonseminoma depends on \npost-orchiectomy serum tumor marker levels . For patients with normal \npost-orchiectomy levels of AFP and beta -hCG, the NCCN Panel \nrecommends either nerve- sparing RPLND or chemotherapy with three \ncycles of BEP or four cycles of EP as primary treatment options (both BEP \nand EP are preferred regimens).178,179 Chemotherapy is considered \nparticularly appropriate if the patient has multifocal disease. R PLND is \npreferred as primary treatment for stage II tumors with somatic type \nmalignancy (previously referred to as transformed teratoma).  Referral to a \nhigh- volume center is recommended for those patients who  undergo \nnerve- sparing RPLND. For patients with stage IIA seminoma with \npersistently elevated AFP and/or beta- hCG levels, the NCCN Panel \nrecommends first-line chemotherapy with three cycles of BEP or four  \ncycles of EP (both category 1; both preferred).154,180 For more information \non these regimens, see Primary Treatment for Good- Risk Nonseminoma \nbelow. A bleomycin- free regimen should be given to  patients at higher risk \nfor bleomycin- related complications ( eg, patients  aged >50 years , those \nwith diminished renal function, those with underlying lung disease) . It \nshould be noted that for select cases of clinical stage IIA disease with borderline retroperitoneal lymph nodes, waiting 4 to 8 weeks and \nrepeating imaging to confirm staging before initiating treatment can be considered.  Primary Treatment for Nonseminoma Stage IIB  \nPrimary treatment for patients with stage IIB nonseminoma also depends \non post -orchiectomy tumor marker levels a s well as on  radiographic \nfindings. When tumor marker levels are normal, the CT/MRI  findings \ndetermine the proper course of treatment. If abnormal radiographic \nfindings are limited to lymph node metastases within lymphatic drainage \nsites in the retroperitoneum (ie, the landing zone), patients may receive \nfirst-line chemotherapy with either three cycles of BEP or four cycles of EP \n(both preferred) or primary nerve -sparing RPLND (reserved for highly \nselected cases; ie, stage II tumors with teratoma predominance in patients \nwith normal markers). RPLND is also recommended for stage II tumors \nwith somatic type malignancy (previously referred to as trans formed \nteratoma). Referral to a high- volume center is recommended for nerve -\nsparing RPLND. Both options of first -line chemotherapy or primary nerve-\nsparing RPLND are comparable in terms of outcome, but side effects and toxicity are different.\n179 The reported relapse- free survival with either \napproach is close to 98%.181- 185 If metastatic disease (based on \nradiographic findings) is not confined to within the lymphatic drainage sites \n(ie, multifocal or symptomatic lymph node metastases with aberrant \nlymphatic drainage sites), first-line chemotherapy (three cycles of BEP or \nfour cycles of EP; both preferred) is recommended.  For patients with stage \nIIB nonseminoma with persistent marker elevation, the recommended \ntreatment option is also first -line chemotherapy with either three cycles of \nBEP or four cycles of EP  (both category 1 ; both preferred).  For more \ninformation on these regimens, see Primary Treatment for Good- Risk \nNonseminoma below.  A bleomycin- free regimen should be given to \npatients at higher risk for bleomycin- related complications (ie, patients \naged >50 years, those with diminished renal function, and those with \nunderlying lung disease).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nTesticular Cancer   \n \nMS-21 Management of Nonseminoma Stage I A, IB  With and Without Risk Factors , \nIIA, IIB  Treated with Primary Nerve- Sparing  RPLND \nTreatment options following primary nerve -sparing RPLND include either \nsurveillance or chemotherapy, depending on the number of positive lymph \nnodes identified. Since RPLND is likely a curative procedure in patients \nwith pN0 disease, surveillance is recomm ended for this group. \nSurveillance is also the preferred option for patients with pN1 disease, although chemotherapy with two cycles of EP can also be \nconsidered.\n154,186 The risk of relapse in clinical stage IIA nonseminoma \npatients with pN2 or pN3 disease after RPLND is >50%.154,184 This risk is \nreduced to < 1% with two cycles of adjuvant cisplatin- based \nchemotherapy.154,181,183 Therefore, the NCCN Panel prefers two cycles of \nadjuvant chemotherapy with EP to surveillance for pN2 disease  and \nrecommends either 2  to 3 cycles of BEP or 2  to 4 cycles of EP  for pN3 \ndisease. As pN3 disease is a rare circumstance, the Panel could not reach \na consensus as to the optimal regimen due to the limited data available. Surveillance may also be an option for patients with pN2 and pN3 disease \nand, if chosen  for pN3 dis ease, a CT/MRI of the abdomen/pelvis or a \nchest x -ray should be conducted 2  to 3 months post -RPLND.\n187 \nSurveillance is preferred for patients with pure teratoma.  \nFollow -up for Pathologic Stage IIA/B/C Nonseminoma  Undergoing \nSurveillance After Primary RPLND and Treated with Adjuvant \nChemotherapy  \nFollow -up for patients after RPLND and adjuvant chemotherapy  is outline d \nin Table 11 on TEST- B 3 of 3 in the algorithm and  consists of  a medical \nhistory  and physical examination, serum tumor marker assessment, CT \nwith contrast or MRI with and without contrast of the abdomen/pelvis, and \nchest x -ray. The MRI protocol should include visualization of the \nretroperitoneal and pelvi s nodes  as well as all other nodes that need to be \nassessed . Chest CT with contrast is preferred over chest x -ray in the \npresence of t horacic  symp toms . It should be noted that patients who undergo RPLND and are found to have pN0 disease or pN1 pure teratoma \nneed only 1 CT scan at postoperative month 3 to 4 and then as clinically \nindicated.  \nFollow -up for Pathologic Stage IIA/B Nonseminoma  Undergoing \nSurveillance After Primary RPLND and NOT Treated with Adjuvant \nChemotherapy  \nFollow -up for patients after RPLND and adjuvant chemotherapy is outlined \nin Table 12 on TEST- B 3 of 3 in the algorithm and consists of a medical \nhistory and physical examination, serum tumor marker assessment, CT \nwith contrast or MRI with and without contrast of the abdomen/pelvis, and \nchest x -ray. There is an increase in frequency of these tests as compared \nto the schedule for patients who received adjuva nt chemotherapy due to \nthe increase in relapse rates.188 The MRI protocol should include \nvisualization of the retroperitoneal and pelvis nodes  as well as all other \nnodes that need to be assessed. Chest CT with contrast is preferred over \nchest x -ray in the presence of thoracic  symp toms. It should be noted that  \nin patients who have pathologic stage IIC disease, more frequent imaging \nis recommended.  \nManagement of Nonseminoma Stage IIA and IIB Treated with First -Line \nChemotherapy  \nSubsequent management after first -line chemotherapy depends on the \nsize of the residual mass on CT or MRI . Patients should thus undergo \nabdom en/pelvis CT scan with contrast  or MRI with and without contrast  \nwithin 1 month of  completing chemotherapy; c hest CT, MRI, or chest x -ray \nmay also be considered.  FDG -PET/CT scan is not clinically indicated for \nnonseminoma.  Masses should be measured along the transaxial long axis \n(not the craniocaudal axis). If markers are negative and the residual mass \nis ≥1 cm after chemotherapy, nerve- sparing bilateral R PLND is \nrecommended  within 4 weeks of CT/MRI and within 2 weeks of \nconfirmation of normal tumor markers .

The rationale for this \nextended region of dissection is the greater likelihood of bilateral disease \nwith greater tumor burden.188 Modified template RPLND may be an option \nin select patients with initial stage IIA/B disease within the primary landing \nzones. The major morbidity associated with bilateral RPLND is retrograde \nejaculation, resulting in infertility. Nerve- sparing dissection techniques \npreserve antegrade ejaculation in 90% of cases.189 Therefore, nerve-\nsparing RPLND is recommended. For patients with negative markers and  \nno residual mass or a residual mass < 1 cm, surveillance is recommended; \nnerve- sparing bilateral RPLND is a category 2B recommendation in this \nsetting and may be performed in selected cases , including in patients with \nsubcentimeter residual nodes who have teratoma or yolk sac tumor in their \nprimary tumors . Referral to a high- volume center is recommended for \nsurgical resection of masses post -chemotherapy. If only necrotic d ebris or \nteratoma is present in the resected tissue, the patient should be put under \nsurveillance. If embryonal, yolk sac, choriocarcinoma, or seminoma \nelements are found in the residual mass, then two cycles of chemotherapy \nwith either TIP, VIP, VelP , or EP  is preferred. Surveillance could be \nconsidered as a reasonable alternative to chemotherapy for patients with \nresidual masses that have been completely resected if all the residual \nmasses have <10% viable cancer cells in the resected tissue.  \nFollow -up for Nonseminoma Stage II –III Surveillance After Chemotherapy \nWith or W ithout Surgery   \nThe 5-year follow- up for patients with stage II –III nonseminoma  treated \nwith chemotherapy with or without RPLND can be found in Table 10 on TEST -B 2 of 3 in the algorithm and includes history and physical \nexaminations, serum tumor marker assessment s, chest x- rays, and \nabdom en/pelvis CT scan s with contrast . An MRI with and without can be \nconsidered to replace an abdom en/pelvis CT with the protocol including  \nvisualization of the retroperitoneal and pelvis nodes. Chest x -ray may be \nused for routine follow -up, but chest CT with contrast is preferred in patients with thoracic symptoms.  Annual measurement of serum tumor \nmarkers can be considered for years 5 through 10 following complete \nresponse to first -line chemotherapy in patients with  metastatic  disease.\n190 \nAdditionally, patients with clinical stage II disease treated with \nchemotherapy who undergo postchemotherapy RPLND and are found to \nhave pN0 disease or pN1 pure teratoma need only 1 CT scan at \npostoperative month 3 or 4 and then as clinically indicated while patients \nwho only have a partial response to chemotherapy who are not surgical candidates may require more frequent imaging.  \nAdvanced Metastatic Nonseminoma  \nThe first-line chemotherapy  options for patients with advanced metastatic \nnonseminoma are based on the IGCCCG risk classification, which \ncategorizes patients as good, intermediate, or poor risk based on \nidentification of clinically independent prognostic features  such as extent \nof disease and post -orchiectomy levels of serum tumor markers .\n69 When \ndetermining a patient’s risk classification, the relevant serum tumor marker \nvalue is the value on D ay 1 of cycle one  of first -line chemotherapy.   \nPrimary Treatment for Good -Risk Nonseminoma \nThe IGCCCG good -risk group includes patients with stages IS, IIA (S1), \nIIB (S1), IIC, and IIIA disease. The treatment goal for good -risk disease is \nto limit toxicity while maintaining maximal efficacy. Presently, two \nregimens are recommended by the NCCN Panel: three  cycles of \nBEP127,129,191 or four cycles of EP128,129,191 (both category 1; both preferred).  \nBoth regimens are well tolerated and cure approximately 90% of patients \nwith good- risk disease.191,192 The only trial that directly compar ed these \ntwo regimens found no statistically significant difference in OS (96% in the \nBEP x 3 arm vs. 92% in the EP x 4 arm; P  = .096) or event -free survival  \n(91% with BEP x 3 vs . 86% with EP x 4; P  = .135).191 Factors that should \nbe considered when choosing between three  cycles of BEP and four \ncycles of EP include t he duration of treatment (9 weeks compared to 12 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

The physician and patient should make a \nshared informed decision based on  patient clinical characteristics and \npreferences. A bleomycin- free regimen should be given to patients at \nhigher risk for bleomycin- related complications (ie, patients aged >50 \nyears, those with diminished renal function, those with underlying lung \ndisease).  Some oncologists prefer four cycles of EP  for patients who \nsmoke heav ily regardless of lung function.  \nPrimary Treatment for Intermediate -Risk (Stage IIIB) Nonseminoma  \nFor patients with intermediate- risk disease, the cure rate is approximately \n70% with the standard chemotherapy regimen of four cycles of BEP.193,194 \nTherefore, the NCCN Panel recommends four  cycles of BEP  (preferred),  \nor four  cycles of VIP193,195 for patients who are at higher risk for  bleomycin -\nrelated complications, for the treatment of intermediate- risk (stage IIIB) \nnonseminoma. Both regimens are category 1 recommendations. However, \nif intermediate -risk status is based solely on LDH levels 1.5 to 3 × ULN, \nthen three  cycles of BEP or four cycles of EP196 can be considered.  \nPrimary Treatment for Poor -Risk (Stage IIIC) Nonseminoma  \nThe standard chemotherapy regimen for poor- risk disease is four cycles of \nBEP (preferred). Alternatively, four  cycles of VIP can be used to treat \npatients who are at higher risk for bleomycin- related complications .195 Both \nregimens are category 1 recommendations. However, <50% of patients \nwith poor -risk nonseminoma experience a durable complete response to \nfour cycles of BEP, and up to 50% die of their disease.69,197 Therefore, \nreferral to  a high- volume center is recommended  for the treat ment of \npatients with poor-risk nonseminoma .192 It should be noted that, while a \nrare circumstance, patients with poor -risk disease with choriocarcinoma -\npredominant histology, very high beta- hCG, and large lung or brain \nmetastases may experience hemorrhaging after initiation of chemotherapy. These patients should be more closely monitored and may require more support.  \nA randomized phase II trial compared the efficacy of four  cycles of BEP to \na more intensive regimen ( carboplatin, bleomycin, vincristine, and \ncisplatin/BEP [CBOP/BEP])  in 89 patients with poor -risk nonseminoma .198 \nAt a median follow -up of 63 months, 3- year PFS was 56% for CBOP/BEP \nand 39% for BEP (HR, 0.59; P  = .079). Three -year OS was 65% and 59%, \nrespectively (HR, 0.79; P  = .49), and there were no differences in toxicity \nbetween arms. The CBOP/BEP met response targets (74% complete \nresponse or partial response with negative markers) and warrants further \nstudy in a phase III trial.  \nManagement of Good -, Intermediate- , and Poor -Risk Nonseminoma After \nChemotherapy   \nAt the conclusion of first-line chemotherapy, chest/ abdomen /pelvis CT \nscan with contrast /MRI with and without contrast  and measurement of \nserum tumor marker levels are indicated to assess treatment response. \nFDG -PET scan has no role in assessing treatment response and residual \nmasses following chemotherapy in patients with nonseminoma. If no mass  \nor a residual mass <1 cm on the transaxial long axis  is found by \nradiographic imaging and the tumor marker levels are normal, the P anel \nrecommends surveillance. Nerve -sparing bilateral RPLND can be \nconsidered in select cases for patients w ith disease that is any T, N1– 3, \nand M0– 1 as well as in patients with subcentimeter residual nodes who \nhave teratoma or yolk sac tumor in their primary tumor  (category 2B).199 \nRPLND is recommended within 4 weeks of the CT scan and 2 weeks  of \nmarker measurement. Referral to high- volume centers is recommended  \nfor surgical resection of residual masses following chemotherapy.  \nIf there is a partial radiographic response to chemotherapy (as indicated \nby the presence of residual masses) and tumor marker levels are normal, \nthen surgical resection of all residual masses is recommended.200- 203 As PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

If only necrotic debris or \nteratoma is present in the resected tissue, the patient should be put under \nsurveillance. If embryonal, yolk sac, choriocarcinoma, or seminoma \nelements are found in the residual mass, then two cycles of chemotherapy \nwith either EP, TIP, VIP, or VelP should be administered. All regimens are preferred in this setting, although EP should be considered for patients \nwith low -volume residual disease.  If there is a teratoma with somatic -type \nmalignancy, consider histology -directed therapy and referral to a high-\nvolume center . Surveillance can also be considered for patients  with \nresidual masses that have been completely resected if all the residual \nmasses have <10% viable tumor cells in the resected tissue.  \nFurther treatment for patients who experience a partial radiographic \nresponse to chemotherapy (residual masses) with abnormal tumor marker \nlevels is guided by the kinetics of the tumor markers. If tumor marker \nlevels are elevated and persistently rising, the P anel recommends a full \ncourse of second- line chemotherapy (see Second- Line Therapy below). \nBrain imaging and testicular ultrasound should be considered in patients \nwith elevated or rising markers following first -line or second -line \nchemotherapy to eval uate for occult brain metastases or contralateral \nprimary disease. Patients with elevated but stable marker levels should be \nclosely surveilled. Patients with mildly elevated and normalizing markers should be considered for surgical resection of residual masses with \nsubsequent post -surgical treatment as discussed above. The P anel \nrecommends referral to a high- volume center for the treat ment of patients \nwith a partial response to first -line chemotherapy and abnormal marker \nlevels.    \nFollow -up for Good -, Intermediate -, and Poor -Risk Nonseminoma  \nThe 5-year follow- up for patients with good- , intermediate- , and poor -risk \nnonseminoma after chemotherapy (with or without post -chemotherapy RPLND) includes history and physical examination, serum tumor marker assessment, chest x -ray, and abdom en/pelvis CT with contrast or MRI  \nwith and without contrast . The frequency of these tests is outlined in Table \n10 on TEST- B 2 of 3 in the algorithm . Annual measurement of serum \ntumor markers can be considered for years 5 through 10 and as clinically \nindicated thereafter  following complete response to first-line chemotherapy \nin patients with metastatic disease.\n190 Patients who have an incomplete \nresponse to chemotherapy require more frequent imaging than is outlined \nin the table. Patients who undergo RPLND and are found to have pN0 \ndisease or pN1 pure teratoma need only one CT scan at postoperative \nmonths  3 to 4 and then as clinically indicated. T he MRI protocol should \ninclude all the nodes that need to be assessed , and c hest x -ray may be \nused for routine follow -up. However, a  chest CT with contrast is preferred \nin patients with thoracic symptoms , and a chest CT with contrast should \nbe performed at baseline if supradiaphragmatic disease is present .  \nSecond- Line and Subsequent Therapy for Metastatic \nGerm Cell Tumors \nSecond -Line Therapy  \nPatients with disease relapse following first -line therapy, or those who do \nnot experience a durable complete response to first -line therapy, should \nreceive second -line therapy. Patients with recurrent disease who have not \nbeen treated with prior chemotherapy should be treated per their risk \nstatus, as described in the preceding sections.  Additionally, if a patient \nreceived prior adjuvant therapy (ie,  one cycle of BEP only), first -line \nchemotherapy as previously discussed is recommended.  It is preferred by \nthe Panel that patients with recurrent  seminoma or  nonseminoma be \ntreated at centers with expertise in the management of this disease.  \nSperm banking is also recommended if not already performed.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nTesticular Cancer   \n \nMS-25 patients with relapsed seminoma or early relapses (within ≤ 2 years  of the \ncompletion of primary therapy)  of nonseminoma include enrollment in a \nclinical trial (preferred), conventional -dose chemotherapy , or high- dose \nchemotherapy. If chemotherapy is given, the conventional -dose regimens  \nthat are preferred in this setting are TIP or VeIP , both of which are high \nrisk for febrile neutropenia so G -CSFs should be used.144,204 -206 The \npreferred high- dose regimens include high -dose carboplatin plus \netoposide followed by peripheral blood stem cell i nfusion,207 or paclitaxel \nplus ifosfamide followed by high- dose carboplatin plus etoposide with stem \ncell support.208 Alternatively, surgery  may be considered for nonseminoma  \nif the recurrent mass is in a solitary resectable site and markers are \nnormal or only mildly elevated.209 Late relapses  of nonseminoma  (>2 years \nafter completion of first-line therapy) occur in 2 % to 3% of testicular cancer \nsurvivors.210,211 The Panel prefers surgical trea tment  for these patients, if \nthe recurrent mass is resectable, regardless of marker levels .209 Clinical \ntrial enrollment  or chemotherapy (conventional -dose or high- dose  using \nthe same regimens noted above) are  options  for patients with \nunresectable late relapses.  \nAn ongoing,  randomized, international , phase III trial (TIGER) will compare \nsecond- line conventional -dose chemotherapy with high- dose \nchemotherapy in patients with relapsed GCTs.212 The foundation of the \nTIGER trial was formed based on the results of a large retrospective \nanalysis by Lorch et al , which demonstrated the superiority of carboplatin-\nbased high- dose chemotherapy compared to cisplatin- based conventional -\ndose chemotherapy with respect to 2- year PFS (50% vs. 28%; P  < .001) \nand 5- year OS (53% vs. 41% ; P < .001).213,214 The TIGER trial will \nrandomize patients with unequivocal disease progression following \ncisplatin -based first-line chemotherapy to receive conventional -dose TIP \nor high- dose paclitaxel plus ifosfamide followed by high- dose carboplatin \nplus etoposide with stem cell support. OS is the primary endpoint. \nSecondary endpoints include PFS, response rate, toxicity, quality of life, and biological correlates.212,213 This trial has completed patient  recruit ment \nand results are expected sometime in the near future (Clinical Trial ID: \nNCT02375204).   \nManagement of Metastatic Germ Cell Tumors After Second -Line Therapy    \nTo assess response after second -line therapy, a CT scan with contrast  or \nMRI with and without contrast  of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and any \nother sites of disease is recommended. FDG -PET/CT scan has no role in \nassessing treatment response and residual masses following \nchemotherapy in patients with nonseminoma  but could be considered in \nassessing treatment response and residual masses following chemotherapy in patients with seminoma . Levels of serum tumor markers \nshould also be measured. For patients with seminoma, follow -up is similar \nto post first -line chemotherapy treatment  discussed above. Patients with  \nnonseminoma that demonstrate a complete response to second -line \ntherapy with normal marker levels should be put under surveillance. \nAlternatively, select patients  with nonseminoma may receive nerve -\nsparing bi lateral RPLND (category 2B), followed by surveillance. Referral \nto a high- volume center is recommended for nerve- sparing RPLND. For \npatients with nonseminoma and a partial response to second- line therapy \n(as indicated by residual masses on CT scan) and normal marker levels, \nsurgical resection of all residual masses is recommended followed by \nsurveillance.  If there is a teratoma with somatic -type malignancy, consider \nhistology -directed therapy and referral to a high- volume center . Patients \nwith a partial res ponse to second- line therapy (residual masses) and \nabnormal marker levels should be treated according to the kinetics of the \ntumor markers. If tumor marker levels are elevated and persistently rising, \nthe Panel recommends third- line therapy (see Third- Line Therapy below). \nPatients with elevated but stable tumor marker levels should be closely \nsurveilled. Patients with mildly elevated and normalizing markers should \nbe considered for surgical resection of residual masses followed by PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

Referral to high- volume centers is recommended for surgical \nresection of residual masses following chemotherapy.  \nThird -Line Therapy  \nThird- line therapy is recommended for patients with progressive disease \n(growing mass or rising markers) or recurrent disease following second-\nline therapy . Participation in a clinical trial is the preferred treatment option \nfor patients who experience relapse and have received prior high- dose \nchemotherapy . Alternatively, for patients previously treated with \nconventional -dose chemotherapy , high- dose regimens  are preferred.   For \nthose patients with seminoma, c onventional -dose third -line chemotherapy \ncan be considered regardless of previous treatment and RT  can be \nconsidered in select patients. Alternative options for patients  with \nnonseminoma  previously treated with either high-dose or conventional -\ndose regimens also includes surgical treatment  (if solitary resectable site) . \nMolecular testing , including microsatellite instability/mismatch repair \n(MSI/MMR) or tum or mutational  burden (TMB) testing,  is also \nrecommended  to determine eligibility for pan -cancer , tumor -agnostic  \nbiomarker -directed therapies . The preferred treatment option for patients  \nwith nonseminoma who experience a late relapse (>2 years after \ncompletion of second- line therapy) is surgery  if the recurrent mass is \nresectable. Conventional -dose or high- dose chemotherapy (if not \npreviously received) are also options for patients with late relapse.  \nIn order to maintain optimal efficacy and limit treatment -related toxicities, \nthe chemotherapy regimens previously received by the patient should be \nconsidered when deciding on third- line therapy options. High- dose \nchemotherapy is the preferred third -line option if it has not been previously \nreceived. If high- dose chemotherapy was previously received by the \npatient, then palliative chemotherapy is the preferred third-line treatment \noption. Additionally, the Panel considers pembrolizumab immunotherapy \nto be useful in certain circumstances (ie, in patients with MSI -high/ MMR -deficient  [MSI-H/dMMR]  or TMB -high [TMB -H, ≥10 mutations/megabase]  \ntumors  as determined by a validated and /or U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration [ FDA]-approved comprehensive genomic profiling [ CGP ] \nassay ).215- 218  \nThe recommended third- line palliative chemotherapy options for patients \nwith intensively pretreated, cisplatin- resistant, or refractory GCTs are \ncombinations of gemcitabine with paclitaxel and/or oxaliplatin,219- 225 or oral \netoposide.226 The recommendation for gemcitabine and oxaliplatin \n(GEMOX) is based on data from phase II studies investigating the efficacy \nand toxicity of GEMOX in patients with relapsed or cisplatin- resistant \nGCTs.220,222,224 These studies showed that GEMOX is safe for patients \nwith cisplatin -resistant testicular GCTs and may offer a chance of \nlong- term survival.220,222,224 Gemcitabine plus paclitaxel is another option \nthat has shown promising results in a phase II study.221 Follow -up results \nshowed long- term DFS in patients who progressed after high- dose \nchemotherapy and had not received prior paclitaxel or gemcitabine.223 A \nphase II study of patients with treatment -resistant GCTs also found the \ncombination of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and paclitaxel to be effective with \nacceptable toxicity.219 The overall response rate was 51% with 5% of \npatients achieving a complete response. A second study reported similar results.\n225 Additionally, high- dose single- agent oral etoposide was shown \nto be effective in a phase II study involving patients who had previous treatment with cisplatin/etoposide combination regimens.\n226 \nPembrolizumab, an anti -programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1) antibody, \nis approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic MSI -H/dMMR or TMB -H solid tumors that have progressed \nfollowing prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative \ntreatment options.215,216,218,227,228 In the only trial (phase II) investigating the \nefficacy of immunotherapy in testicular cancer, 12 patients with \nnonseminoma tous GCTs who progressed after first -line cisplatin -based \ntherapy and ≥1 additional  regimen (high- dose or conventional -dose PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.

There were six grade 3 adverse \nevents, but no immune- related adverse events were reported. Therefore, \npembrolizumab was well tolerated but appears to have limited single-\nagent activity in refractory GCTs. However, larger phase II and phase III \ntrials of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic or refractory testicular \ncancers are needed to fully assess the value of this therapy, especially in \ntreating MSI -H/dMMR or TMB -H testicular GCTs.  \nTreatment of Brain Metastases  \nBrain metastases from testicular GCTs are relatively rare and occur \nalmost exclusively in patients with nonseminoma histology.230 The \ndevelopment of brain metastases may be more common in patients with a higher burden of systemic disease; lung, liver, and/or bone metastases; \nhigh levels of serum beta -hCG (>5000 IU/L); in those with neurologic \nsymptoms; and in those who experience relapse after cisplatin- based \nchemotherapy. The prognosis of patients with brain metastases from testicular GCTs is poor, with > 50% of patients dying within 1 year of \ndiagnosis.\n230,231 Patients with additional adverse prognostic factors, \nespecially those with metachronous brain metastases, have even worse \noutcomes.230,232,233 \nIn a retrospective analysis, Loriot et al reported on the pattern of relapse among patients with poor -risk nonseminomatous GCTs previously treated \nwith chemotherapy.\n234 After a median follow -up of 4.1 years, 32% were \nfound to have radiographic evidence of brain metastases. The brain was \nthe only site of progression in 54% of these patients and 19% experienced \nprogression in the brain as the first progression event. Furthermore, \ninvolvement of the brain was more common among patients who were \npreviously treated with high- dose chemotherapy (29%) compared to BEP \n(12%). These data suggest that brain metastases from testicular GCTs may occur more frequently than previously thought, often as the only site \nof progression, and may be more likely to occur in  patients at  poor risk \npreviously treated with high- dose chemotherapy. However, it is unknown \nwhether this effect was due to the lower cerebral drug penetrance of the \nhigh- dose regimen.  \nThe optimal management of brain metastases from testicular GCTs is controversial, with a lack of evidence from prospective trials to guide \ntreatment decisions.\n230,232 Therefore, management decisions are usually \nbased on institutional preferences, which may in part explain the large variation in treatment modalities received by these patients. The NCCN \nGuidelines recommend first -line cisplatin -based chemotherapy  \n(chemotherapy for poor -risk disease)  for patients with brain metastases. \nThe addition of RT to chemotherapy regimens can also be considered.\n235 \nSurgical resection of metastatic brain lesions should be performed if clinically indicated and feasible. A recent  retrospective analysis  reported \nthe treatment of 25 patients  with relapsed GCTs and progressive brain \nmetastases who received multimodality therapy , which included high- dose \nchemotherapy with stem cell support alone or combined with surgery and/or stereotactic or whole -brain RT.\n236 At a median follow -up of 24.5 \nmonths, 44% of patients were alive with no evidence of disease, \nsuggesting that this subset of patients with historically poor prognosis can \npotentially be cured with this approach.   \nMalignant Transformation of Teratoma  \nTeratoma is a pluripotent tissue that has the capacity to dedifferentiate into \nsomatic malignancies. Sarcomas or carcinomas arising from teratoma are \ngenerally resistant to chemotherapy and are associated with poor \nprognosis.57,237 -239 Somatic transformation of teratoma is most frequently \nseen in patients with metastatic disease who have been treated with chemotherapy. However, this can occasionally be seen in patients who \nhave not received chemotherapy as well.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nTesticular Cancer   \n \nMS-28 tumors to systemic chemotherapy, surgical resection is the preferred \ntreatment if feasible. RPLND should be considered in patients with stage I \ndisease who have teratoma with malignant transformation in their primary \ntumor in order to eradicate any microsc opic retroperitoneal metastases \nand reduce the risk of relapse. For patients with more advanced disease (stage II or III), complete surgical resection if feasible is preferred. For \npatients with unresectable disease, histology -specific chemotherapy \nshould be considered.  \nMalignant transformation of teratoma along mesodermal lines results in a \nprimitive small round blue cell tumor referred to as embryonic -type \nneuroectodermal tumor (ENT).\n240 This was previously termed primitive \nneuroectodermal tumor (PNET) arising from teratoma. The preferred \nmodality of therapy for malignant transformation of teratoma to ENT is also \nsurgical resection. ENT transformed from teratoma is resistant to cisplatin-\nbased chemotherapy. Chemotherapy directed to ENT histology is \nassociated with objective response. The preferred regimen consists of \ncyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV) alternating with \nifosfamide plus etoposide (IE).241 For patients with stage I disease with \nENT histology, RPLND should be considered. If ENT histology is present \nin surgical resection specimen, adjuvant chemotherapy with CAV \nalternating with IE for a total of four cycles should be considered. 241,242 \nRarely, GCTs may originate in extragonadal sites (usually the retroperitoneum or mediastinum). Patients with an extragonadal primary \nsite are treated similarly to patients with testicular GCTs regarding \nsystemic therapies and management of residual masses.\n243 However, due \nto their rarity, the NCCN Panel recommends that patients with extragonadal GCTs be referred to high- volume centers with experience in \nmanaging these tumors.  Summary  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Testicular Cancer provide an evidence - and \nconsensus -based treatment approach for the treatment of adult patients \nwith seminomatous and nonseminomatous testicular GCTs. Testicular GCTs are sensitive to platinum -based chemotherapy and patients have \nhigh cure rates even with metastatic disease. Although the majority of metastatic  testicular GCTs are cured with chemotherapy, 20% to 30% of \npatients will relapse after first -line chemotherapy and require additional \ntreatment strategies. The ongoing international phase III TIGER trial aims \nto determine whether high- dose or conventional -dose chemotherapy is \nmore effective in the second- line setting for patients with relapsed disease. \nPatients with platinum -refractory or relapsing tumors after second- line \ntherapy have very poor outcomes despite subsequent -line treatments with \nno effective alternative therapies. Targeted therapies appear to have \nlimited activity in this setting, although more robust clinical trials are \nneeded to assess their value in treating testicular GCTs. Prognosis for \npatients with brain met astases remains poor, with a lack of evidence from \nprospective trials to guide treatment decisions. Therefore, the NCCN Panel encourages patients with metastatic, recurrent, or platinum -\nrefractory testicular GCTs to participate in well -designed clinical tr ials \ninvestigating novel therapeutic strategies to enable further advances for \nthe management of this disease.   \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:09:30 PM.
