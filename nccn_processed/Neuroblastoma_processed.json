Symptomatic patients should start intermediate-risk treatment emergently prior to biopsy. Once symptoms have resolved following initial \ntherapy, patients should undergo biopsy and risk assignment should be revised based on available data. See Hsu LL, et al. Med Pediatr Oncol 1996;27:521-528 for \nsymptoms; a total score ≥2 should lead to emergent therapy.\n• Footnote z added: Symptomatic patients with ongoing organ dysfunction with inadequate response to initial chemotherapy may benefit from radiation therapy (R T); \nmultidisciplinary discussion is recommended. See Principles of Radiation Therapy (NEUROB-H).\nNEUROB-11\n• Post-Consolidation Therapy\n\u0017Top pathway revised: Post-Consolidation therapy containing anti-GD2 antibody with sargramostim and isotretinoin  (category 1)\n• Footnote hh added: For patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma, treatment decisions are scenario-specific. Repeat molecular profiling should be performed if \nfeasible. Consultation with a neuroblastoma specialist should be considered.\n• Footnote jj revised: Serial monitoring of hearing with audiograms or brainstem auditory evoked response is essential a t 6-month intervals or as clinically indicated,  as \nmost patients with high-risk neuroblastoma are at a critical age for language development.\nNEUROB-A (3 of 4)\n• Molecular Genetic Testing Considerations\n\u0017Bullet 2, sub-bullet 2 revised: Amplification and sequence variants in ALK predict response to targeted agents in patients with relapsed/refractory disease .\nNEUROB-B (2 of 4)\n• Nuclear Imaging\n\u0017Bullet 5 added: Thyroid protection is required as per institutional guidance.\nUPDATESContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

Specifically,  patients with incomplete response to \nInduction who received bridging therapy and then proceeded to Consolidation therapy had superior outcomes compared to patients who received bridging therapy \nand did not move on to Consolidation . Specifically, patients with a complete response to bridging therapy in one series  who proceeded to Consolidation had \nfavorable outcomes.   \nNEUROB-D (5 of 11)\n• Consolidation therapy\n\u0017Bullet 2, last sentence revised: For example, a single  limited institution retrospective experience suggests that similar overall survival rates may be achieved with or \nwithout high-dose chemotherapy among patients with greater than a partial response in the era of anti-GD2 immunotherapy.\n\u0017Bullet 4, last sentence added: In other contexts, these patients are treated differently .\n\u0017Last bullet revised: The Panel recommends radiation to sites of residual metastatic disease present at the end-Induction disease evaluation, recognizing that not all \nsites may be feasibly targeted by external beam radiotherapy.

Enrollment in clinical trials may require additional testing.\n\u0017Typical tissue considerations:\n ◊For primary diagnosis (tumor or metastasis):\n –Surgical resection if clinically indicated\n –Incisional biopsy: >1 cm3\n –Tissue cores: at least 10 cores, ideally 20–30 mm in length obtained using a 16-gauge needle\n ◊Bilateral bone marrow biopsies and clot sections alone may not be sufficient to assess characteristics relevant to INPC1 \n• These tissue quantity requirements can be challenging to accommodate. In some cases, open rather than minimally invasive procedures \nmay be required to obtain adequate specimens for all required testing.2\n• Advanced knowledge of how much tissue is required and the condition of the tissue (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE], fresh, frozen, \ntouch preparations, etc) will increase the likelihood that required testing can be completed.  \n•  A coordinated diagnostic sampling effort including pathologists, oncologists, surgeons, and radiologists is recommended.3,4\nNEUROB-A\n1 OF 4References on \nNEUROB-A 4 of 4PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

In the setting of small samples, \nunusual locations, or undifferentiated subtype, immunohistochemical stains are helpful.\n\u0017Neuronal markers: Chromogranin, Synaptophysin\n\u0017Neural crest markers: PHOX2B (strongly recommended), tyrosine hydroxylase\n• The INPC classifies peripheral neuroblastic tumors into two prognostic groups (Favorable Histology and Unfavorable Histology),5-7 based \non:\n ◊ Tumor category based on Schwannian stroma development and subtyping based on degree of neuroblastic differentiation:\n –Neuroblastoma (Schwannian stroma-poor)\n ▪Undifferentiated subtype: This diagnosis relies heavily on ancillary tests, such as immunohistochemistry and/or molecular analysis\n ▪Poorly differentiated subtype\n ▪Differentiating subtype\n –Ganglioneuroblastoma, nodular (composite, Schwannian stroma-rich/stroma-dominant and stroma-poor)\n ▪Grade of neuroblastic differentiation (undifferentiated subtype, poorly differentiated subtype, or differentiating subtype) is determined \nfor the neuroblastoma component in this category.\n –Ganglioneuroblastoma, intermixed (Schwannian stroma-rich)\n –Ganglioneuroma (Schwannian stroma-dominant)\n –Note that the diagnosis of ganglioneuroblastoma, intermixed (Schwannian stroma-rich) or ganglioneuroma (Schwannian stroma-\ndominant) from a biopsy sample (rather than resection sample) should include a comment: “Favorable histology based on review of \nlimited material”, indicating the possibility of sampling issue resulting in missing a neuroblastoma nodule.\n ◊ Mitosis and karyorrhexis index (MKI):\n –Assessed by estimating mitotic and karyorrhectic nuclei per 5000 neuroblastic cells.  \n –Based on the MKI, all tumors in the neuroblastoma (Schwannian stroma-poor) category and neuroblastic components of \nganglioneuroblastoma, nodular (composite, Schwannian stroma-rich/stroma-dominant) category are further classified into 1 of 3 \nclasses:\n ▪Low MKI: <100/5000 cells\n ▪Intermediate MKI: 100–200/5000 cells\n ▪High MKI: ≥200/5000 cells  \n ◊Age at diagnosis\nNEUROB-A\n2 OF 4References on \nNEUROB-A 4 of 4PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

It allows rapid acquisition without motion artifacts, \nand reduces the need for sedation. \n•  MRI is superior for evaluating spinal involvement and does not involve use of ionizing radiation. \n•  Both CT and MRI may be performed at the initial evaluation, especially if the tumor is paraspinal. \n• Both modalities demonstrate typical features of primary tumors and metastasis to the liver, lymph nodes, bone, and skin.7,8\nNEUROB-B\n1 OF 4a INRG Staging (ST-1).\nb Descriptions of IDRFs (NEUROB-B 3 of 4) .

Uptake is demonstrated in up to 90% of neuroblastoma \ntumors. \n•  The high specificity and high sensitivity with improved accuracy for localization make MIBG imaging the test of choice for identification of \nmetastatic disease.10 123I-MIBG is the agent of choice for diagnostic imaging. 131I-MIBG may be useful in resource-limited settings.9 \n•  In addition to MIBG whole-body planar scintigraphy (vertex of head through feet), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) \nor SPECT/CT should be performed at sites of known or suspected disease, where available, due to improved sensitivity and anatomic \nlocalization of disease sites.10\n• Thyroid protection is required as per institutional guidance.\n•  Interpretation of MIBG tumor uptake is performed by means of semiquantitative scoring of body segments. The modified Curie score11 and \nthe International Society of Pediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma (SIOPEN) score12 are the two most commonly used systems. In North \nAmerica, the modified Curie score is used. \n•  When neuroblastoma tumors are not MIBG avid, or when MIBG imaging and anatomic imaging do not correlate, FDG-PET/CT or PET/MRI are \nuseful alternative or supplemental diagnostic tools.13\nNEUROB-B\n2 OF 4References on \nNEUROB-B 4 of 4PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

Recent clinical trials have focused on reduction of therapy \nfor patients with favorable biology and have been successful in maintaining excellent outcomes with these strategies.1-3\nOver the past 2 decades, the staging system, risk classification system, and response criteria definitions for neuroblastoma have evolved. It is important to \nnote that published results from clinical trials for patients with non–high-risk disease utilized a legacy staging system (International Neuroblastoma Staging \nSystem [INSS]) and older response criteria4 or protocol-specific response criteria.3 These NCCN guidelines are based on published data from clinical \ntrials of patients with non–high-risk disease, but also bridge the transition to currently used staging, classification, and response criteria systems where \napplicable.5-7 \nIn all patients with neuroblastoma except those with completely resected INRG Stage L1 disease, detection of MYCN amplification in tumor cells leads to \nassignment to the high-risk group rather than low- or intermediate-risk groups7 (NEUROB-2 ). For symptomatic infants with INRG stage MS disease who are \ntoo ill to undergo biopsy at the time of initial presentation, therapy is started with a presumptive assignment to the intermediate-risk group. However , if a \nbiopsy undertaken when the patient is clinically stable identifies tumor cells with MYCN amplification, the patient would then be reassigned to the high-risk \ngroup.\nTreatment approaches for low risk INRG L1 tumors involve surgical resection, except in patients under 6 months of age with adrenal tumor with maximal \ndiameter ≤3.1 cm if solid or 5 cm if at least 25% cystic component. In these infants, observation is recommended. In patients with INRG MS disease who are \nasymptomatic and have tumors with favorable biology, observation is also the preferred approach. \nIntermediate-risk treatment involves a combination of moderate intensity multi-agent chemotherapy and surgical resection. The COG study ANBL0531 \naimed to decrease number of chemotherapy cycles given to patients with more favorable tumor biology, by allowing for a larger residual primary tumor \nfollowing chemotherapy ± surgery, compared to treatment endpoints utilized on legacy clinical trials. Patients were assigned to receive a minimum number \nof cycles based on age, stage, and tumor biologic features. Using this strategy, after completion of the assigned number of cycles, disease response was \nassessed and decisions regarding additional systemic therapy, surgery, or surveillance were made. In the ANBL0531 clinical trial, protocol-specific criteria \nfor disease response were used, and primary tumor response was assessed by tumor volume reduction. The goal for groups of patients with localized, \nfavorable biology tumors was to achieve at least 50% reduction in the primary tumor volume, while patients with localized disease with less favorable tumor \nbiologic features were to continue therapy until a goal of 90% reduction in primary tumor volume (very good partial response [VGPR]) was achieved. The \ngoal treatment endpoint for metastatic disease response for patients with the equivalent of INRG MS disease and those with intermediate risk INRG Stage M \ndisease were also protocol-specific, and not identical to the legacy international neuroblastoma response criteria.4 \nSince the completion of ANBL0531, the neuroblastoma response criteria have been updated and no longer include VGPR as a response category. \nAdditionally, in the current system of response assessment, tumors are measured with a single dimension as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \nTumors (RECIST), rather than by tumor volume ( NEUROB-G 1 of 4). Until additional data become available regarding the use of the revised response criteria \nin assessment of disease in patients with non–high-risk neuroblastoma, the committee supports utilizing either volume or 1-dimensional assessments of \nprimary tumor response in this group of patients.   \nFor patients who have not achieved the targeted tumor reduction goal with the initial course of chemotherapy prescribed, multidisciplinary discussion should \ntake place. For some patients, surgical resection may be appropriate to reach the targeted treatment end point. If surgery cannot be performed safely to achieve \nthe proposed degree of tumor reduction, additional chemotherapy may be given with re-evaluation after every 2 cycles. At these timepoints, the potential risks \nand benefits of additional chemotherapy or surgery can be discussed by the multi-disciplinary treatment team. In some circumstances it may be reasonable \nto consider biopsy of the residual mass to assess for histologic differentiation, which may support observation of a tumor that does not shrink sufficiently \nwith chemotherapy and for which a surgical debulking is considered unsafe. In COG ANBL0531, cyclophosphamide and topotecan were used as the additional \ntreatment for patients who did not achieve the target response with 8 cycles of the intermediate risk therapy regimen outlined on page NEUROB-4. \nSIOPEN treatment regimens can also be considered, as similar outcomes are achieved with the SIOPEN and COG strategies.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion\n• Patients with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma have an estimated 5-year EFS rate of 51% from a large analysis reflecting 10 years of \ndata from the Children’s Oncology Group (COG).7 These outcomes have improved over time as a result of increasingly intensive multimodal \ntherapies divided into Induction, Consolidation, and Post-Consolidation phases. Much of the data summarized below is derived from \nnational phase 3 trials and the Panel encourages participation in open clinical trials when available.  \nInduction Therapy\n• The goal of initial Induction therapy is to decrease disease burden and to achieve the best possible response prior to subsequent phases of \ntherapy. This goal is achieved through a combination of multiagent chemotherapy and surgical resection of the primary tumor. In addition, \nautologous peripheral blood stem cells are collected during induction and aliquoted in a way that facilitates subsequent therapy .11  \n• There are no contemporary data comparing North American Induction regimens that have been evaluated in prospective randomized trials.  \nInstead, a number of Induction combinations have evolved over the last several decades, mainly based upon cisplatin- and alkylator-\nintensive regimens developed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Several different regimens have been used in North \nAmerican cooperative group pilot and Phase 3 trials, each enrolling >100 patients over the last 2 decades.  \n• These regimens yield broadly similar end-Induction response rates, with approximately 80% of patients having a partial response or better \nand approximately 9% of patients progressing despite these intensive regimens.12 Given the lack of prospective comparative efficacy data \nand similar response rates, toxicity considerations have driven the evolution of Induction regimens to reduce exposure to nephrotoxic and \ncardiotoxic agents. The combination of topotecan and cyclophosphamide given as cycles 1 and 2 of Induction was studied initially as part \nof a pilot trial that demonstrated the feasibility and acceptable end-Induction response rate (84%) of this approach.13 This regimen was \nadopted for use in ANBL0532, demonstrating that 39.1% of patients had a partial response or better after the first 2 cycles with topotecan \nand cyclophosphamide.14 A subsequent trial, ANBL12P1, empirically reduced Induction to 5 cycles, with an 80% end-Induction response \nrate.15 Likewise, data from MSKCC demonstrated comparable end-Induction response rates with 5 versus 7 Induction cycles.16 Therefore, a \n5-cycle Induction was included as part of the standard arm of the COG phase 3 trial, ANBL1531. The ANBL1531 Induction regimen is similar \nto the published ANBL12P1 regimen, with minor adjustments to dosing in order to align with updated COG chemotherapy standards. Given \nextensive contemporary experience with a 5-cycle Induction regimen, the Panel recommends either ANBL12P1 or ANBL1531 Induction as \npreferred regimens, with a 6-cycle regimen from ANBL0532 an additional acceptable regimen. However, the Panel acknowledges the lack \nof comparative data, and notes that other published chemotherapy regimens that achieve a similar end-Induction response rate could be \nconsidered as reasonable alternatives for individual patients.PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY \nNEUROB-D\n3 OF 11HIGH-RISK DISEASE\nReferences on \nNEUROB-D 10 of 11PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion\n• A number of strategies to improve Induction are under investigation at this time, including early addition of an ALK inhibitor for the subset \nof patients whose tumors have been found to harbor ALK aberrations. In addition, interventions such as the early administration of 131I-MIBG \nor anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody therapy are being evaluated. As robust safety and efficacy data are not yet available to support these \napproaches, the Panel does not recommend adoption of these approaches outside the context of clinical trials at this time.  \n• Surgical resection of the primary tumor and associated locoregional adenopathy is another important goal of Induction therapy ( Principles \nof Surgery [NEUROB-E]). Given the aggressive nature of these tumors, upfront resection is rarely feasible and the Panel recommends \nsurgical resection after several cycles of initial cytoreductive chemotherapy. Even after initial chemotherapy, resection with negative margins \nremains rarely feasible and is not the recommended surgical goal. Instead, two large analyses have demonstrated improved EFS and lower \nlocal relapse/progression rates in patients who had >90% resection (North American experience) or a complete macroscopic resection \n(European experience).17,18 The Panel therefore recommends this degree of resection, broadly considered a gross total resection, as the \ngoal of primary site surgery. When vital organs, major nerves, and/or major blood vessels would be threatened or would require resection to \nachieve this goal, the Panel recommends subtotal resection.  \n• The Panel recommends full disease reassessment at the end of Induction. This end-Induction evaluation is a critical decision point in the \ntreatment of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Prior analyses have demonstrated that patients with poor end-Induction response \n(less than partial response) have inferior outcomes compared to patients with more favorable end-Induction response (partial response \nor better).12 However, analyses of randomized trials evaluating different consolidation strategies support a potential role for modern \nConsolidation therapies even in patients with less than a partial response to Induction. For example, the CCG-3891 trial reported higher EFS \nfor patients with less favorable end-Induction response who were randomized to transplant (vs. continued chemotherapy).19 Likewise, the \nANBL0532 trial (see below) reported a benefit of tandem transplant (vs. single transplant) independent of end-Induction response.14\n• The Panel recommends proceeding to consolidation therapy for patients with partial response or better to Induction, though the Panel \nacknowledges that bridging therapy to improve response may be appropriate in select patients depending upon the nature of the partial \nresponse.20 Patients with progressive disease during or at the end of Induction have not typically been candidates to proceed with \nconsolidation therapy, and the Panel endorses this approach. Instead, the Panel recommends non-myeloablative therapies for these \npatients, including a chemoimmunotherapy regimen combining anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody with chemotherapy21 or participation in \nclinical trials for patients with first relapse. Patients with end-Induction minor response or stable disease require individualized decision-\nmaking. For patients with end-Induction minor response or stable disease not proceeding to consolidation therapy, the Panel recommends \na chemoimmunotherapy regimen combining anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody with chemotherapy or participation in clinical trials for patients \nwith refractory disease. Retrospective data suggest that proceeding to consolidation therapy may be appropriate for patients with an \ninadequate response to standard Induction therapy who respond to alternative “bridging” therapies.20 Specifically, patients with a complete \nresponse to bridging therapy in one series who proceeded to Consolidation had favorable outcomes.   \nNEUROB-D\n4 OF 11PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPYHIGH-RISK DISEASE\nReferences on \nNEUROB-D 10 of 11PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion\nConsolidation Therapy\n• A standard Consolidation phase includes both high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue and consolidative radiotherapy to the primary site. In North \nAmerica, it is also considered standard to administer radiotherapy to sites of residual metastatic disease remaining at the end-Induction disease evaluation.\n• High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue has been a hallmark of high-risk neuroblastoma therapy since a series of randomized trials demonstrated \nimproved outcomes with this approach compared with continued conventional chemotherapy.22 The Panel acknowledges that these randomized trials were conducted \nin a treatment era that preceded routine use of anti-GD2 directed immunotherapy and that additional work is needed to understand if subgroups of patients might benefit \nfrom consolidative approaches that do not rely on high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue. For example, a limited institution retrospective experience \nsuggests that similar overall survival rates may be achieved with or without high-dose chemotherapy among patients with greater than a partial response in the era of anti-\nGD2 immunotherapy.23\n• For patients who are candidates for consolidation therapy, the Panel recommends tandem transplantation with two consecutive rounds of high-dose chemotherapy with \nautologous stem cell rescue for the majority of patients with high-risk disease (category 1 recommendation). This recommendation is based upon the COG ANBL0532 \nrandomized phase 3 trial.14 Patients without progressive disease after a 6-cycle Induction were eligible for randomization to a single transplant with full dose carboplatin/ \netoposide/melphalan (CEM) or to tandem transplant with thiotepa/cyclophosphamide followed 6–10 weeks later with dose-reduced CEM ( NEUROB-10 ). Patients randomized \nto the tandem transplant arm had significantly improved EFS (3-year EFS 61.6% vs. 48.4% for single transplant).  \n• There are two less common subgroups of patients with high-risk disease for whom a single round of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue may be \nappropriate: 1) patients with stage L2, ≥18 months at diagnosis, unfavorable histology , AND MYCN non-amplified disease; and 2) patients with stage M, 12 to <18 months \nat diagnosis, MYCN non-amplified, with any of the following other unfavorable features: unfavorable histology; diploid DNA  content; and/or presence of segmental \nchromosomal aberrations. Patients in these two groups have historically had more favorable outcomes compared to patients with high-risk disease due to MYCN \namplification or patients with high-risk disease due to age ≥18 months at diagnosis with stage M disease. For example, in a large series from the COG, patients in these two \ngroups had 5-year EFS rates of approximately 75%–80%.7 Patients in these two more favorable subgroups were non-randomly assigned to single transplant with full dose \nCEM in ANBL0532 and the Panel endorses this approach. In other contexts, these patients are treated differently.24-28 \n• Conditioning with busulfan and melphalan (BuMel) is a preferred conditioning regimen in Europe based upon results of a randomized phase 3 trial that showed superior EFS \nwith BuMel compared to CEM following the European rapid COJEC induction regimen.29 In addition, the BuMel regimen was associated with lower rates of most adverse \nevents, though the risk of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was higher. The COG conducted a pilot trial, ANBL12P1, that demonstrated the feasibility of this approach,15 \nbut the role of BuMel in the context of North American therapy is not currently defined. Single transplant with BuMel may be an appropriate regimen for patients with a \ncontraindication to tandem transplant or for patients in subgroups for which single transplant is recommended.   \n• Radiation therapy to the primary tumor is typically administered upon recovery from high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue ( Principles of Radiation Therapy \n[NEUROB-H] ). Neuroblastoma is a radiosensitive tumor and a commonly used dose of 21.6 Gy is recommended. Recent national trials have attempted to improve local \ncontrol by augmenting radiotherapy. In COG trial A3973, a subset of patients had primary site radiotherapy fields extended to include uninvolved draining nodal stations. \nThese patients had similar local relapse/progression rates compared to patients treated without extending the radiotherapy field and this approach is not recommended.30 \nIn COG trial ANBL0532, patients with gross residual tumor following primary site resection received a boost of 14.4 Gy to gross residual tumor.31 This augmented dose did \nnot improve local relapse/progression or EFS rates compared to the historic controls. Based upon these data, the Panel does not recommend either strategy .    \n• The Panel recommends radiation to sites of residual metastatic disease present at the end-Induction disease evaluation, recognizing that not all sites may be feasibly \ntargeted by external beam radiotherapy. While repeat imaging following recovery from transplant and prior to radiation is not routinely performed, it may aid in decision \nmaking in select clinical scenarios. The recommendation to radiate residual metastatic sites of disease is based upon limited institution data supporting a benefit from this \napproach,32,33 though this approach has not been adopted internationally.  \nNEUROB-D\n5 OF 11PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPYHIGH-RISK DISEASE\nReferences on \nNEUROB-D 10 of 11PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

This approach was adopted based upon the landmark \nCCG-3891 trial that demonstrated improved outcomes in patients randomized to isotretinoin compared to no further therapy.19 Subsequently, the ANBL0032 trial \ndemonstrated a significant improvement in EFS for patients randomized to receive the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody dinutuximab + cytokines (sargramostim in cycles \n1, 3, and 5; interleukin-2 in cycles 2 and 4) + isotretinoin (2-year EFS from randomization at start of post-consolidation of 66%) compared to patients randomized to \nisotretinoin alone (2-year EFS of 46%).34 Based upon these findings, the ANBL0032 immunotherapy regimen became a standard post-consolidation regimen (category 1 \nrecommendation for use of post-consolidation therapy with anti-GD2 antibody) ( NEUROB-D 9 of 11).35  \n• More recently, data from the SIOPEN HR-NBL1 trial have called into question the role of interleukin-2 together with anti-GD2 immunotherapy. In this trial, patients were \nrandomized to receive anti-GD2 immunotherapy (dinutuximab beta) with or without subcutaneous interleukin-2.36 Interleukin-2 did not improve outcomes, but was \nassociated with increased toxicity. Based upon these findings, COG high-risk protocols no longer include interleukin-2 and the Panel endorses this approach.  \n• Other anti-GD2 antibodies may be appropriate as post-consolidation therapy. For example, dinutuximab beta given with isotretinoin but without sargramostim is a \ncommonly used post-consolidation regimen in Europe. A non-randomized comparison showed higher EFS among patients treated with this approach compared to the \nhistoric experience with isotretinoin alone.37 \nContinuation Therapy\n• Eflornithine (2,5-diamino-2-(difluoromethyl) pentanoic acid hydrochloride hydrate; DFMO) is an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, a key enzyme required for the \nsynthesis of polyamines that regulate homeostasis and promote survival in cancer cells. This agent was studied as continuation therapy in a multi-center , single arm \nPhase 2 trial (Study 3b; NCT02395666) in children with high-risk neuroblastoma that had responded to frontline therapy that included induction, consolidation, and anti-\nGD2 directed immunotherapy. Patients who had a partial response or better following standard frontline therapy were eligible to enroll on study 3b following completion \nof immunotherapy, and received eflornithine 750 mg/m2 ± 250 mg/m2 twice daily for up to 2 years. Reported adverse events included transaminitis and hearing loss.38 Data \nfrom 92 patients on Study 3b were compared with an external control arm consisting of 852 patients treated with anti-GD2 immunotherapy , cytokines and isotretinoin on \nCOG ANBL0032 who did not go on to receive eflornithine continuation therapy.39 Patients on Study 3b had superior outcomes compared to the external control group \n[EFS hazard ratio 0.48 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.85); OS hazard ratio 0.32 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.70)]. Further analyses using propensity score matching and sensitivity analyses also \ndemonstrated higher EFS and OS for patients on Study 3b, though the potential for residual confounding remains in the context of a non-randomized comparison. In \nDecember 2023, the FDA approved eflornithine for use in the continuation setting for patients with high risk neuroblastoma who have achieved a partial response or better \nfollowing completion of anti-GD2 immunotherapy. The Panel recommends that clinicians discuss eflornithine as a continuation therapy option with patients and families. \nDisease Evaluations During Frontline Therapy for High-Risk Disease\n• Following initial staging evaluations prior to the start of therapy ( ST-1), patients with high-risk disease undergo anatomic imaging (CT or MRI) of the primary site prior \nto planned surgical resection. Full disease evaluation (anatomic imaging of the primary site, 123I-MIBG scan [or FDG-PET, if MIBG non-avid disease], and bilateral bone \nmarrow aspirates and biopsies) at the end of Induction, start of post-consolidation, and at end of therapy. Patients with >5 residual MIBG-avid sites of disease at the end of \nInduction are encouraged to have a repeat 123I-MIBG scan after recovery from high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue in order to prioritize metastatic sites that might \nbe treated during consolidative radiotherapy. An 123I-MIBG scan (or FDG-PET, if MIBG non-avid disease) is recommended halfway through post-consolidation therapy, with \nanatomic imaging and bone marrow evaluations reserved for patients with residual disease identified on the disease evaluation at the start of post-consolidation.  \nOrgan Function Evaluations During Frontline Therapy for High-Risk Disease\n• Therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma is intensive and associated with both acute and long-term toxicities ( Monitoring for Late Effects [NEUROB-I] ). During treatment, \nthese patients require frequent laboratory monitoring, including blood counts, chemistry panels, and urinalyses. Detailed evaluation of renal function (often with nuclear \nmedicine measurements of glomerular filtration rate) is essential before consolidation high-dose therapy . Serial monitoring of cardiac function with electrocardiograms \nand echocardiograms is routine. Serial monitoring of hearing with audiograms or brainstem auditory evoked response is essential as most patients with high-risk \nneuroblastoma are at a critical age for language development.  \nTherapy for Adolescents and Adults with High-Risk Neuroblastoma\n• Neuroblastoma is largely a disease of young children, though adolescents and adults may occasionally present with high-risk disease. The clinical studies that inform \nthese guidelines, including toxicity data, therefore predominantly included patients <5 years of age at initial diagnosis. The general principles of high-risk therapy should \nbe applied to older patients with high-risk disease, though it is acknowledged that these patients may require a more individualized approach to treatment based upon \ncomorbid conditions and tolerance of planned therapy.   \nNEUROB-D\n6 OF 11PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC THERAPYHIGH-RISK DISEASE\nReferences on \nNEUROB-D 10 of 11PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

If more than minimal \nrisks of surgical morbidity exist, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be administered initially, as systemic therapy may reduce subsequent \nsurgical risk.2 \n\u0017In the setting of high-risk disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is nearly always indicated prior to resection. \n• For all risk groups, the surgical approach should limit morbidity and mortality, avoid resection of vital structures, and preserve organ \nfunction.  \nPrinciples of Tumor Biopsy\n• Indicated when resection at diagnosis is not possible or is not recommended due to the clinical context.\n\u0017Generally indicated for patients with metastatic disease.\n\u0017Generally indicated for patients with L2 tumors.\n•  Incisional biopsy via an open or laparoscopic/thoracoscopic approach should result in collection of >1 cm ³ of fresh viable tissue.a\n• Core biopsy can be performed by a surgeon or interventional radiologist, and should result in collection of at least 10 cores to ensure that \nthe specimen is adequate for comprehensive analysis.a,3\n•  Pathologist assessment at the time of biopsy is recommended to ensure that the tissue biopsied is viable rather than necrotic, and likely \ndiagnostic.a\nNEUROB-E\n1 OF 5a See Principles of Pathology (NEUROB-A)  for specimen requirements.

NCCN Guidelines® and this illustration may not be reproduced in any form without the express written permission of NCCN.\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.NCCN Guidelines Index\nTable of Contents\nDiscussion\nSurgical Approach by Risk Group\n• Low Risk\n\u0017Patients with INRG Stage L1 tumors are often cured with surgical resection. If upfront surgery will potentially obviate the need for chemotherapy and can \nbe safely performed with minimal morbidity, a resection should be performed. See Low-Risk Disease (NEUROB-3 ) regarding infants in whom observation \nwithout biopsy or resection is appropriate.\n• Intermediate Risk\n\u0017The decision to proceed with upfront resection without preoperative chemotherapy is based on whether IDRFs are absent or present (L1 vs. L2) and \non risk factor analysis (including evaluation of the nature of IDRFs present). When risk of surgical morbidity is deemed significant by the surgeon, \nneoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered.\n\u0017Gross total resection may be attempted following initial systemic therapy. However, preservation of vital structures and of end-organ function is of \nutmost importance in the intermediate risk context, as less than complete response has been shown to be an acceptable endpoint of therapy for patients \nwith localized intermediate risk tumors. \n\u0017Timing of resection will depend upon response to initial therapy and subsequent assessment of surgical risk. \n• High Risk\n\u0017Surgery is generally undertaken prior to completion of Induction therapy, as extended preoperative therapy is unlikely to further reduce surgical risk after \nmultiple cycles of chemotherapy have been given.4-7\n\u0017Maximal safe resection of the primary tumor should be attempted; however, residual disease adherent to critical/vital structures should not be removed if \nattempts to resect it can be expected to result in surgical morbidity, organ dysfunction, and delays in the initiation of postoperative systemic therapy.\n\u0017Resection of adjacent organs (kidney, pancreas, intestine, and neurovascular structures) is not recommended. If direct extension/infiltration of the tumor \ninto adjacent organs is identified, tumor may be left behind. Resection of adjacent organs increases the morbidity of the surgical procedure and could \nimpact the dosing/tolerance of adjuvant therapy. Margin-negative resection is rarely achieved in this context and is not the surgical goal.8\n\u0017Nephrectomy should be avoided as neuroblastoma treatment can result in significant renal toxicity , and because postoperative renal dysfunction can \nlimit therapeutic options.9\n\u0017Tumors with vascular encasement require identification, isolation, and clearance of associated major vessels. Exposure should be adequate to safely \nobtain proximal and distal vascular control. Commonly, the tumor is divided over the involved vascular structure and dissected down to the adventitia to \nallow for vessel preservation and tumor resection, but dissection should not proceed deeper than the adventitial layer to avoid vascular injury .\n ◊Tumors may be resected in multiple segments; en bloc resection is not required.\n\u0017Resection of nodal disease adherent or adjacent to the primary tumor is recommended as long as resection of this tissue is not expected to increase \nsurgical morbidity. Resection of distant lymph nodes at the time of primary tumor resection is not required.10\n• Special considerations for infants with INRG MS disease\n\u0017The primary surgical role for children with MS disease is biopsy of the primary or metastatic tumor for histologic and biologic studies when it is safe to \ndo so.  \n\u0017Infants with MS disease who are <3 months of age are at increased risk for surgical complications in the presence of massive hepatomegaly with or \nwithout coagulopathy. In some cases, systemic therapy may be required prior to biopsy. In this setting, biopsy (surgical or via percutaneous core needle)  \ncan be delayed until it can be undertaken safely.\n\u0017In extreme situations, for infants with respiratory compromise or life-threatening symptoms secondary to hepatomegaly, laparotomy and silo placement \nmay be considered to alleviate intra-abdominal pressure.\nNEUROB-E\n2 OF 5PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY\nReferences on \nNEUROB-E 5 of 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

If present, consider a cervicothoracic “trap door” or a median sternotomy with cervical \nextension incision for resection. \n• Identification and preservation of vagus nerve, brachial plexus, phrenic and other major nerves should be ensured. Intraoperative nerve \nmonitoring should be considered. Communication with the anesthesia team regarding the use or withholding of neuromuscular blockade \nshould occur preoperatively. \n• Postoperative Horner’s syndrome should be discussed with the patient/family, as this is not uncommon following resection of neck and \napical chest tumors. \n• There is no role for complete compartment-oriented cervical lymphadenectomy. \nSurgical Management: Thoracic Cavity\n• Assess for tumor encasing the thoracic aorta, vena cava, or other great vessels.\n• Assess for tracheal compression evidenced by patient symptoms or cross-sectional imaging prior to any general anesthesia. \n• A thoracotomy incision is generally indicated for large tumors or those with involvement of critical structures.\n• A thoracoscopic approach may be indicated for selective lesions, and should be the preferred approach for biopsy.11 \n• Avoid aggressive resection, retraction, or use of monopolar cautery near the recurrent laryngeal, phrenic, and vagus nerves. \n• Extension into spinal foraminae should be assessed preoperatively with a spine MRI if indicated based on primary tumor location or \nclinical symptoms. Dissection close to the spinal nerve roots should be avoided. Neural foraminal extension may be resected via a thoracic \napproach, but deep/blind tissue extraction from this region should be avoided. Leaving residual tumor in this location is favored over risking \nneurologic injury. \n• If known intraspinal extension is present, the case should be discussed with the multidisciplinary team, often including neurosurgery .\n• Thoracic/spinal imaging of the aortic branches to the spinal cord should be evaluated preoperatively. Arterial branches to the spinal cord, \nincluding the artery of Adamkiewicz, should be preserved whenever possible for multiple level thoracic paraspinal tumors, even if some \ntumor is left in situ. \n• Careful dissection posterior to the carina and near the right hemidiaphragm can minimize injury to the thoracic duct; any visible lymphatics \nshould be sealed or ligated. A thorough visual inspection for lymphatic leak should be performed prior to completion of the procedure. \nNEUROB-E\n3 OF 5PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY\nReferences on \nNEUROB-E 5 of 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

Nephrectomy should be avoided.9 \n•  Ureters may be adherent to the tumor and care should be taken to avoid injury.\n•  Preoperative MRI to assess nerve root and sacral involvement should be obtained when relevant in light of primary tumor location.\n\u0017Nerve monitoring should be considered for pelvic tumors due to proximity to the lumbosacral plexus and obturator nerve.\n• A laparoscopic approach can be considered depending on the location of the tumor and its relationship to surrounding structures, ie, \nIDRFs.12,13\nSurgical Management: Paraspinal\n• A detailed preoperative neurologic examination should be performed and any deficits documented. \n• A preoperative spine MRI should be obtained. \n•  Urgent multidisciplinary evaluation is indicated with consideration of rapid initiation of chemotherapy. Laminectomy is rarely indicated at the \ntime of diagnosis.14-17\n•  Progressive neurologic symptoms or acute deterioration following rapid initiation of systemic therapy should prompt urgent \nmultidisciplinary re-evaluation.\n \nSurgical Complications\n• Intraoperative complications are site dependent. \n•  Hemorrhage is a major risk with infiltrative tumors. Appropriate preoperative planning or intraoperative vascular surgical consultation \nshould be sought when necessary. Critical vessels including the aorta, carotid, subclavian, hepatic, mesenteric, or renal arteries should be \npreserved or repaired if injured, either primarily or with a graft, to restore flow . \n•  Nerve injuries may also occur, and primary repair should be considered utilizing intraoperative consultation with vascular, neurosurgical, or \nplastic surgical specialists.\n•  It is acceptable and recommended to leave a small amount of residual tumor adherent to vital structures if there is significant risk of injury \nwith more aggressive or complete resection. An estimate of the extent of resection should be documented in the operative report.\nNEUROB-E\n4 OF 5PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY\nReferences on \nNEUROB-E 5 of 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

For example, symptomatic patients (stage MS) with severe ongoing organ dysfunction with inadequate response to initial \nchemotherapy may benefit from RT; multidisciplinary discussion is recommended. \n\u0017RT will be delivered after recovery from high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue unless there is an indication for emergent RT .\n\u0017Intensity modulated RT (IMRT) or proton therapy can be used to reduce the risk and/or magnitude of side effects.\n\u0017The primary site is always irradiated. Metastatic sites are only irradiated if there is concern for active disease after completion of induction \nchemotherapy, demonstrated by MIBG/FDG uptake and/or persistent soft-tissue mass >1 cm3.1  \n\u0017If radiation to metastatic sites is indicated, they should be irradiated concurrently with the primary site. \n• The Panel recognizes that not all metastatic sites may be feasibly targeted by external beam radiotherapy. While repeat imaging following \nrecovery from transplant and prior to radiation is not routinely performed, it may aid in decision making in select clinical scenarios. \nThe recommendation to radiate residual metastatic sites of disease is based upon limited institution data supporting a benefit from this \napproach,1,2 though this approach has not been adopted internationally.\n•  Simulation\n\u0017Patients should be supine with appropriate immobilization for CT simulation.\n\u00174D-CT is recommended for targets that are subject to respiratory motion.3\n\u0017Consider addition of MRI simulation for paraspinal sites.\n•  Target Volume Definitions\n\u0017Primary Site:\n ◊ The gross tumor volume (GTV) will include the postoperative tumor bed, any residual disease identified after surgery and initially \ninvolved regional lymph nodes. The tumor bed will be defined by the post-induction chemotherapy , pre-surgery volume, respecting \npushing borders, and operative findings, not readily identified on imaging. Relevant CT and/or MRI studies completed after induction \nchemotherapy and prior to surgery should be fused to the CT simulation for target delineation. \n –Special consideration: if the primary tumor was resected prior to induction chemotherapy, GTV will be based on the tumor volume at \ndiagnosis.\n ◊The clinical target volume (CTV) = GTV + 1 cm, confined to anatomical borders. For instance, CTV need not extend into uninvolved \nkidneys, abdominal organs, or bones.\n ◊ If the tumor is subject to respiratory motion, an internal target volume (ITV) should be utilized based on the 4D-CT. \n ◊ The planning target volume (PTV) = CTV + 0.3–0.5 cm, depending on the institution’s standard, immobilization method ,and modality of \nin-room verification imaging.\n\u0017Metastatic Sites\n ◊ The metastatic GTV (mGTV) is defined by the post-induction chemotherapy volume. \n ◊ Metastatic CTV (mCTV) = mGTV + 1 cm, confined to anatomic borders.\n ◊ Metastatic PTV (mPTV) = mCTV + 0.3–0.5 cm, depending on the institution’s standard, immobilization method, and modality of in-room \nverification imaging\n• Neuroblastoma is a radiosensitive tumor and a commonly used dose of 21.6 Gy is recommended (NEUROB-H 2 of 3).

Generalized recommendations for screening for late effects would not be appropriate or accurate for many \npatients. It is strongly recommended to create a survivorship care plan specific to each individual patient.\nHigh-Risk Disease\n• Patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (especially those treated with myeloablative therapy) are at particularly high risk of hearing \nimpairment,a endocrine deficiencies, and growth retardation. Additional late effects common to patients with high-risk disease include:\n\u0017Chronic kidney disease\n\u0017Impaired fertility\n\u0017Cardiotoxicity\n\u0017Neurocognitive impairment\n\u0017Chronic lung disease\n\u0017Second malignant neoplasms\n• Screening for sensorineural hearing loss due to platinum chemotherapy and eflornithine is of particular importance. While the COG \nSurvivorship Guidelines  outline the minimum recommended frequency for audiologic assessment, children with impaired hearing should be \nreferred to institutional audiology and/or otolaryngology teams to determine the appropriate schedule for subsequent evaluations.\n• Patients treated for high-risk neuroblastoma are at risk for neurocognitive impairment. Risk appears to be impacted by chronic health \nconditions and specific treatments received.1 \n• Fertility preservation is an option for some patients with high-risk disease. When possible, referral to fertility specialists for further \ndiscussion prior to initiation of chemotherapy is recommended.\nNon–High-Risk Disease\n• Patients who receive chemotherapy for non–high-risk disease typically receive lower cumulative doses of chemotherapeutic agents and \nlimited to no external beam radiotherapy, and are therefore at lower risk of long-term toxicities compared to patients with high-risk disease. \nHowever, patients with non–high-risk disease constitute a heterogeneous group, and there is a wide range of cumulative chemotherapeutic \nexposures.2 \n• Refer to the COG Survivorship Guidelines  for appropriate screening and counseling related to: thyroid, cardiac, pulmonary, renal, bone, \nreproductive health, subsequent cancers (with special attention to thyroid and kidney), and other treatment-associated late effects. \nNEUROB-IFootnote\na Consider audiologic assessment during key periods for speech development, depending on exposure to ototoxic agents.\nReference\n1 Hesko C, Liu W, Srivastava DK, et al.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nNeuroblastoma   \n \n MS-2 Overview \nNeuroblastoma is a cancer that originates from the developing \nsympathetic nervous system and is the most common extracranial solid \ntumor in children.1,2 It has been estimated that over 700 patients are \ndiagnosed with neuroblastoma  annually  in the United States.3 The \nprevalence is approximately 1 per 7000 live births.2 The average age of a \npatient at the time of a neuroblastoma diagnosis is between 1 and 2 \nyears of age.3 The vast majority of individuals are ≤4 years  of age  at \ndiagnosis .4 \nNeuroblastoma is a primitive neoplasm of neuroectodermal origin \ncomposed of neuroblasts (or immature nerve cells).5 These tumors may \noccur anywhere in the sympathoadrenal neuroendocrine system \nincluding the adrenal gland, connective/soft tissue, retroperitoneum, and \nmediastinum.5  \nDue to differences in disease severity, symptoms, and clinical behavior \nof the tumor , neuroblastoma is considered a complex and heterogeneous \ndisease.1,6 For example, some patients have tumors that spontaneously \nregress without any treatment, while others are diagnosed with aggressive metastatic disease that requires multi modal  intervention.\n6  \nIn addition to disease burden and treatment -related side effects, some \npatients with neuroblastoma may face additional challenges. Limited \ndata suggest that health disparities due to race/ethnicity and \nsocioeconomic status exist among patients with neuroblastoma.6-9 For \nexample, a recent study found that the 5- year survival was higher for \nwhite (80.7%) or Hispanic (80.8%) patients with neuroblastoma \ncompared with their Black counterparts (72.6%).9  \nThese NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN \nGuidelines®) for Neuroblastoma include up- to-date guidelines for the \ntreatment  of patients with neuroblastoma. These Guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary panel of representatives from NCCN \nMember Institutions with neuroblastoma- focused expertise in the fields of \npediatric oncology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, and \nradiology. Treatment recommendations for neuroblastoma in these \nGuidelines will continue to be updated by  the NCCN Neuroblastoma \nPanel annually based on consensus and emerging clinical evidence.  \nGuidelines Development and Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development of the NCCN Guidelines® are \navailable at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria \nPrior to the development  of the NCCN Guidelines for Neuroblastoma, an \nelectronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key \nliterature in neuroblastoma published since 2012, using the search term \n“neuroblastoma.” The PubMed database was chosen because it remains \nthe most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer -\nreviewed biomedical literature.10 The search results were narrowed by \nselecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined \nto the following article types: Clinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase \nIII; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Guideline; Randomized Controlled Tri als; \nMeta -Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. The data \nfrom key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources \ndeemed as relevant to these Guidelines as discussed by the Panel have \nbeen included in this version of the Discuss ion section. \nRecommendations for which high- level evidence is lacking are based on \nthe Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and expert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation .11 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to \nuse language that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nNeuroblastoma   \n \n MS-3 classist, anti -misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; \nand inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender \nidentities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead \nfocusing on organ -specific recommendations. This language is both \nmore accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN \nGuidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male \nwhen citing statist ics, recommendations, or data from organizations or \nsources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how \nsex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably \nor inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from  sex \nassigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to \npredominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and \norganizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their future \nanalyses.  \nGenetic Risk Factors \nAlthough cases of familial neuroblastoma have been reported, they are \nrare (estimated to be about 1 %–2% of all cases).12,13 Among the cases of \nfamilial neuroblastoma that do occur, germline gain- of-function ALK \nmutations and loss -of-function PHOX2B mutations have been identified \nas causative  factors.14-16 Certain genetic syndromes are also associated \nwith neuroblastoma, such as Li -Fraumeni syndrome, and those caused \nby mutations in RAS pathway genes, including Costello syndrome, \nNoonan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis.13 Other genetic variants likely \ncontribute to familial neuroblastoma or predispose patients to sporadic \nneuroblastoma; however, additional validation studies are needed.12,17,18  \nClinical Presentation \nSymptoms associated with neuroblastoma can vary depending on the \nlocation of the tumor.19 Patients with neuroblastoma most commonly present with an abdominal mass or abdominal distension .2,20 Other signs \nand symptoms of the disease can include loss of appetite, weight loss, irritability, constipation, fever, hypertension, anemia, paralysis, bruising \nor swelling around  the eyes, bone pain, and pancytopenia.  \nOpsoclonus -myoclonus -ataxia syndrome (OMAS) is a paraneoplastic \nsyndrome associated with neuroblastoma that may also occur in a small \nsubgroup of patients.\n5,21- 24 OMAS is characterized by rapid eye \nmovements, ataxia, irritability, sleep disturbance, and irregular muscle \nmovements.  \nWorkup  \nThe w orkup for suspected neuroblastoma in a patient outside of the \nperinatal period as recommended by the NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel \nincludes a combination of tissue sampling for diagnostic evaluation and additional evaluations that involve a complete history and physical (H&P), family history assessment, laboratory tests, and imaging.\n1,20 \nHistologic evaluation and molecular characterization of the neuroblastoma tumor upon diagnosis are also essential for tumor staging, risk classification, and treatment selection in most (but not all) \npatients .\n1,6,25,26  \nDiagnostic Workup  \nBased on international consensus, one of the following criteria must be \nmet for a definitive diagnosis of neuroblastoma: 1) an unequivocal \npathologic diagnosis made from tumor tissue by light microscopy ; OR 2) \nbone marrow aspirate or trephine biopsy containing unequivocal tumor \ncells (eg, syncytia or immunocytologically positive clumps of cells) and \nincreased levels of urinary catecholamine metabolites.27 \nA neuroblastoma diagnosis should be made primarily based on tissue \nsampling  (see Diagnostic Workup in the algorithm) .

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nNeuroblastoma   \n \n MS-4 that surgical resection should be considered in the setting of localized \ndisease, particularly in the absence of image -defined risk factors (IDRFs; \nfor a description, see the Principles of Imaging in the algorithm ). When \nbiopsy rather than upfront resection is indicated, minimally invasive \nbiopsy techniques can be used; however, open biopsy may be preferred \nin some clinical scenarios  in which  adequate tissue cannot be obtained  \nby less invasive means.   \n \nMultiple core biopsies may provide adequate tissue; clinicians should consider the amount of tissue  needed for full histologic and molecular \nevaluation. It is crucial that an adequate amount of tissue be obtained to \nevaluate the  status of  key prognostic factors needed for risk \nclassification and treatment selection. Once it has been confirmed that \nsufficient tissue for clinical purposes has been obtained , preservation of  \nadditional tissue for research  is encouraged when possible . Fine-needle \naspiration (FNA ) is not recommended by the Panel. It is important that an \nexperienced pathologist review frozen sections to determine the \nadequacy of the specimen, as some samples may be necrotic at the time \nof initial biopsy.  \n \nBilateral bone marrow aspirates and trephine biopsies can be used  for \ndiagnostic purposes , particularly in rare cases in which  marrow is the \nonly source of tumor material. In these situations, every attempt should \nbe made to obtain adequate material for the full complement of \nmolecular testing.  \n \nPatients <2 months of age with existing or evolving hepatomegaly\n28 and \ninfants in whom safety considerations (coagulopathy, impending organ \nfailure) preclude biopsy  should not undergo a biopsy until after initiation \nof therapy and clinical stabilization . In these cases, biopsy should be \nperformed when it is safe to do so to obtain tissue for histologic \nevaluation and molecular testing. Patients <6 months of age with L1 \nadrenal tumor s with maximum diameter ≤3.1 cm if solid or 5 cm if at least 25% cystic do not require an initial  biopsy or resection based on data \nfrom a pro spective multicenter cooperative group study .29 \n \nSee the Pathology  section of this discussion for additional \nrecommendations regarding tissue sampling,  histologic classification, \nand molecular testing considerations.  \n \nAdditional Workup \nThe NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends that all patients undergo \nan H&P, with special attention given to the abdominal exam to evaluate \nfor masses  and organomegaly, as well as a thorough neurologic exam. \nAny family history of neuroblastoma or other childhood cancers should \nbe noted.  \nSeveral laboratory tests are considered essential as part of the workup \nfor neuroblastoma. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with \ndifferential and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Urine catecholamine \nlevels (homovanillic acid [HVA] and vanillylman delic acid [VMA]) are \nelevated in the majority of patients with neuroblastoma.19,30 Analysis of \nurine HVA and VMA levels is required for diagnosis only if bone marrow is the only diagnostic tissue obtained .  \nOther tests and assessments have been deemed as useful in selected \ncases by the NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel. Clinicians may consider \nobtaining the prothrombin (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) if the \nliver is involved or there is a concern for bleeding. Pregnancy tests should be done for all patients of childbearing potential. A referral to \nfertility specialists should be made  for patients with high- risk disease to \ndiscuss possible options and timing for fertility preservation.  \nAnalysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin levels can be \nconsidered in select cases. High levels of LDH and ferritin in patients \nwith neuroblastoma have been associated with worse prognosis; PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

For example, audiograms, echocardiograms, or \nelectrocardiograms should be done if specific  chemotherapy agents are \nto be administered.  \nImaging studies are also an essential component of the workup for \nneuroblastoma as imaging results will have a profound impact on tumor \nstaging and risk classification , and therefore are important to determine \nthe treatment strategy implemented for each patient. See the Imaging \nsection below and the Principles of Imaging in the algorithm  for additional \ninformation about imaging for patients with neuroblastoma.  \nPathology  \nSampling  \nPathology workflows should be designed to facilitate histologic diagnosis \nwith prognostic classification and molecular profiling as required for \ntreatment. The NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends a coordinated \ndiagnostic sampling effort that includes pathologists, oncologists, \nsurgeons, and radiologists.33,34 \nFor the pathology diagnosis of neuroblastoma, considerations for \nacceptable  tissue sampling from either the primary site or a site of \nmetastasis are based on the requirements for risk stratification and \ntreatment . These include:  surgical resection if clinically indicated, \nincisional biopsy (>1 cm3), or tissue cores (at least 10 cores, ideally 20–\n30 mm in length obtained using a 16 -gauge needle if possible ). \nClinicians should be aware that bilateral bone marrow biopsies and clot \nsections alone may not be sufficient to assess characteristics relevant to  the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification ( INPC ) \nsystem .35 \nThe tissue quantity requirements specified above may be challenging to meet. In some cases, open rather than minimally invasive procedures \nmay be necessary to obtain the adequate specimens for all required \ntesting.\n36 Advanced planning for the required amount and condition of \nthe tissue ( eg, formalin -fixed paraffin- embedded [FFPE], fresh, frozen, \ntouch preparations) will increase the likelihood of completing the required \ntesting. Additional testing may be required for patients enrolled in clinical \ntrials .  \nHistologic Classification \nNeuroblastoma diagnosis should be determined according to the \nInternational Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) and INPC.25,26 \nHistologic classification based on the INPC should be done prior to \ninitiation of therapy and is typically made based on hematoxylin and \neosin (H&E) staining.  \nImmunohistochemical stains can be helpful in the setting of small \nsamples, unusual locations, or undifferentiated subtypes. In these \nsituations, t he NCCN Panel recommends staining for chromogranin and \nsynaptophysin, which are widely used markers for neuroendocrine cells \nand tumors.37 Staining for the neural crest marker PHOX2B (strongly \nrecommended) and tyrosine hydroxylase are also appropriate  for these \nsituations .38  \nNeuroblastoma is part of a group known as peripheral neuroblastic \ntumors , which are tumors of the sympathetic nervous system that arise \nfrom the embryonic neural crest.39,40 The INPC distinguishes peripheral \nneuroblastic tumors into four categories mainly based on Schwannian stroma development: neuroblastoma (Schwannian stroma -poor); \nganglioneuroblastoma, intermixed (Schwannian stroma- rich); \nganglioneuroma (Schwannian stroma -dominant); and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nNeuroblastoma   \n \n MS-6 ganglioneuroblastoma, nodular (composite, Schwannian stroma -\nrich/stroma -dominant and stroma- poor).25,26 Neuroblastoma is the most \ncommon type of neuroblastic tumor .  \nThe INPC classifies peripheral neuroblastic tumors into a Favorable \nHistology group or Unfavorable Histology group. Classification  of tumors \nis based on the grade of neuroblastic differentiation (undifferentiated \nsubtype, poorly differentiated subtype, and differentiating subtype), MKI \n(Mitosis -Karyorrhexis Index = estimated mitotic and karyorrhectic nuclei \nper 5,000 neuroblastoma cells; low <100, inter mediate 100 –200, and \nhigh ≥200), and age at diagnosis. Favorable Histology tumors include:  1) \npoorly differentiated or differentiating subtype with low or intermediate MKI, ≤547 days of age at diagnosis; and 2) differentiating subtype with \nlow MKI, ≤1824 days of age at diagnosis. Unfavorable Histology tumors \ninclude:  1) undifferentiated subtype at any age; 2) high MKI at any age; \n3) poorly differentiated subtype with any MKI, ≥548 days of age at \ndiagnosis; 4) differentiating subtype with intermediate MKI, ≥548 days of \nage at diagnosis; and 5) differentiating subtype with any MKI, ≥1825 \ndays of age at diagnosis.     \nTumors in the category of ganglioneuroblastoma, intermixed and \nganglioneuroma are usually diagnosed in older children and classified \ninto the Favorable Histology group. Patients in these two categories are \nexpected to have an excellent prognosis. Tumors in the category of \nganglioneuroblastoma, nodular are composed of at least two distinct \nhistologies: one is neuroblastoma while the other is either \nganglioneuroblastoma, intermixed or ganglioneuroma. The \nneuroblastoma component usually makes discrete nodules and dictates \nclinical behavior of the tumor in this category.\n41 In order to determine the \nprognostic group ( Favorable or Unfavorable Histology group) for tumors \ncategorized as ganglioneuroblastoma, nodular, the same age- dependent \ncriteria of morphologic features (grade of neuroblastic differentiation and \nMKI) as described in the neuroblastoma category (see above) should be \napplied to the neuroblas toma component.  See Principles of Pathology  in the algorithm  for more information about \nthe histologic classification of neuroblastoma.  \nMolecular Genetic Testing Considerations \nRisk stratification for the initial  treatment of neuroblastoma is heavily \ndependent on molecular tumor profiling (see Neuroblastoma Risk \nClassification  in the algorithm).  The key prognostic molecular biomarkers \nthat should be assessed include MYCN amplification  status , segmental \nchromosomal aberration (SCA)  status , and tumor cell ploidy.  \nAmplification of the MYCN  oncogene is associated with aggressive \ndisease,  and is the strongest independent  prognostic  risk factor included \nin the neuroblastoma risk classification system.32,42,43 The NCCN \nNeuroblastoma Panel recommends t he assessment of  MYCN \namplification status in all neuroblastomas and neuroblastoma nodules of \nganglioneuroblastoma nodular tumors.  \nSCAs, defined as the loss or gain of a portion of a chromosome arm, may \nalso be associated with inferior outcome in patients with  \nneuroblastoma.32,44 The most extensively  studied SCAs in neuroblastoma \ninclude loss of genetic material from chromosome s 1p and 11q; however, \nsegmental losses involving 3p or 4p and segmental gains involving 17q, \n1q, or 2p are also considered when assigning SCA status . The P anel \nrecommends that molecular genetic testing include analysis of these \nseven SCAs  for appropriate risk stratification.  \nPloidy status, a measure of the amount of DNA within cells, is another \nprognostic factor  for a small subset  of patients .32 In general, a DNA index \n(DI) = 1 is considered less favorable than DI  >1, and ploidy has historically \nbeen used in risk classification in infants .6,45 \nNew targeted therapies for the treatment of neuroblastoma are \nemerging.46,47 For example, amplification and sequence variants in  the \nALK gene predict response to matched targeted agents.1,48- 50 Molecular PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nNeuroblastoma   \n \n MS-7 genetic testing requirements will continue to evolve as new targeted \ntherapies become available . \nAssay Selection  \nMultiple approaches using different assays can be used  for molecular \ngenetic testing  to meet the above recommendations . Next -generation \nsequencing (NGS) has become widely available and analysis of FFPE \ntissue with this approach is feasible. Using NGS to simultaneously \nevaluate for the key neuroblastoma prognostic factors ( including the \npresence of MYCN amplification  and SCAs ) and aberrations that may \nguide therapy selection (such as amplification or activating mutations in \nALK) is recommended, as long as the approach enables robust \nassessment of copy number status and can provide coverage of the \nrelevant regions of neuroblastoma- associated genes. Use of a single \nassay may be beneficial when tissue is limited.  \nThe status of the standard prognostic biomarkers can also be assessed \nusing fluorescence in situ hybridization  (FISH ), microarray, and/or flow \ncytometry; however, clinicians should be aware that these assays will not \nidentify  sequence variants in neuroblastoma -related genes such as ALK.  \nSee the Principles of Pathology section in the algorithm for additional \ninformation about molecular genetic testing considerations.  \nImaging \nA neuroblastic tumor diagnosis is usually suspected based on the patient’s age and the appearance of the tumor on imaging.\n39 The \ncombination of imaging studies to be used during the initial evaluation of a child with a suspected neuroblastic tumor depends on the symptoms and suspected sites of disease.\n19,51 Local extension of neuroblastoma \nmainly consists of vascular encasement, infiltration of adjacent soft tissues and organs ( most commonly the kidneys and liver), and infiltration of the foramina and epidural space of the spinal canal when \nthe primary tumor arises from a paraspinal sympathetic chain.  \nApproximately 50% of patients present with localized or regional disease, \nand approximately 35% of patients have regional lymph node spread at \ntime of diagnosis.\n52 The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) \nTask Force developed the INRG Staging System (INRGSS) and the \nINRG Risk Classification System for neuroblastoma, which ha ve \nprofound implications for imaging in this disease .32,40 Moreover, w hile \nsoft tissue tumor volume was previously used to measure response in \nthe prior International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria ( INRC) , the \nrevised INRC use RECIST criteria for the measurement of soft tissue \ndisease, using assessment of the single longest dimension of soft tissue \nlesions .53,54 \nThe primary goals of imaging in a patient with suspected neuroblastoma \nare to identify features consistent with a neuroblastic tumor,55 assess for \nthe presence of IDRFs to facilitate INRG staging (see the Staging section \nbelow),40 help estimate the potential surgical risk that would be \nassociated with local tumor excision, assess for the presence and \ndegree of regional and distant metastatic disease, and facilitate post -\ntreatment response assessment and disease surveillance.  \nThe NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends cross -sectional imaging \n(MRI with/without contrast or CT with contrast) to evaluate soft tissue \ndisease at the time of initial evaluation. MRI of the spine with/without \ncontrast is appropriate in the setting of paras pinal disease or if there are \nconcerns regarding involvement of nerve roots or spinal cord. MRI of the \nbrain with/without contrast or CT skull/orbits with contrast should be done \nif neurological symptoms are present or if otherwise clinically indicated.  \n123Iodine- metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) imaging should be used \nto assess for metastatic disease due to the high specificity and high \nsensitivity  of this tracer .

Interpretation of 123I-MIBG imaging  is \nperformed by means of semiquantitative scoring of  tracer update within \nbody segments. The modified Curie score56 and the International Society \nof Pediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma (SIOPEN) score57 are the \ntwo most commonly used systems. In North America, the modified Curie \nscore is used. If available, single -photon emission CT ( SPECT ) or \nSPECT/CT should be performed at sites of known or suspected disease \nto improve sensitivity and anatomic localization of disease sites.58 \n18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET imaging should be obtained in \npatients with 123I-MIBG non -avid disease or suspected mixed- avidity \ndisease, with the exception of patients who are <6 months of age with L1 \nadrenal tumor s ≤3.1 cm in diameter if solid or <5 cm if at least 25% \ncystic component.29 FDG -PET/CT and PET/MRI can also be useful \nalternative or supplemental diagnostic tools when 123I-MIBG imaging and \nanatomic imaging do not correlate. See Principles of Imaging  in the \nalgorithm  for additional information.  \nImaging is also an important component of post -treatment response \nassessment and disease surveillance. See the Response Assessment  \nand Disease Surveillance sections for more information.  \nStaging \nThe NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends using the neuroblastoma \nstaging system developed by the INRG (see Staging in the algorithm ).40 \nThis system was developed to improve the consistency and uniformity of \ntumor staging for patients with neuroblastoma by ensuring that disease staging could be done before initiation of treatment. Tumor stage defined \nby the INRG SS is also a key prognostic factor accounted for in the \nupdated Children’s Oncology Group (COG) neuroblastoma risk \nclassification system (see Neuroblastoma Risk Classification  in the \nalgorithm ).\n32 As risk classification is used to guide neuroblastoma treatment, it is essential for disease staging to be completed before \ninitiation of treatment  when possible. Initiation of emergent therapy, if \nneeded, should not be delayed for 123I-MIBG  or FDG -PET imaging; \nhowever, this imaging should be obtained as soon as possible . \nIn the INRG SS, localized tumors are classified based on the number of \nIDRFs  present. While the currently used list of IDRFs is derived from a \nconsensus list of risk factors initially developed to guide surgical \ndecision -making, IDRFs are thought to be proxies for tumor biologic \nfeatures that are not yet well understood . See Principles of Imaging  in \nthe algorithm  for a description of IDRFs.  \nAn L1 tumor is defined as a localized tumor that is not involved with vital \nstructures, as defined by the list of IDRFs, and is confined to one body compartment. An L2 tumor is described as a loc oregional tumor with the \npresence of one or more IDRFs. A  patient with stage M neuroblastoma \nhas distant metastatic disease, except for the special case of young children with INRG stage MS disease. MS neuroblastoma is diagnosed \nonly in  children who  are <18 months, with metastases confined to the \nskin, liver, and/or  bone marrow  (limited marrow disease) .  \nRisk Classification  \nThe risk classification criteria incorporated into the NCCN Guidelines  is \nadapted from an updated risk classifier published by the COG in 2021.32 \nThe assigned risk group is based on outcomes data generated over \nrecent decades.26,32,59- 61 Event -free survival (EFS) and overall survival \n(OS) outcomes are influenced by key prognostic risk factors , including: \nage at diagnosis, INRG stage (see the Staging section above ), tumor \nMYCN status (ie, presence or absence of MYCN amplification), \nhistopathology (favorable or unfavorable based on INPC ), presence or \nabsence of SCAs, and ploidy status (diploid or hyperdiploid).

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nNeuroblastoma   \n \n MS-9 It should be noted that treatment substantially impacts outcome, and \noutcomes achieved often reflect the effects of different types of therapy \nwithin a given risk group. However, risk classification must occur in \npractice prior to the start of therapy. The risk assignments that follow \ntherefore reflect pre -treatment decision -making, taking into account \ntreatment admi nistered to prior patients with neuroblastoma over time.  \nBased on this classification system, patients of any age with L1 disease \nwith tumors that are MYCN  non-amplified  are included in the low -risk \ngroup. Patients with L1 disease and tumor MYCN amplification would \nonly be considered low risk if complete resection is achieved . If residual \ntumor remains post -resection, patients with L1, MYCN -amplified tumors \nare considered to have high -risk disease. Asymptomatic patients who \nare <12 months of age with MS disease  and Favorable Histology tumor \nthat is demonstrated to be MYCN non-amplified , hyperdiploid , and  \nwithout SCAs are also assigned to the low -risk group.  \nPatients who are between 12 and 18 months of age with M or MS  stage \ndisease with tumors that are found to have unfavorable prognostic \nfactors such as Unfavorable Histology, presence of SCAs, or MYCN \namplification are assigned to  the high- risk group. Patients who are ≥18 \nmonths with M stage disease are also assigned to the high -risk group \nregardless of any other features.  Apart from those with L1 disease and \ncompletely resected tumors (who are considered to have low -risk \ndisease despite  MYCN status ), detecti on of MYCN  amplification leads to \nassignment to the high -risk group  regardless of age or stage .32 \nThe intermediate- risk group generally includes patients whose disease \ncharacteristics do not meet the criteria for either the low -risk or high -risk \ngroups. See Neuroblastoma Risk Classification  in the algorithm for the \ndetailed Neuroblastoma Risk Classification table.  \nFor symptomatic infants with INRG stage MS disease who are too ill to \nundergo biopsy at the time of initial presentation (such as those with coagulopathy or impending organ failure), and especially those with hepatomegaly leading to respiratory compromise,\n62 therapy is started \nwith a presumptive assignment to the intermediate -risk group. However, \nif a biopsy undertaken when the patient is clinically stable identifies \ntumor cells with MYCN  amplification, the patient would then be \nreassigned to the high- risk group.  \nClinicians should be aware that there are differences between the COG \nrisk classifier and criteria used by cooperative groups outside of North \nAmerica.32,63,64 For example, patients with L2 , MYCN non-amplified \ndisease  who are >18 months  of age at diagnosis  and have Unfavorable \nHistology or whose tumor s are undifferentiated/poorly differentiated are \nclassified  as high risk by COG criteria, but may be categorized as \nintermediate risk by other groups.  \nFor the complete criteria for each risk group, see Neuroblastoma Risk \nClassification  and Principles of Risk Classification  in the algorithm .  \nTreatment for Patients with Newly Diagnosed \nNeuroblastoma \nDue to the complex nature of the disease, it is recommended that a \nmultidisciplinary team be involved in making treatment decisions for patients with neuroblastoma. The team should include  at a minimum : \ndiagnostic radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians, interventional \nradiologists, surgeons, anatomic pathologists, molecular pathologi sts, \nradiation oncologists, and pediatric oncologists.  \nNon–High -Risk Disease \nOver the past two decades, the staging system, risk classification \nsystem, and response criteria definitions for neuroblastoma have \nevolved.

Five-year \nsurvival rates are >95% for patients with low -risk neuroblastoma and \napproximately 90% to 95% for those with intermediate -risk \nneuroblastoma.20,32 The goal of therapy for these patients is to cure the \ndisease with minimal toxicity. Recent clinical trials have focused on \nreduction of therapy for patients with favorable biology and have been \nsuccessful in maintaining excellent outcomes with these stra tegies.28,67,68 \nTreatment for Low -Risk Neuroblastoma  \nTreatment approaches for patients with low-risk INRG L1 tumors involve \nsurgical resection, with the exception of those who are <6 months old \nwith isolated adrenal masses with maximum diameter ≤ 3.1 cm  if solid, or \n5 cm if at least 25% of the mass is cystic.  For these patients , observation  \nwithout biopsy  is the recommended approach. If upfront surgery will \npotentially obviate the need for chemotherapy and can be safely \nperformed with minimal morbidity, a resection should be performed (see \nPrinciples of Surger y in the algorithm ). If the resection is incomplete, and \nMYCN amplification is detected, the patient should be reassigned to the \nhigh- risk group. In patients with INRG MS disease who are asymptomatic \nand have tumors with favorable biology, observation is also the preferred approach. For complete treatment recommendat ions for low -risk \nneuroblastoma, see Low-Risk Disease  in the algorithm .  Treatment for Intermediate -Risk Neuroblastoma  \nIntermediate -risk treatment involves a combination of moderate- intensity \nmultiagent chemotherapy and surgical resection  (see Principles of \nSystemic Therapy  and Principles of Surgery  in the algorithm ).  \nThe North American treatment strategy for patients with intermediate- risk \nneuroblastoma is based on results of t he COG study ANBL0531 , which  \naimed to decrease the number of chemotherapy cycles given to patients \nwith more favorable tumor biology, by allowing for a larger residual \nprimary tumor following chemotherapy with or without surgery, compared \nto treatment endpoints utilized on legacy clinical trials.28 Patients were \nassigned to receive a minimum number of cycles based on age, stage, \nand tumor biologic features.  \nThe NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends that patients with \nintermediate- risk neuroblastoma receive 2 to 8 cycles of chemotherapy, \nwith the number of cycles being dependent on a combination of factors \n(including disease stage, age, and biologic features; see Intermediate -\nRisk Disease  in the algorithm ). Favorable biologic features include \nFavorable Histology, DI >1, and no SCA. If SCA or histology status are \nunavailable, then clinicians should consider the tumor to have unfavorable biologic features. For infants with stage MS disease who are too unstable to undergo biopsy before starting treatment, the Panel \nrecommends initiating chemotherapy and then obtaining a  biopsy when it \nis safe to do so.  \nIn the ANBL0531 clinical trial, protocol -specific criteria for disease \nresponse were used, and primary tumor response was assessed based \non tumor volume reduction. The goal for groups of patients with \nlocalized, favorable biology tumors was to achieve at least a 50% \nreduction in the primary tumor volume, while patients with localized \ndisease with less favorable tumor biologic features were to continue \ntherapy until a goal of 90% reduction in primary tumor volume (very good partial response [VGPR]) was achie ved.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nNeuroblastoma   \n \n MS-11 metastatic disease response for patients with the equivalent of INRG MS \ndisease and those with intermediate- risk INRG stage M disease were \nalso protocol -specific, and not identical to the legacy INRC .27 \nSince the completion of ANBL0531, the neuroblastoma response criteria \nhave been updated and no longer include VGPR as a response category. Additionally, in the current system of response assessment, \ntumors are measured with a single dimension as per Respon se \nEvaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), rather than by tumor \nvolume (see Response Assessment in the algorithm ).\n53 Until additional \ndata become available regarding the use of the revised response criteria in assessment of disease in patient s with non –high- risk neuroblastoma, \nthe committee supports utilizing either volume or 1 -dimensional \nassessments of primary tumor response in this group of patients.  \nAfter completion of the assigned number of chemotherapy cycles, the NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends surveillance if the targeted tumor reduction goal was achieved (see Intermediate -Risk Disease  in \nthe algorithm ). If the targeted tumor reduction goal with the initial course \nof chemotherapy regimen was not achieved, a multidisciplinary \ndiscussion regarding  the role of surgery versus additional chemotherapy \nshould be undertaken on an iterative basis, and surveillance should only \nbegin once the target response or reduction in primary tumor size, as \nnoted  in the guidelines , is achieved with chemotherapy and/or surgery.  \nFor some patients, surgical resection may be appropriate to reach the targeted treatment endpoint. Surgical resection  should be considered if \nchemotherapy has resulted in <50% reduction in tumor size . The \npreservation of vital structures and of end -organ function is of utmost \nimportance in the intermediate- risk context, as less than complete \nresponse has been shown to be an acceptable endpoint of therapy for patients with localized intermediate -risk tumors. The timing of resection \nwill depend on the respons e to initial therapy and subsequent assessment of surgical risk.  Multidisciplinary discussion regarding the \noptimal timing of resection should occur.  \nIf surgery cannot be performed safely to achieve the proposed degree of \ntumor reduction, additional chemotherapy may be given with re -\nevaluation after every 2 cycles. At these timepoints, the potential risks \nand benefits of additional chemotherapy or surge ry can be further \ndiscussed by the multidisciplinary treatment team.  \nIn some circumstances it may be reasonable to consider biopsy of the \nresidual mass to assess for histologic differentiation, which may support \nobservation of a tumor that does not  shrink sufficiently with \nchemotherapy and for which a surgical debulking is considered unsafe. In COG ANBL0531, cyclophosphamide and topotecan were used as additional treatment for patients who did not achieve the target response \nwith 8 cycles of the inte rmediate -risk therapy regimen outlined in \nIntermediate -Risk Disease  in the al gorithm .\n28 SIOPEN treatment \nregimens can also be considered, as similar outcomes are achieved with the SIOPEN and COG strategies.\n69 \nFor complete treatment recommendations for intermediate- risk \nneuroblastoma, see Intermediate- Risk Disease in the algorithm .  \nHigh -Risk Disease  \nApproximately half of newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma have \nhigh- risk disease.65,66 Patients with newly diagnosed high- risk \nneuroblastoma have an estimated 5 -year EFS rate of 51% from a large \nanalysis reflecting 10 years of data from the COG.32 These outcomes \nhave improved over time as a result of increasingly intensive multimodal \ntherapies divided into induction, consolidation, and post-consolidation \nphases.

This goal is achieved through a combination of multiagent \ncytoreductive chemotherapy and surgical resection of the primary tumor  \nand locoregional disease ( see High-Risk Disease  in the algorithm ). In \naddition, autologous peripheral blood stem cells are collected during \ninduction to facilitate subsequent therapy.  \nThere are no contemporary data comparing North American induction \nregimens that have been evaluated in prospective randomized trials. \nInstead, a number of induction combinations have evolved over the last \nseveral decades, mainly based upon cisplatin - and alkylator -intensive \nregimens developed at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center \n(MSKCC).70 Several different regimens have been used in North \nAmerican cooperative group pilot and Phase 3 trials , each enrolling over \n100 patients over the last 2 decades.71 \nThese regimens yield broadly similar end -induction response rates, with \napproximately 80% of patients having a partial response or better and approximately 9% of patients progressing despite these intensive \nregimens.\n71 Given the lack of prospective comparative efficacy data and \nsimilar response rates, toxicity considerations have driven the evolution \nof induction regimens to reduce exposure to nephrotoxic and cardiotoxic \nagents. The combination of topotecan and cyclophosphamide given as \ncycles 1 and 2 of induction was studied initially as part of a pilot trial that \ndemonstrated the feasibility and acceptable end- induction response rate \n(84%) of this approach.72 This regimen was adopted for use in \nANBL0532, demonstrating that 39.1% of patients had a partial response \nor better after the first 2 cycles with topotecan and cyclophosphamide.73  A subsequent trial, ANBL12P1, empirically reduced induction to 5 cycles, \nwith an 80% end- induction response rate.74 Likewise, data from MSKCC \ndemonstrated comparable end -induction response rates with 5 versus 7 \ninduction cycles.70 Therefore, a 5- cycle induction was included as part of \nthe standard arm of the COG phase 3 trial, ANBL1531. The ANBL1531 induction regimen was similar to the published ANBL12P1 regimen, with \nminor adjustments to dosing in order to align with updated COG \nchemotherapy standards. Given extensive contemporary experience with a 5-cycle induction regimen, the NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel  \nrecommends either ANBL12P1 or ANBL1531 induction as preferred \nregimens, with a 6 -cycle regimen from ANBL0532 as an additional \nacceptable regimen  (see Principles of Systemic Therapy  in algorithm ). \nHowever, the NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel acknowledges the lack of \ncomparative data, and notes that other published chemotherapy \nregimens that achieve a similar end- induction response rate could be \nconsidered as reasonable alternatives for individual patients.  \nSeveral strategies to improve induction are under investigation at this \ntime, including early addition of ALK inhibitor s for patients whose tumors \nharbor ALK aberrations.\n75 In addition, interventions such as the early \nadministration of 131I-MIBG or anti -GD2 monoclonal antibody therapy are \nbeing evaluated.75 As robust safety and efficacy data are not yet \navailable to support these approaches, the Panel does not recommend \nadoption of these approaches outside the context of clinical trials at this \ntime.  \n \nSurgical resection of the primary tumor and associated locoregional \nadenopathy is another important goal of induction therapy (see Principles \nof Surgery  in the algorithm  for additional information) . Given the \naggressive nature of these tumors, upfront resection is rarely feasible \nand the NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel  recommends surgical resection \nafter several cycles of initial cytoreductive chemotherapy.

Instead, two large analyses \nhave demonstrated improved EFS and lower local relapse/ progression \nrates in patients who had >90% resection (North American experience) \nor a complete macroscopic resection (European experience).76,77 The \nNCCN Panel  therefore recommends this degree of resection, broadly \nconsidered a gross total resection, as the goal of primary site surgery. \nWhen vital organs, major nerves, and/or major blood vessels would be \nthreatened or would require resection to achieve this goal , the Panel \nrecommends subtotal resection.  \n \nThe NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends full disease \nreassessment at the end of induction. This end -induction evaluation is a \ncritical decision point in the treatment of patients with high- risk \nneuroblastoma. Prior analyses have demonstrated that patients with \npoor end -induction response (less than partial response) have inferior \noutcomes compared to patients with more favorable end- induction \nresponse (partial response or better).71 However, analyses of \nrandomized trials evaluating different consolidation strategies support a \npotential role for modern consolidation therapies even in patients with \nless than a partial response to induction. For example, the CCG -3891 \ntrial reported higher EFS for patients with less favorable end- induction \nresponse who were randomized to transplant (vs. continued chemotherapy).\n78 Likewise, the ANBL0532 trial (see below) reported a \nbenefit of tandem transplant (vs. single transplant) independent of end -\ninduction response.73 \n The NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends proceeding to \nconsolidation therapy for patients with partial response or better to \ninduction, though the Panel acknowledges that bridging therapy to \nimprove response may be appropriate in select patients depending upon \nthe nature of the partial response.\n79 Patients with progressive disease \nduring or at the end of induction have not typically been candidates to \nproceed with consolidation therapy, and the Panel endorses this approach. Instead, the Panel recommends non -myeloablative therapies \nfor these patients, including a chemoimmunotherapy regimen combining anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody with chemotherapy\n80 or participation in \nclinical trials for patients with first relapse.  \n \nPatients with end -induction minor response or stable disease require \nindividualized decision- making. For patients with end -induction minor \nresponse or stable disease not proceeding to consolidation therapy, the \nPanel recommends a chemoimmunotherapy regimen combining anti -\nGD2 monoclonal antibody with chemotherapy or participation in clinical \ntrials for patients with refractory disease. Recent retrospective data \nsuggest that proceeding to consolidation therapy may be appropriate for \npatients with an inadequat e response to standard induction therapy \nwhose disease  respond s to alternative “bridging” therapies.79 \nSpecifically, patients with incomplete response to induction who received \nbridging therapy and then proceeded to c onsolidation therapy had \nsuperior outcomes compared to patients who received bridging therapy \nand did not move on to consolidation. Moreover, patients with a complete \nresponse to bridging therapy who proceeded to consolidation had \nfavorable outcomes.  \n \nConsolidation Therapy  \nA standard consolidation phase includes both high- dose chemotherapy \nwith autologous stem cell rescue and consolidative radiotherapy to the primary site. In North America, it is also considered standard to \nadminister radiotherapy to sites of residual metastatic disease  remaining \nat the end -induction disease evaluation.  \n \nHigh -dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue has been a \nhallmark of high- risk neuroblastoma therapy since a series of \nrandomized trials demonstrated improved outcomes with this approach \ncompared with continued conventional chemotherapy.\n81 The NCCN \nNeuroblastoma Panel  acknowledges that these randomized trials were PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nNeuroblastoma   \n \n MS-14 conducted in a treatment era that preceded routine use of anti -GD2–\ndirected immunotherapy and that additional work is needed to \nunderstand if subgroups of patients might benefit from consolidative \napproaches that do not rely on high -dose chemotherapy with autologous \nstem cell rescue. For example, a single -institution retrospective \nexperience suggests that similar OS  rates may be achieved with or \nwithout high- dose chemotherapy among patients with greater than a \npartial response in the era of anti -GD2 immunot herapy.82 \n \nFor patients who are candidates for consolidation therapy, the NCCN \nNeuroblastoma Panel  recommends tandem transplantation with two \nconsecutive rounds of high- dose chemotherapy with autologous stem \ncell rescue for most patients with high- risk disease ( a category 1 \nrecommendation). This recommendation is based on data from the COG \nANBL0532 randomized phase 3 trial.73 Patients without progressive \ndisease after a 6 -cycle induction were eligible for randomization to a \nsingle transplant with full -dose carboplatin/etoposide/melphalan (CEM) \nor to tandem transplant with thiotepa/cyclophosphamide followed 6  to 10 \nweeks later with dose -reduced CEM. Patients randomized to the tandem \ntransplant arm had significantly improved EFS (3 -year EFS 61.6% vs. \n48.4% for single transplant).  \n \nThere are two less common subgroups of patients with high- risk disease \nfor whom a single round of high -dose chemotherapy with autologous \nstem cell rescue may be appropriate: 1) patients with stage L2, ≥18 \nmonths at diagnosis, Unfavorable Histology, AND MYCN  non-amplified \ndisease; and 2) patients with stage M, 12 to <18 months at diagnosis, MYCN  non-amplified, with any of the following other unfavorable \nfeatures: Unfavorable Histology; diploid DNA content; and/or presence of \nSCAs . Patients in these two groups have historically had more favorable \noutcomes compared to patients with high- risk disease due to MYCN  \namplification or patients with high- risk disease due to age ≥18 months at \ntime of diagnosis of stage M disease. For example, in a large series from the COG, patients in these two groups had 5- year EFS rates of \napproximately 75%  to 80%.\n32 Patients in these two more favorable \nsubgroups were non -randomly assigned to single transplant with full -\ndose CEM in ANBL0532 , and the Panel endorses this approach.  \n \nThe combination of  busulfan and melphalan (BuMel) is a preferred \nconditioning regimen in Europe based upon results of a randomized \nphase 3 trial that showed superior EFS with BuMel compared to CEM \nfollowing the European rapid COJEC induction regimen.83 In addition, the \nBuMel regimen was associated with lower rates of most adverse events, \nthough the risk of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was higher. The COG \nconducted a pilot trial, ANBL12P1, that demonstrated the feasibility of \nthis approach,74 but the role of BuMel in the context of North American \ntherapy is not currently defined. Single transplant with BuMel may be an \nappropriate regimen for patients with a contraindication to tandem \ntransplant or for patients in subgroups for which single transplant is \nrecommended.  \n \nRadiation therapy (RT) to the primary tumor is typically administered \nupon recovery from high -dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. \nNeuroblastoma is a radiosensitive tumor , and a commonly used dose of \n21.6 Gy is recommended. Recent national trials have attempted to \nimprove local control by augmenting radiotherapy.84,85 In COG trial \nA3973, a subset of patients had primary site radiotherapy fields extended \nto include uninvolved draining nodal stations.  As these patients had \nsimilar local relapse/ progression  rates compared to patients treated \nwithout extending the radiotherapy field , this approach is not \nrecommended  by the Panel.85 In COG trial ANBL0532, patients with \ngross residual tumor following primary site resection received a boost of \n14.4 Gy to gross residual tumor.84 This augmented dose did not improve \nlocal relapse/ progression  or EFS rates compared to the historic controls. \nBased upon these data, the Panel does not recommend either strategy.  \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nNeuroblastoma   \n \n MS-15 The NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends radiation to sites of \nresidual metastatic disease remaining by 123I-MIBG or FDG- PET (if MIBG \nnon-avid) at the end -induction disease evaluation, recognizing that not all \nsites may be feasibly targeted by external beam RT  (EBRT) . This \nrecommendation is based upon single- institution data supporting a \nbenefit from this approach,86,87 though this approach has not been \nadopted internationally. See Principles of Radiation Therapy  in the \nalgorithm  for additional information.  \n \nPost -Consolidation Therapy  \nThe NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends post -consolidation \ntherapy containing an anti -GD2 antibody for those who do not \nexperience disease progression after consolidation therapy, while \nchemoimmunotherapy or participation in a clinical trial is recommended \nfor those with progressive disease ( see High-Risk Disease  in the \nalgorithm ).  \n \nHistorically, post -consolidation therapy consisted of 6 cycles of \nisotretinoin administered as a differentiating agent. This approach was \nadopted based upon the landmark CCG -3891 trial that demonstrated \nimproved outcomes in patients randomized to isotretinoin compared to \nno further therapy.78 Subsequently, the ANBL0032 trial demonstrated a \nsignificant improvement in EFS for patients randomized to receive the \nanti-GD2 monoclonal antibody dinutuximab + cytokines (sargramostim in \ncycles 1, 3, and 5; interleukin- 2 in cycles 2 and 4) + isotretinoin  (2-year \nEFS from randomization at start of post -consolidation therapy of 66%) \ncompared to patients randomized to isotretinoin alone (2 -year EFS of \n46%).88 Based upon these findings, the ANBL0032 immunotherapy \nregimen became a standard post -consolidation regimen (category 1 \nrecommendation for use of post -consolidation therapy with anti -GD2 \nantibody) ( see Principles of Systemic Therapy  in the algorithm ).89 \n Data  from the SIOPEN HR -NBL1 trial called into question the role of \ninterleukin -2 together with anti -GD2 immunotherapy. In this trial, patients \nwere randomized to receive anti -GD2 immunotherapy (dinutuximab beta) \nwith or without subcutaneous interleukin- 2.90 Interleukin- 2 did not \nimprove outcomes  and was associated with increased toxicity. Based \nupon these findings, COG high -risk protocols no longer include \ninterleukin -2, and the Panel endorses this approach.  \n \nOther anti -GD2 antibodies may be appropriate as post -consolidation \ntherapy. For example, dinutuximab beta given with isotretinoin but \nwithout sargramostim is a commonly used post -consolidation regimen in \nEurope. A non -randomized comparison showed higher EFS among \npatients treated with this approach compared to the historic experience \nwith isotretinoin alone.91 \n \nContinuation Therapy  \nEflornithine [2,5-diamino -2-(difluoromethyl) pentanoic acid hydrochloride \nhydrate; DFMO ] is an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, a key enzyme \nrequired for the synthesis of polyamines that regulate homeostasis and \npromote survival in cancer cells. This agent was studied as continuation \ntherapy in a multicenter, single -arm, phase 2 trial (Study 3b; \nNCT02395666) in children with high- risk neuroblastoma that had \nresponded to frontline therapy that included induction, consolidation, and \nanti-GD2 directed imm unotherapy. Patients who had a partial response \nor better following standard frontline therapy were eligible to enroll in \nStudy 3b following completion of immunotherapy and received \neflornithine 750 mg/m2 ± 250 mg/m2 twice daily for up to 2 years. \nReported adverse events included transaminitis and hearing loss.92  \n Data from 92 patients on Study 3b were compared with an external control arm consisting of 852 patients treated with anti -GD2 \nimmunotherapy, cytokines , and isotretinoin on COG ANBL0032 who did \nnot go on to receive eflornithine continuation therapy.\n93 Patients on Study PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nNeuroblastoma   \n \n MS-16 3b had superior outcomes compared to the external control group [EFS \nhazard ratio  (HR),  0.48 (95% CI , 0.27 –0.85); OS HR, 0.32 (95% CI , 0.15 –\n0.70)]. Further analyses using propensity score matching and sensitivity \nanalyses also demonstrated higher EFS and OS for patients on Study \n3b, though the potential for residual confounding remains in the context \nof a non -randomized comparison.  \n \nIn December 2023, the FDA approved eflornithine for use in the \ncontinuation setting for patients with high -risk neuroblastoma who have \nachieved a partial response or better following completion of anti -GD2 \nimmunotherapy.94 The NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel suggests  that \nclinicians discuss eflornithine as a continuation therapy option with \npatients and families ; this is a category 2B recommendation . Serial \nmonitoring of hearing with audiograms or brainstem auditory evoked \nresponse is essential , as most patients with high -risk neuroblastoma are \nat a critical age for language development.  \n \nDisease Evaluations During Frontline Therapy for High -Risk Disease \nFollowing initial staging evaluations  prior to the start of therapy ( see the \nStaging  section above ), patients with high- risk disease undergo anatomic \nimaging (CT or MRI) of the primary site prior to planned surgical \nresection. Full disease evaluation (anatomic imaging of the primary site, \n123I-MIBG scan [or FDG -PET, if MIBG non -avid disease], and bilateral \nbone marrow aspirates and biopsies)  is recommended  at the end of \ninduction, start of post -consolidation, and end of therapy. Patients with \nmore than five  residual MIBG -avid sites of disease at the end of \ninduction are encouraged to have a repeat 123I-MIBG scan after recovery \nfrom high -dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue to prioritize \nmetastatic sites that might be treated during consolidative radiotherapy. An \n123I-MIBG scan (or FDG -PET, if MIBG non -avid disease) is \nrecommended halfway through post -consolidation therapy, with anatomic \nimaging and bone marrow evaluations reserved for patients with residual disease identified on the disease evaluation at t he start of post -\nconsolidation  therapy . \n \nOrgan Function Evaluations During Frontline Therapy for High -Risk \nDisease  \nTherapy for high -risk neuroblastoma is intensive and associated with \nboth acute and long- term toxicities (see the Monitoring for Late Effects  \nRelated to Neuroblastoma Treatment  section  below ). During treatment, \nthese patients require frequent laboratory monitoring, including blood counts, chemistry panels, and urinalyses. Detailed evaluation of renal \nfunction (often with nuclear medicine measurements of glomerular \nfiltration rate) is essential before consolidation high- dose therapy. Serial \nmonitoring of car diac function with electrocardiograms and \nechocardiograms is routine. Serial monitoring of hearing with audiograms \nor brainstem auditory  evoked response is essential , as most patients \nwith high -risk neuroblastoma are at a critical age for language \ndevelopment.  \n \nTherapy for Adolescents and Adults with High -Risk Neuroblastoma  \nNeuroblastoma is largely a disease of young children, though \nadolescents and adults may occasionally present with high -risk disease. \nThe clinical studies that inform these guidelines, including toxicity data, \ntherefore predominantly included patients <5 years of age at initial \ndiagnosis. The general principles of high -risk therapy should be applied \nto older patients with high -risk disease, though it is acknowledged that \nthese patients may require a more individualized approach to treatment \nbased upon comorb id conditions and tolerance of planned therapy.  \nResponse Assessment  \nThe disease response criteria recommended by the NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel  are based on the INRC, which were revised in \n2017 based on the availability of modern imaging modalities and new PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

See the treatment algorithm for the specific \nrequirements regarding timing of resp onse, as these differ across risk \ngroups.  \nResponse assessment in the primary tumor site or metastatic bone or \nsoft tissue should be based on RECIST criteria and functional imaging \n(anatomical and MIBG/FDG -PET).\n53,54 If either primary neuroblastoma \ntumors or metastatic bone or soft tissue lesions are not MIBG avid, or \nwhen MIBG imaging and anatomic imaging do not correlate, FDG -PET \nimaging  is recommended.  \nInterpretation of MIBG tumor uptake in metastatic bone or soft tissue is \nperformed by means of semiquantitative scoring of body segments. The \nmodified Curie score95 and the SIOPEN score57 are the two most \ncommonly used systems. In North America, the modified Curie score is \nused.  \nMIBG is considered more sensitive and specific than technetium -99m \n(99mTc)-based bone scintigraphy, which is no longer recommended for \nuse in response assessment in bone. Novel radiotracers for assessing \nresponse are in development . However, the Panel notes that at this time \nthere are insufficient data available to incorporate these  tracers  for \nroutine response assessment.  \nFor bone marrow response assessment, the Panel recommends using \nthe approach described by Burchill et al and included in the INRC  (based \non immunocytology and/or immunohistochemistry).35  \nThe definition of overall response is based on the combination of primary \ntumor, metastatic bone or soft tissue, and bone marrow responses.  For the complete neuroblastoma response assessment criteria  \nrecommended by the NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel , see Response \nAssessment  in the algorithm . \nDisease Surveillance \nAlthough outcomes have improved for patients with neuroblastoma, approximately half of patients with high- risk disease will still develop \nrelapsed or refractory disease.\n66 Treatment options for  those with \nrelapsed or refractory disease remain limited; recommendations for the \ntreatment of relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma will be addressed by \nthe NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel in a future iteration of the Guidelines.  \nClose surveillance of patients treated for neuroblastoma is essential to \ndetect disease progression and other side effects related to prior \ntreatment. Surveillance recommendations stratified by risk group are detailed below; see Disease Surveillance/Follow -up After Completion of \nTreatment  in the algorithm  for complete surveillance recommendations.  \nLow-Risk Disease  \nFor patients with low -risk neuroblastoma who did not receive any \ntreatment (observation only), the use of ultrasound for surveillance is recommended when clinically indicated and appropriate  (see Low-Risk \nDisease  in the algorithm ).  \nFor those with low -risk disease whose tumors were surgically resected, \nthe NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends cross -sectional imaging to \ndelineate new baseline disease status at least 1 month postoperatively  \n(see Low-Risk Disease  in the algorithm ). This is followed by a transition \nto ultrasound for surveillance if possible (~every 3 months for year 1, \nevery 6 to 12 months for years 2–3, and then as clinically indicated). \nCross -sectional imaging for surveillance may be required depending on \nthe location of the primary tumor.

In terms of laboratory studies, the Panel notes that urine \ncatecholamine levels are no longer included in the revised INRC.53 \nHowever, obtaining spot catecholamine testing can be considered during \nsurveillance, if levels were elevated at diagnosis.  \nIntermediate- Risk Disease  \nSurveillance recommendations for patients with intermediate- risk disease \nwere adapted from the ANBL0531 and ANBL1232 studies.28,75 For \npatients who were treated for intermediate- risk disease, the NCCN Panel \nrecommends an interim H&P approximately every 3 months for y ear 1, \nevery 6 months for year 2, and then annually for y ears 3 through 5. \nAudiologic assessment should be considered depending on the degree \nof exposure to ototoxic agents. CBC with differential is recommended at the same frequency as imaging if bone marrow was involved at \ndiagnosis. Creatinine should be assessed every 6 mont hs for year 1, \nthen annually for years 2  and 3, and then as clinically indicated. Thyroid \nfunction can also be impacted by neuroblastoma treatment. Thyroid \nstudies including thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) are recommended \nannually through year 3, and then as clinically indicated. The Panel \nrecommends including free T4 analysis if TSH is abnormal. Like \nsurveillance in patients with low -risk disease, urine catecholamine levels \nare no longer recommended as part of INRC .\n53 However, obtaining spot \ncatecholamine levels can be considered during surveillance if elevated at \ndiagnosis.  \nIf the treatment endpoint has been achieved in patients with \nintermediate- risk disease, the NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel recommends \nan MIBG scan as part of the end -of-therapy evaluation. For patients with \nMIBG- avid tumors and INRG stage M disease at diagnosis, a 123I-MIBG \nscan with SPECT is recommended, if available, while imaging by FDG -\nPET is recommended for patients with MIBG  non-avid tumors. If either \nMIBG or FDG -PET scan was positive at diagnosis and at completion of therapy, these studies  should be obtained until a negative scan is \nachieved or the patient is 36 months from completion of therapy. This should be done every 3 to 6 months in y ear 1, annually in years 2 and 3, \nand then as clinically indicated.  \nThe Panel also recommends CT or MRI cross -sectional imaging of the \nprimary site approximately every 3 months for year 1, then every 6 \nmonths for y ear 2, followed by annually for year 3, and then as clinically \nindicated.  \nHigh -Risk Disease  \nSurveillance recommendations for high- risk disease were adapted from \nthe ANBL0532 and ANBL1531 studies.\n73,96 For patients who were treated \nfor high-risk disease, the NCCN Neuroblastoma Panel  recommends that \nH&P be performed  approximately every 3 months for y ear 1, then every \n6 months for years 2 through 5. The NCCN Panel strongly recommends \naudiologic assessment annually for 5 years , and then as clinically \nindicated, as studies have suggested that high rates of severe ototoxicity \n(requiring hearing aids) are  seen in survivors of high- risk \nneuroblastoma.97 CBC with differential is recommended at the same \nfrequency as imaging. Assessment of electrolytes (including Ca++, PO4, and Mg++) , as well as creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and \nbilirubin , are recommended every 3 months for year 1, followed by every \n6 months for years 2 and 3, and then annually for years 4 and 5. Thyroid \nstudies including TSH should be done every 6 months for years 1 and 2, \nand then annually for years 3 through 5. The Panel recommends \nincluding free T4 analysis if TSH is abnormal.  \nDepending on total anthracycline dose and radiation dose administered \nwith potential impact to the heart (and if normal at the end of therapy), an \nechocardiogram should be obtained every 2  to 5 years  if normal at the \nend of therapy , as cardiotoxicity is a known late effect in patients with \nhigh- risk neuroblastoma.\n66,98 See the Monitoring for Late Effects  Related \nto Neuroblastoma Treatment  section  below .

Monitoring for late effects is becoming \nincreasingly important,  especially as survival outcomes for patients with \nhigh- risk neuroblastoma who receive multimodality therapy continue to improve.\n6 Monitoring should be done at each follow -up visit. Typically, \nmonitoring for late effects as a component of survivorship follow -up starts \n2 or more years after completion of systemic therapy. The NCCN \nNeuroblastoma Panel strongly recommends that a personalized \nsurvivorship care plan be developed for each patient. Generalized \nrecommendations for screening for late effects in those with neuroblastoma would not be appropriate for many patients.  \nPatients with high -risk neuroblastoma (especially those treated with \nmyeloablative therapy) are at particularly high risk of hearing impairment, \nendocrine deficiencies, and growth retardation.\n66,98,100,101 Additional late \neffects common to those with high- risk disease include chronic kidney \ndisease, impaired fertility, cardiotoxicity, neurocognitive impairment, and \nsecond malignant neoplasms ( SMNs ).99,100  \nAn analysis of the retrospective Childhood Cancer Survivor Study \n(CCSS) found that survivors of high -risk neuroblastoma were at higher \nrisk of late morbidity and mortality compared with those treated for \nintermediate-  or low -risk disease.102 All-cause mortality was higher \nacross all risk groups, and the risk for SMNs  was higher among survivors \nof high -risk and intermediate -risk disease. Individuals treated for high -\nrisk neuroblastoma were also at higher risk of grade 3 to 5 chronic health \nconditions compared to their siblings.  \nPatients who receive chemotherapy for non– high-risk disease typically \nreceive lower cumulative doses of chemotherapeutic agents and limited \nor no EBRT ; therefore, these patients are at lower risk of long -term \ntoxicities compared to those with high -risk disease. However, patients \nwith non– high-risk disease constitute a heterogeneous group, and there \nis a wide range of cumulative chemotherapeutic exposure s. The NCCN \nNeuroblastoma Panel recommends consulting the COG Survivorship Guidelines for appropriate screening and counseling related to thyroid, \ncardiac, pulmonary, renal, bone, reproductive health, SMNs (with special \nattention to thyroid and kidney), and other treatment -associated late PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version 1.2025 \nNeuroblastoma   \n \n MS-20 effects for patients who received treatment for non– high- risk \nneuroblastoma.103 \nIt has been reported that many patients with neuroblastoma who receive \nplatinum -based chemotherapy experience ototoxicity.98 Hearing loss is \nalso a reported side effect of eflornithine treatment, with 13% of patients experiencing new or worsening hearing loss after initiation of eflornithine.\n94 Screening for sensorineural hearing loss in patients who \nare treated with platinum chemotherapy and eflornithine is of particular \nimportance to minimize delays in speech and language development, \nwhich in turn can impact academic performance and social development. While the COG Survivorship Guidelines outline the minimum \nrecommended frequency for audiologic assessment, the NCCN \nNeuroblastoma Panel recommends a referral to institutional audiology \nand/or otolaryngology teams for children with impaired heari ng to \ndetermine the appropriate schedule for subsequent evaluations.\n103  \nFertility preservation is an option for some patients with high -risk \ndisease. When possible, referral to fertility specialists for further \ndiscussion is recommended prior to initiation of chemotherapy.  \nSee Monitoring for Late Effects  in the algorithm  for complete \nrecommendations.  \nSummary  \nThe NCCN Guidelines for Neuroblastoma were  developed by a \nmultidisciplinary panel and provide recommendations for the initial \ndiagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of neuroblastoma based on \nclinical evidence and consensus. The recommended strategies for treating newly diagnosed neuroblastoma will continue to evolve based on emerging  data from clinical trials. The NCCN Guidelines for \nNeuroblastoma will be updated on an annual basis as relevant data become available. Treatment recommendations for relapsed/refractory \nneuroblastoma will be addressed in a future iteration.  \n \n PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:51:26 PM.
