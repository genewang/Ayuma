It has been replaced with specific imaging modalities (eg, CT , \nMRI, bone scan).\n• Footnote removed from algorithm pages: Because of the increased sensitivity and specificity of PSMA-PET tracers for detecting micrometastatic disease compared to \nconventional imaging (eg, CT, bone scan) at both initial staging and BCR, the panel does not feel that conventional imaging is a necessary prerequisite to PSMA-PET \nand that PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI can serve as an equally effective, if not more effective frontline imaging tool for these patients.  \n• Footnotes regarding use of biosimilars for specific regimens have been replaced by the general footnote: An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for \nany recommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines.\n• F-18 fluciclovine has been removed from the Guidelines.\nPROS-1\n• Workup for regional or metastatic prostate cancer, bullet 2 modified: Perform bone and soft tissue  imaging for staging\n• Footnote removed: Bone imaging can be achieved by conventional technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scan.

See Principles of Imaging (PROS-E) and Discussion.\n• Footnote nnn added: PARP inhibitors with or without novel hormone therapy have different biomarker and previous treatment requirements. See Principles of Non-\nHormonal Systemic Therapy (PROS-L).\n• Footnote ooo modified: Niraparib plus abiraterone (combination tablet) is a treatment option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation \n(germline and/or somatic) who have not yet had treatment in the setting of mCRPC, depending on prior treatment in other disease settings (PROS-16). Use of \nniraparib/abiraterone for those who have received prior novel hormone therapy is controversial because a benefit of this combination over use of a P ARP inhibitor \nalone has not been shown in this setting, but responses are likely. The fine-particle (category 2B; other recommended option) or standard  formulation of abiraterone \ncan be given with single-agent niraparib as a substitute for the combination niraparib/abiraterone tablet (category 2B; other recommended option) . (Language also \nchanged on PROS-L [4 of 4]).\nPROS-16A (continued)\n• Footnote removed: Talazoparib plus enzalutamide is a treatment option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in an HRR gene \n(BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, ATR, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, MLH1, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, or RAD51C) who have not yet had treatment in the setting of CRPC, depending \non prior treatment in other disease settings (PROS-16). There may be heterogeneity of response based on the specific gene mutation (Discussion). Use of talazoparib/\nenzalutamide for those who have received prior novel hormone therapy is controversial because a benefit of this combination over use of a P ARP inhibitor alone has \nnot been shown in this setting, but responses are likely.\n• Footnote removed: The noted category applies only if there are no visceral metastases.\n• Footnote removed: Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m² plus carboplatin AUC 4 mg/mL per min with growth factor support can be considered for fit patients with aggressive variant \nprostate cancer (ie, visceral metastases, low PSA and bulky disease, high LDH, high CEA, lytic bone metastases, NEPC histology) or unfavorable genomics (defects \nin at least 2 of PTEN, TP53, and RB1). Corn PG, et al. Lancet Oncol 2019;20:1432-1443.\n• Footnote removed: Olaparib is a treatment option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in a HRR gene (BRCA1, BRCA2, \nATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L) who have been treated previously with androgen receptor-\ndirected therapy. However, efficacy appears to be driven by the cohort of patients with at least one alteration in BRCA2, BRCA1, or ATM, and in particular by patients \nwith BRCA2 or BRCA1 mutations based on exploratory gene-by-gene analysis. There may be heterogeneity of response to olaparib for non-BRCA mutations based on \nthe specific gene mutation (Discussion).\n• Footnote removed: Other secondary hormone therapies include abiraterone, fine-particle abiraterone, and enzalutamide for patients with disease progression on \nprior novel hormone therapy. In addition, switching from prednisone or methylprednisolone to dexamethasone 1 mg/day can be considered for patients with disease \nprogression on either formulation of abiraterone. Also see Principles of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (PROS-G).\n• Footnote removed: Rucaparib is a treatment option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been \ntreated with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy . If the patient is not fit for chemotherapy, rucaparib can be considered even if \ntaxane-based therapy has not been given.\n• Footnote removed: Olaparib with abiraterone is an option for patients with a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA1 mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have not yet \nreceived a novel hormone therapy and who have not yet had treatment in the setting or CRPC.\nPROS-AUpdates in Version 1.2025 of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer from Version 4.2024 include:\nContinued\nUPDATESPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2020;106:116-123).\n• Footnote d, sentence 1 added: EBRT to whole prostate 2.2 Gy x 35 fx plus micro-boost to MRI-dominant lesion to ≤95 Gy (fractions ≤2.7 Gy).\nPROS-I (6 of 8)\n• Post-Prostatectomy Radiation Therapy\n\u0017Bullet 3, sentence removed: The panel recommends consultation with the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)/American Urological Association (AUA) \nGudielines.\n\u0017Bullet 4 modified: Typical prescribed doses for adjuvant RT or secondary post-prostatectomy RT for rising PSA are 64–72 Gy in standard fractionation. Biopsy-proven \nand/or imaging-defined gross recurrence may require higher doses.Notably , randomized trial data for those without gross evident disease demonstrated no benefit \nbut higher physician-reported toxicity with dose escalation for 70 Gy versus 64 Gy. Treatment volumes and OAR tolerances thus should be carefully considered and \nprioritized. Hypofractionated post-prostatectomy RT to the prostate fossa alone is supported by toxicity and outcome equipoise in post-hoc evaluation of the  remains \nunder prospective study with data from large studies such as RADICALS-RT trial (52.5 Gy/20 fractions vs. 64 Gy/32 fractions  66 Gy/33 fractions) and in the 2-year \nreport of the NRG GU003 trial (62.5 Gy/25 fractions vs. 66.6 Gy/37 fractions). However , the Panel notes that these regimens have shorter follow-up than historically \nstudied conventionally fractionated regimens and a relative paucity of data for simultaneous integrated treatment of the pelvic lymph nodes.  suggesting no excess \ntoxicity in post hoc comparison for at least fossa alone treatment. \nPROS-J (1 of 2)\n• Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection\n\u0017Bullets have been reordered.\n\u0017Bullet 1 added: For patients undergoing RP:\n ◊Sub-bullet 1 added: Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) can be considered in patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer .\n ◊Sub-bullet 2 added: PLND is recommended in patients wtih unfavorable intermediate, high, very-high-risk, and regional prosate cancer .\nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

OS was improved with the use of enzalutamide over first-generation antiandrogen regardless of the \naddition of docetaxel. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia associated with docetaxel use (6% in both groups), fatigue (1% in the \ncontrol group vs. 6% in the enzalutamide group), and hypertension (6% vs. 10%). The incidence of grade 1–3 memory impairment was 4% versus 13%.\nPROS-L (3 of 4)\n• PARP Inhibitors With or Without Novel Hormone Therapies\n\u0017Sub-bullet 1 added: Loss of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be especially associated with response to PARP inhibitor therapy compared to other HRR gene alterations.\n\u0017Sub-bullet 2, sentence 2 added: Efficacy appears to be driven by the cohort of patients with at least one alteration in BRCA2, BRCA1, or ATM, and in particular \nby patients with BRCA2 or BRCA1 mutations based on exploratory gene-by-gene analysis. There may be heterogeneity of response to olaparib for non-BRCA \nmutations based on the specific gene mutation (Discussion).\n\u0017Sub-bullet 3 modified: Rucaparib is an option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been \ntreated with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy based on results from a phase 2 trial. Results from the confirmatory  randomized \nphase 3 trial that showed that the median duration of imaging-based PFS was significantly longer in the group that received rucaparib than in those who received \na control medication (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or docetaxel). In the pre-docetaxel setting, rucaparib is a preferred option for patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 \nmutations. If the patient is not fit for chemotherapy, rucaparib can be considered even if taxane-based therapy has not been given.  Adverse events that may \noccur with rucaparib include anemia (including that requiring transfusion),fatigue, asthenia, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea  or constipation, \nthrombocytopenia, neutropenia, increased creatinine, increased liver transaminases, and rash. Rare but serious side effects of rucaparib include a theoretical risk of \nmyelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia, as well as fetal teratogenicity.\n\u0017Sub-bullet 4 modified: Olaparib with abiraterone is an option for certain patients with mCRPC (PROS-16) and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (germline \nand/or somatic) who have not yet received a novel hormone therapy and who have not yet had treatment in the setting of CRPC  based on results of an international, \ndouble-blind, phase 3 trial. Imaging-based PFS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the placebo group. The \nsafety profile of the olaparib/abiraterone combination was as expected based on the known safety profiles of the individual drugs, with the most common adverse \nevents being anemia, fatigue/asthenia, and nausea.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

See \nNCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection . Active surveillance is \nrecommended for this subset of patients.\nn Active surveillance involves actively monitoring the course of disease with the \nexpectation to intervene with potentially curative therapy if the cancer progresses. \nSee Principles of Active Surveillance and Observation (PROS-F) .\no Confirmatory testing can be used to assess the appropriateness of active \nsurveillance (PROS-F 2 of 5). If higher grade and/or higher T stage is found during \nconfirmatory testing, see PROS-2.\np Observation involves monitoring the course of disease with the expectation \nto deliver palliative therapy for the development of symptoms or a change in \nexamination or PSA that suggests symptoms are imminent. See Principles of \nActive Surveillance and Observation (PROS-F) .\nq Criteria for progression are not well-defined and require physician judgment; \nhowever, a change in risk group strongly implies disease progression. See \nDiscussion .\nr The Panel recognizes that there is heterogeneity across the low-risk group, and \nthat some factors may be associated with an increased probability of near-term \ngrade reclassification, including high PSA density, a high number of positive cores \n(eg, ≥3), high genomic risk (from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis), and/or a \nknown BRCA2 germline mutation. In some of these cases, upfront treatment with \nRP or prostate RT may be preferred based on shared decision-making with the \npatient. See Principles of Active Surveillance and Observation (PROS-F) .\ns Principles of Radiation Therapy (PROS-I).\nt Principles of Surgery (PROS-J).u RTOG-ASTRO (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group - American Society for \nRadiation Oncology) Phoenix Consensus: 1) PSA increase by ≥2 ng/mL above the \nnadir PSA is the standard definition for PSA recurrence after external beam RT \n(EBRT) with or without hormone therapy; and 2) a recurrence evaluation should \nbe considered when PSA has been confirmed to be increasing after radiation even \nif the increase above nadir is <2 ng/mL, especially in candidates for secondary \nlocal therapy who are young and healthy. Retaining a strict version of the ASTRO \ndefinition allows comparison with a large existing body of literature. Rapid increase \nof PSA may warrant evaluation (prostate biopsy) prior to meeting the Phoenix \ndefinition, especially in patients who are younger or healthier.\nv PSA persistence/recurrence after RP is defined as when PSA does not fall to \nundetectable levels (PSA persistence) or undetectable PSA after RP with a \nsubsequent detectable PSA that increases on ≥2 determinations (PSA recurrence) \nor increases to PSA >0.1 ng/mL. Trials indicating non-inferiority of early RT \ncompared with adjuvant RT after RP have used a PSA threshold of 0.1 or 0.2 \nng/mL to trigger treatment. Imaging and treatment at lower PSA levels may be \nappropriate in patients at high risk for progression based on pretreatment risk \nfactors, pathologic parameters, timing of recurrence, and genomic classifier (GC) \nscore, among other factors. \nw Adverse laboratory/pathologic features include: positive margin(s), seminal \nvesicle invasion, extracapsular extension, or detectable PSA.\nx Particular consideration to active surveillance may be appropriate for those \npatients in the favorable intermediate-risk group with a low percentage of Gleason \npattern 4 cancer, low tumor volume, low PSA density, and/or low genomic \nrisk (from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis). See Principles of Active \nSurveillance and Observation (PROS-F) .\ny Active surveillance of unfavorable intermediate and high-risk clinically localized \ncancers is not recommended in patients with a life expectancy >10 years \n(category 1).\nz For details on the use of ADT and other hormonal agents, see Principles of \nAndrogen Deprivation Therapy (PROS-G) and Discussion .\naa The fine-particle formulation of abiraterone can be used instead of the standard \nform (category 2B; other recommended option).\nbb  RP + pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) can be considered in patients who are \nyounger and healthier without tumor fixation to the pelvic sidewall.\ncc Monitoring is not preferred for patients with multiple high-risk features. \ndd There is limited evidence that RP + PLND is beneficial in the setting of node-\npositive disease. Use of this approach should be limited to patients with >10-year \nlife expectancy and resectable disease and should be used in the context of a \nclinical trial or planned multimodality approach.

Risk assessment for treatment-related bone loss should take \nplace for all patients initiating ADT of any duration. Fracture risk can be assessed \nusing the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX), the algorithm released by The \nUniversity of Sheffield (https://frax.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/). FRAX was developed to \nestimate the 10-year probability of hip fracture or major osteoporotic fractures \ncombined (hip, spine, shoulder, or wrist) for an untreated individual using easily \nobtainable clinical risk factors for fracture with or without information on bone \nmineral density. When utilizing the FRAX algorithm select YES for secondary \nosteoporosis for individuals with hypogonadism. ADT should be considered \n“secondary osteoporosis” when using the FRAX algorithm. A previous major \nosteoporotic fracture (hip fracture or spine fracture) is considered clinical \nosteoporosis and warrants bone antiresorptive drug therapy independent of bone \nmineral density.\n• A baseline dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan should be obtained \nbefore starting ADT in patients at increased risk for fracture based on FRAX \nscreening and being considered for antiresorptive therapy (see Table 1). For \npatients at low risk of fracture based on the FRAX risk assessment, baseline DEXA \nscan can be omitted. The exact FRAX fracture risk threshold has not been defined \nin this population. One approach is to set the threshold at 10-year risk of major \nosteoporotic fracture (calculated without DEXA) greater than that of a 65-year old \nwhite woman with no additional risk factors (defined as 8.4% in the United States).  \n• Treatment for osteoporosis is advised according to guidelines for the general \npopulation from the Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation.1 These guidelines \n(see Table 1) include recommendations for: 1) calcium (1000–1200 mg daily from \nfood, with supplements if intake is insufficient); 2) vitamin D3 (serum levels of \n30–50 ng/mL with supplements prescribed if needed); and 3) pharmacologic \ntreatment for men aged ≥50 years with low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and \n-2.5, osteopenia) at the femoral neck or total hip by DEXA scan with a 10-year \nprobability of hip fracture ≥3% or a 10-year probability of a major osteoporosis-\nrelated fracture ≥20% based on FRAX screening (see Table 2). • Antiresorptive medications that increase bone mineral density \nand reduce disease-related skeletal complications during ADT for \nprostate cancer include denosumab (60 mg subcutaneously [SQ] \nevery 6 months), zoledronic acid (5 mg IV annually), and alendronate \n(70 mg PO weekly) (see Table 2). Treatment with either denosumab, \nzoledronic acid, or alendronate sodium is recommended when the \nabsolute fracture risk warrants drug therapy.\n\u0017Choice of agent may depend on underlying comorbidities, whether \nthe patient has been treated with zoledronic acid previously, \nlogistics, and/or cost considerations.\n\u0017Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid or alendronate) can cause \nside effects of acute phase reaction, joint pain, hypocalcemia, \nosteonecrosis of the jaw, nephrotoxicity with need for dose \nmodification for renal insufficiency, ocular toxicities, and atypical \nfemoral fractures with prolonged use (>3–5 years).\n\u0017Denosumab can cause side effects of hypocalcemia, osteonecrosis \nof the jaw, and atypical femoral fractures with prolonged use. \nThe risk factors for denosumab-associated hypocalcemia include \nblastic bone metastases, renal impairment, vitamin D deficiency, \nthe lack of prophylactic supplementation of calcium and/or vitamin \nD, preexisting hypoparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia, and gastric \nbypass. Although renal monitoring is not required, denosumab \nis not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance <30 \nmL/min given risk of severe hypocalcemia. Calcium, creatinine, \nand vitamin D levels should be checked prior to initiating therapy. \nPeriodic monitoring of serum calcium levels is recommended \nwith denosumab use. Stopping denosumab therapy can result in \nrebound bone loss and fractures; therefore it is recommended \nto administer at least one dose of a potent bisphosphonate \n(zoledronic acid 4 or 5 mg) to prevent rebound bone loss and \npresumably rebound fracture.2\nContinuedReferences (PROS-B 4 of 4)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

T o prevent \nosteonecrosis of the jaw, it is recommended that all patients have a comprehensive dental evaluation prior to initiating an osteoclast inhibitor.3 If invasive \ndental procedures are required, bone-targeted therapy should be withheld until the dentist indicates that the patient has healed completely from all dental \nprocedure(s). Stopping denosumab represents a dilemma is this context, and the clinician must carefully weigh the risk of rebound spine fractures \nversus the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. \n• Annual assessment of fracture risk using the FRAX risk assessment tool is recommended for all patients on ADT or those who remain hypogonadal after \ncompletion of ADT (see Table 1).  Depending on the fracture risk and prior DEXA scan results, repeat DEXA scan in 1 to 2 years is recommended for those \npatients on ADT. For individuals initiated on antiresorptive therapy, a follow-up DEXA scan after 1 year of treatment is recommended by the International \nSociety for Clinical Densitometry, although there is no consensus on the optimal approach to monitoring the effectiveness of bone treatment. Use of \nbiochemical markers of bone turnover to monitor response to therapy is not recommended. There are currently no guidelines on how often to monitor \nvitamin D levels.\n• For patients receiving antiresorptive therapy, there are currently no consensus guidelines on duration of treatment. Due to concerns of long-term risks \nof antiresorptive therapy, a “drug holiday” at 3 to 5 years can be considered based on agent utilized, stability of bone mineral density, prior fracture \nhistory, and future fracture risk. Bone mineral density should be monitored approximately every 1 to 2 years after suspending therapy, and therapy should \ngenerally be resumed if bone mineral density declines significantly or if the patient develops a new fragility fracture .\nTable 1: Risk Assessment and Monitoring\nClinical Scenario Recommendation \nBaseline at ADT initiation DEXA recommended for most patients.

Initial studies investigated zoledronic acid and denosumab administered every 4 \nweeks. Subsequent studies demonstrated that every-12-week dosing of zoledronic acid compared to every-4-week dosing did not increase the risk of \nskeletal events.4,5 Every-12-week dosing of zoledronic acid is recommended for symptomatic SRE reduction when indicated. Every-12-week dosing of \ndenosumab is under investigation and current data suggest non-inferior symptomatic skeletal events compared to every-4-week dosing.5 Utilization of \nzoledronic acid and denosumab for symptomatic SRE reduction requires consideration of degree of benefit and risk associated with therapy to optimize \nuse, dose, and schedule. It is important to recognize that testing of zoledronic acid and denosumab in bone-metastatic CRPC was conducted during an \nera when treatment options for mCRPC were largely limited to docetaxel chemotherapy. Subsequent studies investigating abiraterone, enzalutamide, \ncabazitaxel, radium-223, and Lu-177–PSMA-617 have demonstrated improvement of SREs with treatment. While radium-223 did improve symptomatic \nSREs in patients with bone mCRPC, the combination of radium-223 with abiraterone was associated with increased frequency of bone fractures, \nparticularly in individuals not receiving an antiresorptive agent.6\n• A phase 3 clinical trial that assessed the role for zoledronic acid in patients with castration-sensitive disease beginning ADT for bone metastases was \nnegative.7 Therefore, use of osteoclast inhibitors for reduction of symptomatic SREs in metastatic castration-sensitive disease with bone metastases is \nnot recommended.

Cascade \ntesting for relatives is critical to inform the risk for familial cancers in all relatives.\n\u0017Post-test genetic counseling is recommended if positive family history but no pathogenic variant OR if only germline variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) are identified. This is to ensure accurate understanding of family implications and review indications for additional \ntesting and/or follow-up (including clinical trials of reclassification).\n\u0017Resources are available to review the available data supporting pathogenic consequences of specific variants (eg, https://www.ncbi.nlm.\nnih.gov/clinvar/ ; https://brcaexchange.org/about/app ).\n\u0017Individuals should be counseled to inform providers of any updates to family cancer history.\nPROS-C\n1 OF 2PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Clinical trials may \ninclude established and/or candidate molecular biomarkers for eligibility.\n\u0017Tumor molecular profiles may change with subsequent treatments and re-evaluation may be considered at time of cancer progression for \ntreatment decision-making.\n\u0017Patients should be informed that tumor molecular analysis by DNA  sequencing has the potential to uncover germline findings. \nConfirmatory germline testing may be recommended [see Post-test Considerations (below) and T umor Testing:s Potential Implications for \nGermline Testing in the Principles of Cancer Risk Assessment and Counseling (EVAL-A) in the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-\nRisk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic and Prostate ].\n• Testing\n\u0017Somatic testing for alterations in DNA damage response: \n ◊Multigene tumor testing for alterations in HRR genes, including but not limited to  BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D, \nCHEK2 , and CDK12 , is recommended in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. This testing can be considered in patients with regional \nprostate cancer.\n –Loss of BRCA1  and BRCA2  may be especially associated with response to PARP inhibitor therapy compared to other HRR gene \nalterations.\n ◊Tumor testing for MSI-H or dMMR is recommended in patients with mCRPC and may be considered in patients with regional or \ncastration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer.\n ◊TMB testing is recommended in patients with mCRPC.\n• Tumor Specimen and Assay Considerations\n\u0017The Panel strongly recommends a metastatic biopsy for histologic and molecular evaluation. This could include lymph node biopsy for \npatients with N1 disease. \n ◊When metastatic biopsy is unsafe or unfeasible, plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay is an option, preferably collected during \nbiochemical (PSA) and/or radiographic progression in order to maximize diagnostic yield.  When diagnostic yield is low, the risk of false \nnegatives is higher, so ctDNA collection is not recommended when PSA is undetectable. \n\u0017Caution is needed when interpreting ctDNA-only evaluation due to potential interference from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate \npotential (CHIP), which can result in a false-positive biomarker signal.\n\u0017DNA analysis for MSI and immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair (MMR) are different assays measuring different biological effects \ncaused by dMMR function. If MSI is used, testing using a next-generation sequencing assay validated for prostate cancer is preferred.\n• Post-test Considerations\n\u0017Post-test genetic counseling is recommended if pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant (mutation) identified in any gene that has clinical \nimplications if also identified in germline (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, HOXB13,  MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2).\n\u0017Post-test genetic counseling to assess for the possibility of Lynch syndrome is recommended if MSI-H or dMMR is found.PRINCIPLES OF GENETICS AND MOLECULAR/BIOMARKER ANALYSIS \nPROS-C\n2 OF 2PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

The provider should explain the likelihood of cure, recurrence, \ndisease progression, and disease-specific mortality with each management option, taking into account disease severity and competing \nrisks. In addition to the primary intended effects of treatment, the clinician should discuss the side effects of each treatment and predicted \nimpact on quality of life, including urinary, sexual, and bowel function. Patient preferences should be elicited and should be incorporated \ninto the disease management decision.6\nPROS-DReferences:\n1 Sanda MG, Dunn RL, Michalski J, et al.

Low- and intermediate-risk groups with low serum PSAs postoperatively have a \nvery low risk of positive bone scans or CT scans. \n• Frequency of imaging should be based on individual risk, age, PSADT, Gleason score, and overall health.\n• Bone scans are rarely positive in asymptomatic patients with PSA <10 ng/mL. The relative risk for bone metastasis or death increases as \nPSADT shortens. Bone imaging should be performed more frequently when PSADT is ≤8 months, where there appears to be an inflection \npoint.\nUltrasound\n• Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to image small regions of the body.\n\u0017Standard ultrasound imaging provides anatomic information.\n\u0017Vascular flow can be assessed using Doppler ultrasound techniques.\n• Endorectal ultrasound is used to guide transrectal biopsies of the prostate. Endorectal ultrasound can be considered for patients with \nsuspected recurrence after RP to guide prostate bed biopsy.\n• Advanced ultrasound techniques for imaging of the prostate and for differentiation between prostate cancer and prostatitis are under \nevaluation.\nPROS-E\n1 OF 4PRINCIPLES OF IMAGING\nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

However, new \nlesions seen on an initial post-treatment bone scan, compared to the \npretreatment baseline scan, may not indicate disease progression.\n• New lesions in the setting of a falling PSA or soft tissue response \nand in the absence of pain progression at that site may indicate \nbone scan flare or an osteoblastic healing reaction. For this \nreason, a confirmatory bone scan 8–12 weeks later is warranted \nto determine true progression from flare reaction. Additional new \nlesions favor progression. Stable scans make continuation of \ntreatment reasonable. Bone scan flare is common, particularly on \ninitiation of new hormonal therapy, and may be observed in nearly half of patients treated with the newer agents, enzalutamide and \nabiraterone. Similar flare phenomena may exist with other imaging \nmodalities, such as CT or PET/CT imaging.\n• Bone scans and soft tissue imaging (CT or MRI) in patients with \nmetastatic or non-metastatic prostate cancer may be obtained \nregularly during systemic therapy to assess clinical benefit. \n• Bone scans should be performed for symptoms and as often as \nevery 6–12 months to monitor ADT. The need for soft tissue images \nremains unclear. In CRPC, 8- to 12-week imaging intervals appear \nreasonable. \n• Plain Radiography\n\u0017Plain radiography can be used to evaluate symptomatic regions in \nthe skeleton. However, plain films will not detect a bone lesion until \nnearly 50% of the mineral content of the bone is lost or gained.\n\u0017CT or MRI may be more useful to assess fracture risk as \nthese modalities permit more accurate assessment of cortical \ninvolvement than plain films where osteoblastic lesions may \nobscure cortical involvement. \nSoft Tissue Imaging\n• Soft tissue imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest can include:\n\u0017Chest CT and abdomen/pelvis CT or abdomen/pelvis MRI or\n\u0017PSMA-PET/CT or PSMA-PET/MRI for bone and soft tissue (full \nbody) imaging.\n• Computed Tomography\n\u0017CT provides a high level of anatomic detail, and may detect gross \nextracapsular disease, nodal metastatic disease, and/or visceral \nmetastatic disease. \n\u0017CT is generally not sufficient to evaluate the prostate gland.\n\u0017CT may be performed with IV contrast, and CT technique should be \noptimized to maximize diagnostic utility while minimizing radiation \ndose.\n\u0017CT can be used for examination of the pelvis and/or abdomen for \ninitial evaluation ( PROS-2) and as part of workup for recurrence or \nprogression (see PROS-10 through PROS-16). \nPROS-E\n2 OF 4PRINCIPLES OF IMAGING\nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

MRI-ultrasound fusion \nbiopsy may improve the detection of higher grade (Grade Group \n≥2) cancers.\n\u0017Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) can be used in the staging and \ncharacterization of prostate cancer. mpMRI images are defined as \nimages acquired with at least one more sequence in addition to the \nanatomical T2-weighted images, such as DWI or dynamic contrast-\nenhanced (DCE) images. mpMRI may be used to better risk stratify \npatients who are considering active surveillance. Additionally, \nmpMRI may detect large and poorly differentiated prostate cancer \n(Grade Group ≥2) and detect extracapsular extension (T staging) \nand is preferred over CT for abdomen/pelvis staging. mpMRI has \nbeen shown to be equivalent to CT scan for pelvic lymph node \nevaluation.\nFull Body Imaging\n• Positron Emission Tomography\n\u0017PSMA-PET refers to a growing body of radiopharmaceuticals that \ntarget PSMA on the surface of prostate cells. There are multiple \nPSMA radiopharmaceuticals at various stages of investigation. At this time, the NCCN Guidelines only recommend the currently \nFDA-approved PSMA agents: F-18 piflufolastat PSMA (also known \nas F-18 DCFPyL), F-18 flotufolastat PSMA (also known as rh-\nPSMA-7.3), and Ga-68 PSMA-11. Throughout these Guidelines, \n“PSMA-PET” refers to any of these FDA-approved PSMA ligands. \nSee Table 2 in the Discussion section for more details. \n\u0017F-18 flotufolastat PSMA is a PET imaging agent that is part \nof a class of tracers referred to as radiohybrid (rh) ligands. \nThese tracers have two binding sites for radionuclides for both \nimaging and treatment, but the significance of this remains to be \ndetermined. \n\u0017PSMA-PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered as an alternative \nto CT, MRI, and bone scans for initial staging, the detection of \nbiochemically recurrent disease, and as workup for progression. \n\u0017Synthesis of Ga-68 PSMA-11 requires that the PSMA-11 ligand is \nlabeled with Ga-68 from a generator or cyclotron. Two commercial \nkits to perform this in nuclear pharmacies have been approved by \nthe FDA.\n\u0017C-11 choline PET/CT or PET/MRI may be used to detect small-\nvolume recurrent disease in soft tissues and in bone.\n\u0017Studies suggest that PSMA-PET imaging has a higher sensitivity \nthan C-11 choline PET imaging, especially at very low PSA levels. \n\u0017Because of the increased sensitivity and specificity of PSMA-PET \ntracers for detecting micrometastatic disease compared to CT, MRI, \nand bone scan at both initial staging and BCR, PSMA-PET/CT or \nPSMA-PET/MRI can serve as a more effective frontline imaging tool \nfor these patients.\n\u0017Histologic or radiographic confirmation of involvement detected \nby PET imaging is recommended whenever feasible due to \nthe presence of false positives. Although false positives exist, \nliterature suggests that these are outweighed by the increase in \ntrue positives detected by PET relative to CT, MRI, and bone scans. \nTo reduce the false-positive rate, physicians should consider the \nintensity of PSMA-PET uptake and correlative CT findings in the \ninterpretation of scans. Several reporting systems have been \nproposed but will not have been validated or widely used.\n\u0017PSMA imaging should be done before initiation of ADT because \nPROS-E\n3 OF 4PRINCIPLES OF IMAGING\nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

As an example, F-18 sodium fluoride PET/\nCT may categorize some patients as M1b who would have been \ncategorized previously as M0 using a bone scan (stage migration). \nAbsent any change in the effectiveness of therapy, the overall \nsurvival (OS) of both M1b and M0 groups would improve. The \ndefinition of M0 and M1 disease for randomized clinical trials \nthat added docetaxel or abiraterone to ADT was based on CT and \nradionuclide bone scans. Results suggest that OS of M1 disease \nis improved, whereas progression-free but not  OS of M0 disease \nis improved. Therefore, a subset of patients now diagnosed with \nM1 disease using F-18 sodium fluoride PET/CT might not benefit \nfrom the more intensive therapy used in these trials and could \nachieve equivalent OS from less intensive therapy aimed at M0 \ndisease. Carefully designed clinical trials using proper staging \nwill be necessary to prove therapeutic benefit, rather than making \nassumptions compromised by stage migration.\u0017Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT should not be used routinely \nfor staging prostate cancer since data are limited in this setting.\n\u0017F-18 FDG-PET has been shown to be prognostic in patients with \nprogressive CRPC.1,2\n\u0017The increasing use of PSMA-PET has identified the potential for \nconsiderable biological diversity among disease foci within a given \nindividual with prostate cancer, especially mCRPC, and that this \nheterogeneity can be detected with a combination of PSMA-PET \nand FDG-PET. Initial data suggest that metastases with PSMA-\nnegative/FDG-positive mismatches may exist in patients with \nmCRPC undergoing Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy and that patients \nwith these mismatches may have worse outcomes. Currently, no \nrobust clinical trial data exist to support the incorporation of FDG-\nPET into routine clinical use alongside PSMA-PET. To overcome \nthe limitations of PSMA-PET in PSMA-negative metastatic disease, \nthe Panel currently recommends the use of contrast-enhanced \nCT or MRI in these patients, as the non-contrast CT component of \nPSMA-PET/CT is insufficient to detect visceral metastatic disease.\nImaging as Workup for Progression\n• Workup for progression should include bone and soft tissue \nevaluation.\n\u0017See Bone Imaging ( PROS-E [2 of 4]).\n\u0017See Soft Tissue Imaging ( PROS-E [2 of 4]).\n• Imaging for patients with progressive mCRPC should include \nchest CT, bone imaging, and abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast or \nabdomen/pelvis MRI with and without contrast.

The Prostate Cancer Panel recommends that \npatients and their physicians carefully consider active surveillance based on the patient’ s prostate cancer risk profile and estimated life \nexpectancy. In settings where the patient’s age and comorbidities suggest a shorter life expectancy, observation may be more appropriate. \nShared decision-making, after appropriate counseling on the risks and benefits of the various options, is critical.\nACTIVE SURVEILLANCE1\n• Active surveillance involves actively monitoring the course of disease with the expectation to intervene with curative intent if the cancer \nprogresses.\n• Life Expectancy:\n\u0017Life expectancy is a key determinant for the choice between observation, active surveillance, and definitive treatment.\n\u0017Consider incorporating a validated metric of comorbidity such as the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 Index (ACE-27)2 to differentiate \nbetween recommendations for observation versus active surveillance. Prior studies did not incorporate a validated metric of comorbidity \nto estimate life expectancy (Table 1 on PROS-F 4 of 5) , which is a potential limitation when interpreting the data for a patient who is in \nexcellent health. \n\u0017Life expectancy can be challenging to estimate for individual patients (Principles of Life Expectancy Estimation, PROS-A) .\n• Candidacy for Active Surveillance:\n\u0017Active surveillance is preferred for patients with very-low-risk prostate cancer (Risk Group Criteria [PROS-2]) and a life expectancy ≥10 \nyears. (Observation is preferred for patients with a life expectancy <10 years and very-low-risk disease.)\n\u0017Active surveillance is preferred for most patients with low-risk prostate cancer (Risk Group Criteria [PROS-2]) and a life expectancy ≥10 \nyears. The Panel recognizes that there is heterogeneity across this risk group, and that some factors may be associated with an increased \nprobability of near-term grade reclassification including high PSA  density, a high number of positive cores (eg, ≥3), and high genomic risk \n(from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis).3 For some of these patients, upfront treatment with RP or prostate RT may be preferred \nbased on shared decision-making.\n\u0017Patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer (Risk Group Criteria [PROS-2]) and a life expectancy >10 years may also consider \nactive surveillance. Particular consideration for active surveillance may be appropriate for those patients with a low percentage of Gleason \npattern 4 cancer, low tumor volume, low PSA density, and/or low genomic risk (from tissue-based molecular tumor analysis). Active \nsurveillance is not recommended for patients with favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer and unfavorable histology (eg, expansile/\nlarge cribriform histology, intraductal carcinoma). See Discussion.\n\u0017Please see Table 1 (PROS-F 4 of 5)  for a summary of major active surveillance cohorts, including their inclusion criteria.\nPROS-F\n1 OF 5ContinuedReferences on PROS-F 5 of 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

See Principles of Risk Stratification and Biomarkers (PROS-H). Other forms of imaging are discouraged. \n\u0017Early confirmatory testing may not be necessary in patients who have had an mpMRI prior to diagnostic biopsy .\n\u0017All patients should undergo a confirmatory prostate biopsy within 1–2 years of their diagnostic biopsy .\n• Active Surveillance Program:\n\u0017Patients who choose active surveillance should have regular follow-up, and key principles include:\n ◊PSA no more often than every 6 months unless clinically indicated.\n ◊DRE no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated.\n ◊Repeat prostate biopsy no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated. While the intensity of surveillance may be \ntailored based on patient and tumor factors (eg, grade, tumor volume), most patients should have prostate biopsies every 2 to 5 years as \npart of their monitoring.\n ◊Consider repeat mpMRI no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated.\n ◊In patients with a suspicious lesion on mpMRI, MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy improves the detection of higher grade (Grade Group ≥2) \ncancers.\n ◊Patients should be transitioned to observation when life expectancy is <10 years.\n ◊Repeat molecular tumor analysis is discouraged.\n ◊The intensity of surveillance may be tailored based on patient life expectancy and risk of reclassification.\n◊ A metastatic staging evaluation (PSMA PET, bone scan, CT scan, or whole body MRI) should not be performed.\n• Considerations for Treatment of Patients on Active Surveillance:\n\u0017Grade reclassification on repeat biopsy is the most common factor influencing a change from active surveillance to treatment.\n\u0017Other factors affecting decisions to actively treat include: increase in tumor volume, a rise in PSA  density, and patient anxiety.\n\u0017Considerations for a change in disease management strategy should be made in the context of the patient’s life expectancy.\n• Advantages of Active Surveillance:\n\u0017Between 50% and 68% of those eligible for active surveillance may safely avoid treatment for at least 10 years.4-6\n\u0017Patients will avoid possible side effects of definitive therapy that may be unnecessary while on active surveillance.\n\u0017Quality of life/normal activities will be less affected while on active surveillance.\n\u0017Risk of unnecessary treatment of small, indolent cancers will be reduced.\nContinuedReferences on PROS-F 5 of 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Consider \nincorporating a validated metric of comorbidity (see Life Expectancy, PROS-F 1 of 5 ).\n• If patients under observation become symptomatic, an assessment of disease burden can be performed, and treatment or palliation can be \nconsidered (PROS-13).\n• Advantages of Observation:\n\u0017Patients will avoid possible side effects of unnecessary confirmatory testing and definitive therapy .\n• Limitations of Observation:\n\u0017There may be a risk of local or systemic symptoms (eg, urinary retention, pathologic fracture), without prior symptoms or concerning PSA  \nlevels.\nContinuedReferences on PROS-F 5 of 5PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

The optimal level of serum \ntestosterone to affect “castration” has yet to be determined. \n• Data are limited on long-term adherence to oral relugolix and the potential effects on optimal ADT. Ongoing monitoring for sustained \nsuppression of testosterone (<50 ng/dL) can be considered, and relugolix may not be a preferred agent if adherence to the prescribed \nregimen is uncertain. \n \nMonitor/Surveillance :\n• ADT has a variety of adverse effects, including hot flashes, loss of libido,  erectile dysfunction, shrinkage of penis and testicles, loss \nof muscle mass and strength, fatigue, anemia, breast enlargement and tenderness/soreness, depression and mood swings, hair loss, \nosteoporosis, greater incidence of clinical fractures, obesity, insulin resistance, alterations in lipids, and greater risk for diabetes and \ncardiovascular disease. The intensity and spectrum of these side effects vary greatly , and many are reversible or can be avoided or \nmitigated. See NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship .

However , they \nhave not been routinely reported in clinical trials. This limits the ability to provide evidence-based guideline treatment recommendations \nusing these methods. Thus, the NCCN Guidelines continue s to use NCCN categories and subgroups of risk as a framework. \n\u0017Clinical trials have established the benefit of various treatments in prostate cancer and have commonly enrolled patients across a \nspectrum of risk. Subgroup analyses, absolute benefit estimates, and expert opinion are used to provide treatment recommendations for \neach NCCN risk group or disease state.\n\u0017There is intrinsic heterogeneity in prognosis within a given NCCN category and subgroup. Thus, treatment recommendations for adjacent \nsubgroups or categories of risk may be appropriate when using additional risk stratification methods.\n\u0017The Panel acknowledges the ability to personalize treatment decisions through additional tools and have created this section to assist.\n• Tools that are prognostic or predictive in one disease state may not be in other disease states, or they may have other forms of clinical utility \nbeyond prognostication and prediction of treatment benefit. \n\u0017For example, germline homologous recombination deficiency ( HRD) mutations do not have an established prognostic or predictive role \nin localized prostate cancer, but specific HRD mutations have been demonstrated to have a prognostic and predictive role in advanced \ndisease. Additionally, the utility of germline testing extends to inform screening recommendations for other cancers and cascade germline \ntesting for family members. \n• Imaging is also a biomarker (ie, MRI, PSMA-PET/CT) and can aid in risk stratification.

For clarity these tools are separated by \ntype and category:\n\u0017Type:\n ◊Standard Tools: These include clinical and/or pathologic variables routinely collected to assign a patient to an NCCN category and/or \nsubgroup. Examples include TNM stage, Grade Group, PSA, and metastatic volume of disease.\n ◊Clinical and Pathologic Tools: These include clinical and/or pathologic tools that are generally derived from standard tools. Examples \ninclude multivariable models or nomograms, histologic variants, and PSA kinetics.\n ◊Advanced Tools: These involve an additional test above what is collected to assign an NCCN category or subgroup. These may include, \nbut are not limited to, germline or somatic tests, gene expression tests, digital histopathology-based tests, imaging, and circulating \nmarkers.\n\u0017Category:\n ◊Prognostic: Discriminates the risk of developing an oncologic endpoint (eg, distant metastasis). The relative benefit of a treatment (ie, the \ntreatment effect or hazard ratio) is generally similar across a prognostic spectrum, although the absolute benefit of an intervention may \nvary by risk (ie, number needed to treat [NNT]).\n –Ideally, prognostic biomarkers independently discriminate and are associated with a clinically meaningful endpoint above and beyond \nstandard tools relevant to that disease setting that ultimately helps guide a therapeutic decision.\n ◊Predictive: Discriminates a difference in the relative benefit of a specific treatment for an oncologic endpoint.\n –Ideally, predictive biomarkers have been demonstrated to measure a biomarker-treatment interaction that ultimately helps guide a \ntherapeutic decision in the context of a randomized trial, specifically randomizing the treatment of interest. \nContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Thus, while some of these tools may have value, these \nlimitations hinder the ability to accurately provide guidance to specific treatment recommendations with confidence.\n• A comprehensive list of these tools is outside the scope of this guideline.\n\u0017Examples of such prognostic tools include multivariable models and nomograms (ie, CAPRA,1 STAR-CAP,2 MSKCC nomograms3), \nhistopathology (ie, cribriform, intraductal carcinoma, percent Gleason pattern 4, total mm of cancer), and clinical variables (ie, PSA  density, \nPSA velocity, PSA level, PSADT).\nAdvanced Tools:\n• There are advanced tools that have demonstrated superior prognostic performance beyond standard tools and/or serve as a predictive \nbiomarker that identifies patients who will differentially benefit from a specific treatment. \n• These tools are an additional test that must be ordered, and thus are only recommended to be used when they have the potential ability to \nchange management and should not be ordered reflexively.\n• These tools are not recommended for patients with very-low-risk prostate cancer.\n• There are an extensive number of these tools created with substantial variability in quality of reporting and model design, endpoint selection, \nand quality and caliber of validation. It is recommended to use models that have robust validation, ideally with high-quality, long-term clinical \ntrial data, which usually comes from randomized trials and across multiple clinical trials. \n• Only advanced tools with Simon level of evidence of I,4 or specific alterations linked to FDA-approved treatments are shown in T able 1.\n\u0017A comprehensive list of advanced tools that do not reach the threshold of level I evidence is outside the scope of this guideline, but \nexamples of such tests include gene expression tests (ie, 31-gene assay [Prolaris] and 17-gene assay [Genomic Prostate Score]).\nContinuedReferences (PROS-H 7 of 7)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Patients receiving RT alone with low GC scores had 10-year DM rates of \n4%, compared with 16% for GC high risk.  \n \nEvidence synthesis: RT alone may be considered for patients with a low GC score and NCCN intermedi -\nate-risk disease. The addition of ST-ADT should be considered for patients with a high GC score given their \nincreased risk of DM and significant benefit of ST-ADT on DM, irrespective of RT dose or brachytherapy \nboost. \nNCCN High-Risk≤0.45 (low) vs. ≥0.60 \n(high)RT + ST-ADT\nvs.\nRT + LT-ADTEvidence: A meta-analysis of three phase III randomized trials (NRG/RTOG 9202, 9413, and 9902) were \nprofiled post-hoc with a prespecified analysis plan.6 The study demonstrated the independent prognostic \neffect of GC on biochemical failure, DM, MFS, PCSM, and OS. Patients with low GC scores had 10-year DM \nrates of 6%, compared with 26% for GC high risk. The absolute benefit of LT-ADT over ST-ADT was 11% for \npatients with high GC scores (NNT of 9), and 3% for patients with low GC scores (NNT of 33).\nEvidence synthesis: RT + LT-ADT should be recommended for most patients with NCCN high-risk disease \nregardless of the GC score outside of a clinical trial, irrespective of RT dose or brachytherapy boost. \nHowever, patients with a GC low-risk score should be counseled that the absolute benefit of LT-ADT over ST-\nADT is smaller than for patients with GC high-risk scores and when accounting for patient age, comorbidities, \nand patient preferences, it may be reasonable with shared decision-making to use a duration shorter than \nLT-ADT. \nPost-RP BCR<0.6 (low/intermediate) \nvs. ≥0.60 (high)cRT\nvs.\nRT + ADTEvidence: Two phase III randomized trials post-RP were profiled post-hoc with prespecified analysis plans. \nNRG/RTOG 9601 demonstrated the independent prognostic effect of GC on DM, PCSM, and OS, and found \nthat for patients with lower entry PSAs (<0.7 ng/mL), the 12-year DM rate benefit from hormone therapy for \npatients with GC lower risk vs. GC higher risk was 0.4% vs. 11.2%.12 The SAKK 09/10 phase III trial tested \npost-RP lower vs. higher dose RT alone. The study demonstrated the independent prognostic effect of GC \non biochemical progression, clinical progression, secondary hormone therapy, DM, and MFS.13\nEvidence synthesis: For patients with node-negative disease post-RP planned for early secondary RT (PSA \n≤0.5 ng/mL) with GC low or intermediate risk, use of RT alone should be considered. For patients planned for \nearly secondary RT with a GC high-risk tumor, use of secondary RT with ADT is recommended. At this time, \nit is unclear how best to use GC for patients receiving late post-RP secondary RT (PSA >0.5 ng/mL). Optimal \nADT duration (ie, 6 vs. 24 months) based on GC score is unknown at this time.\nContinued References (PROS-H 7 of 7)LT-ADT = long-term ADT; MFS = metastasis-free survival; NNT = number needed to treat; PCSS = prostate cancer-specific survival; ST-ADT = short-term ADT\nc SAKK 09/10 combined GC low and intermediate risk due to relatively similar prognosis. NRG/RTOG 9601 dichotomized patients by GC low versus intermediate and \nhigh risk. However, due to the age of the tissue from NRG/RTOG 9601 (>20 years old) there is a known shifting of GC scores, and a more contemporary distribution of \nscore distribution would approximate closer to combining GC low and intermediate risk together.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

In patients with biomarker-positive disease, ST-ADT significantly reduced the risk of DM \ncompared to RT alone (sHR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19–0.63; P < .001). There were no significant \ndifferences between treatment arms in the biomarker-negative subgroup (sHR = 0.92; 95% CI, \n0.59–1.43; P = .71).  \nEvidence synthesis: Patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer planning to receive RT, those \nwith biomarker-positive disease, and especially those with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease, \nshould be recommended for the addition of ST-ADT regardless of RT dose or type, notwithstanding \ncontraindications to ADT.

Selection of treatment approach should balance trade-offs in \nbiochemical disease control, toxicity, logistical burden for the patient, and patient preferences.\n• External Beam RT (EBRT) :\n\u0017Photon and proton RT are both forms of EBRT that appear to have generally comparable outcomes (toxicity, quality of life, and tumor control)\n(Discussion).\n\u0017The accuracy of EBRT should be verified by daily prostate localization to address interfraction setup uncertainty , with any of the following: techniques \nof image-guided RT (IGRT) using CT, MRI, ultrasound, implanted fiducials, or electromagnetic targeting/tracking. Endorectal balloons may be used to \nimprove prostate immobilization. Advanced image guidance with real-time intrafraction tracking may allow further precision for margin reduction and \nreduction in toxicity but requires quality validation. \n\u0017Biocompatible and biodegradable perirectal spacer materials may be implanted between the prostate and rectum in patients undergoing external \nradiotherapy with organ-confined prostate cancer in order to displace the rectum from high radiation dose regions for the purpose of toxicity reduction. \nPatients with grossly apparent posterior extraprostatic extension should not undergo perirectal spacer implantation. Marginal or suspected early \nextension is not a clear contraindication.\n\u0017Various fractionation and dose regimens can be considered depending on the clinical scenario ( Table 1 on PROS-I 4 of 8 ). Whole gland dose escalation \nimproves biochemical control while modestly increasing toxicity. Alternately, targeted dose escalation of imaging-defined (eg, MRI) intraprostatic \ndominant disease, using a simultaneous integrated micro-boost, improves biochemical disease control, without added toxicity when using an isotoxic \napproach that prioritizes normal organ  constraints over boost target coverage.1\n\u0017Stereotactic body RT (SBRT; also known as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, SABR) refers to a delivery of ultra-hypofractionated RT with high \nprecision treatment setup and image guidance techniques. SBRT is acceptable for treatment of primary prostate cancer across all risk groups and for \nlocoregional and/or distant metastases in practices with appropriate technology and expertise. Advanced imaging guidance with intrafraction tracking \nwhen using intensified doses and/or especially tight treatment margins should be considered when available and validated, based on data showing \nacute toxicity reduction. For primary site and/or regional nodal treatment with SBRT, simultaneous integrated boost for dosing of prostate, intraprostatic, \nseminal vesicle, and/or regional nodal targets to differing doses may be used. In select patients, SBRT to the prostate may also be used as a boost in \ncombination with fractionated EBRT. Based upon data for improved durability of disease control and pain reduction compared to historical palliative \nregimens, SBRT is recommended for metastasis-directed therapy in the following circumstances:  \n ◊In a patient with limited metastatic disease (eg, oligometastatic) when ablation is the goal. \n ◊In a patient with limited progression (eg, oligoprogression) or limited residual disease on otherwise effective systemic therapy (eg, consolidation) \nwhere progression-free survival (PFS) is the goal.\n ◊In a symptomatic patient where the lesion occurs in or immediately adjacent to a previously irradiated treatment field. \n ◊At physician discretion for more durable control of pain than achieved with typical palliative regimens used in some randomized trial data, which \nshould be considered particularly in prostate cancer where natural history of advanced disease can be very long. Regardless of SBRT or other \nplanning methods, hypofractionated palliative regimens are favored given long-established data for equivalent or superior pain control with \nminimization of logistical burden to patients.2,3\n• Biologically effective dose (BED) modeling with the linear-quadratic equation may not be accurate for ultra-hypofractionated (eg, SBRT) radiation.\nPROS-I\n1 OF 8ContinuedReferences PROS-I 8 of 8PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

If using micro-boost, it is critical to restrict dose to OARs \nto meet constraints that would normally have been achieved without such boost, sacrificing \ndose coverage of the boost as needed. Further, careful IGRT and delivery procedures \nshould be developed in line with the technical demands of this approach. Kerkmeijer LGW, \net al. J Clin Oncol 2021;39:787-796.b Prophylactic nodal radiotherapy (PNRT): The addition of PNRT in non-metastatic prostate \ncancer has not demonstrated consistent benefit in unselected populations. PNRT reduced \nrelapse and distant/regional progression in one randomized trial focusing on patients with \nhigh-risk features and negative metabolic (PET PSMA) staging imaging. While awaiting \npending trial data to mature in other cohorts, the Panel recommends PNRT in patients \nwith high-risk and regionally metastatic (cN+) prostate cancer, while deferring to physician \ndiscretion according to patient-specific factors in those with intermediate-risk disease. \nPNRT should not used in patients with lower risk disease. Murthy V, et al. J Clin Oncol \n2021;39:1234-1242.• Brachytherapy :\n\u0017Interstitial implantation of prostate +/- proximal seminal vesicles with temporary (high dose-rate, HDR) or permanent (low dose-rate, LDR) radioactive \nsources for monotherapy or as boost when added to EBRT should be performed in practices with adequate training, experience, and quality assurance \nmeasures. \n\u0017Patient selection should consider aspects of gland size, baseline urinary symptoms, and prior procedures (ie, transurethral resection of prostate) that may \nincrease risk of adverse effects. Neoadjuvant ADT to shrink a gland to allow treatment should balance its additional toxicity with this benefit. \n\u0017Post-implant dosimetry must be performed for LDR implants to verify dosimetry.\n\u0017Brachytherapy boost, when added to EBRT and ADT, improves biochemical control. To address historical trial data concerns for increased toxicity \nincidence, careful patient selection and contemporary planning associated with lesser toxicity, such as use of recognized organ at risk (OAR) dose \nconstraints, use of high-quality ultrasound and other imaging, and prescription of dose as close as possible to the target without excessive margins \nshould be implemented. Moreover, given trial data showing similar cancer control with lower toxicity with brachytherapy alone in unselected cohorts \nwith intermediate-risk prostate cancer, the use of combination EBRT with brachytherapy boost is best reserved for higher risk disease and unfavorable \nintermediate-risk disease with several risk factors.4\nDefinitive Radiation Therapy by Risk Group  (also see Table 1 on PROS-I [4 of 8]  and PROS-I [5 of 8] ) \n• Low riska,b  \n\u0017Patients with NCCN low-risk prostate cancer are encouraged to pursue active surveillance.\n\u0017Those electing treatment with RT may receive prostate-only EBRT or brachytherapy but should not be treated with combination brachytherapy boost with \nEBRT. ADT or antiandrogen therapy should NOT be used. \n• Favorable intermediate riska,b\n\u0017RT options include either EBRT or brachytherapy. Combination brachytherapy boost with EBRT should not be routinely used. ADT or antiandrogen therapy \nis not used routinely but can be considered if additional risk assessments suggest aggressive tumor behavior. \n• Unfavorable intermediate riska,b\n\u0017RT options include EBRT, brachytherapy boost combined with EBRT, or brachytherapy alone. ADT should be used unless additional risk assessments \nsuggest less aggressive tumor behavior or if medically contraindicated. Whether the duration of ADT can be reduced when combined with EBRT and \nbrachytherapy remains unclear . \n• High and very high riska,b\n\u0017RT options include EBRT or brachytherapy boost combined with EBRT. Brachytherapy alone should not be routinely used. ADT (level 1 data for long-\nterm ADT; see PROS-7) is required for patients with life expectancy >5 years or who are symptomatic unless medically contraindicated. Use of intensified \nandrogen receptor pathway inhibition strategies should be considered in select patients (see PROS-7 and PROS-G 1 of 6 ). Addition of abiraterone should \nbe used very selectively as the benefit in contemporary practice with modern staging is uncertain. \nPROS-I\n2 OF 8PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY \nContinuedReferences (PROS-I 8 of 8)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Clinically positive nodes should be dose-escalated as dose-volume histogram \nparameters allow. ADT is required unless medically contraindicated. The addition of abiraterone is preferred (see PROS-8 and  PROS-G 1 of 6 ). \n• Low metastatic burden, castration-sensitive disease\n\u0017RT to the prostate should be considered in patients with lower metastatic burden castration-sensitive metastatic disease according to CT, MRI, and \nbone scans when added to ADT. The definition of this cohort is evolving with study updates, concurrent use of intensified systemic therapies, and the \nintroduction of advanced PET imaging. The strongest data are for a benefit of adding RT in patients receiving either ADT alone, ADT+ docetaxel, or ADT + \nabiraterone for those with <4 bony metastases but should be noted to favor a benefit for up to 7 bony metastases, as reviewed:\n ◊High metastatic burden originally was defined according to the CHAARTED trial using CT, MRI, and bone scans by presence of visceral metastasis OR \n≥4 bone metastasis with at least one outside the vertebral bodies or pelvis. Low metastatic burden disease is defined by lesser volume or extent of \ndisease than high burden. Metastatic burden thus is defined by CT, MRI, and bone scans, whereas PET imaging should not be used to exclude a patient \nfrom treatment of the primary tumor.\n ◊This recommendation is based on the STAMPEDE phase 3 randomized trial's Arm H, which randomized 2061 patients to standard systemic therapy \nwith or without radiotherapy to the primary. The overall cohort had a significant improvement from the addition of radiotherapy to the primary in \nfailure-free survival (FFS), but not OS. The prespecified low-volume subset had a significant improvement in both FFS and OS.5 A meta-analysis with \ntwo other studies confirmed this benefit for primary RT to the primary tumor in lower volume disease.6\n ◊A subsequent update of the STAMPEDE study delineated with more granularity who benefits from treatment of the primary more simply based on \nnumber of bone metastases,7 given the practical challenges with using the CHAARTED definition. In this analysis, the survival benefit of primary RT \nadded to ADT continuously decreased with increasing bone lesion number for up to 7 metastases, with the strongest statistical association remaining \nfor those with <4 metastases. Thus, CT, MRI, and bone scans defined number of bony metastases without visceral involvement may be preferred to \ndefine candidacy for treatment of the primary tumor.\n\u0017Minimizing toxicity is paramount when delivering RT to the primary in patients with metastatic disease. As such, it is unclear if routine treatment of \nregional nodes in addition to the primary tumor or if substantial dose escalation beyond regimens used in prospective studies such as ST AMPEDE Arm H \nimproves outcomes; nodal treatment should be performed in the context of a clinical trial.\n\u0017Brachytherapy is not recommended outside of a clinical trial, as safety and efficacy have not been established in this patient population.\n\u0017At present, the use of primary RT cannot be used in itself to omit ADT intensification, and conversely, the use of ADT intensification does not clearly \nobviate the benefit of primary RT. \n• High-metastatic burden\n\u0017RT to the prostate should NOT be used in patients with high-volume metastatic disease outside the context of a clinical trial unless for palliative intent.\n\u0017This recommendation is based on two randomized trials, HORRAD and STAMPEDE, neither of which showed an improvement in OS from the addition of \nradiotherapy to the primary when combined with standard systemic therapy.\nReferences (PROS-I 8 of 8) PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Treatment is more effective when \npretreatment PSA is low and PSADT is long. This is based on trial data, as \nreviewed: \n\u0017Historically, indications for adjuvant RT based on randomized trial data \ninclude pT3a disease, positive margin(s), or seminal vesicle involvement, \nregardless of PSA status. Adjuvant RT is usually given within 1 year after \nRP and after operative side effects have improved/stabilized.  \n\u0017Currently, for most patients, institution of early postoperative \nradiotherapy for rising serum PSA levels at low levels is associated \nwith best cancer control outcomes and minimization of overtreatment.  \nThis is based upon a meta-analysis of three randomized studies in \nwhich adjuvant RT was not superior in event-free survival, compared \nto institution of early postoperative radiotherapy at low PSA (eg, after \nconfirmation of ≥0.1–0.2 ng/mL).8\n\u0017Notably, these studies did not well-represent patients with very-high-risk \nfeatures such as nodal involvement or particularly adverse features, \nwhere individualized risk-based decision-making should be favored.\nUse of ADT: Selection for ADT addition to postoperative RT continues \nto evolve based on clinicopathologic, patient-specific, and GC-based \nselection factors. Patients with high 22-gene GC scores (GC >0.6) should \nbe strongly considered for the addition of ADT to EBRT, particularly \nwhen the opportunity for early EBRT has been missed. Data for ADT use \nin patients with rising PSA after prostatectomy without metastases or \npathologic lymph node involvement is detailed:\n\u0017EBRT with 2 years of 150 mg/day of bicalutamide demonstrated improved \nOS and MFS on a prospective randomized trial (RTOG 9601) versus \nradiation alone in the secondary treatment setting. A secondary analysis \nof RTOG 9601 found that patients with PSA ≤0.6 ng/mL had no OS improvement with the addition of the antiandrogen to EBRT. In addition, \nresults of a retrospective analysis of RP specimens from patients in \nRTOG 9601 suggest that those with low PSA and a low GC score derived \nless benefit (development of distant metastases, OS) from bicalutamide \nthan those with a high GC score.9,10\n\u0017EBRT with 6 months of ADT (LHRH agonist) improved biochemical \nor clinical progression at 5 years on a prospective randomized trial \n(GETUG-16) versus radiation alone in patients with rising PSA levels \nbetween 0.2 and 2.0 ng/mL after RP.11\n\u0017The SPPORT (RTOG 0534) trial included patients with PSA levels between \n0.1 and 2.0 ng/mL after RP. The primary outcome measure of freedom \nfrom progression was 70.9% at 5 years (95% CI, 67.0–74.9) for those who \nreceived RT to the prostate bed and 81.3% (95% CI, 78.0–84.6) for those \nwho also received 4–6 months of ADT (LHRH agonist plus antiandrogen). \nIn a group that received RT to pelvic lymph nodes and the prostate bed \nand 4–6 months of ADT, freedom from progression at 5 years was 87.4% \n(95% CI, 84.7–90.2).12\n• Evidence supports offering adjuvant/secondary RT in most patients \nwith adverse pathologic features or detectable PSA and no evidence of \ndisseminated disease.\n• Typical prescribed doses for adjuvant RT or secondary post-prostatectomy \nRT for rising PSA are 64–72 Gy in standard fractionation. Biopsy-\nproven and/or imaging-defined gross recurrence may require higher \ndoses. Notably, randomized trial data for those without gross evident \ndisease demonstrated no benefit but higher physician-reported toxicity \nwith dose escalation for 70 Gy versus 64 Gy.13 Treatment volumes and \nOAR tolerances thus should be carefully considered and prioritized. \nHypofractionated post-prostatectomy RT to the prostate fossa alone is \nsupported by toxicity and outcome equipoise in post-hoc evaluation of the \nRADICALS-RT trial14 (52.5 Gy/20 fractions vs. 66 Gy/33 fractions) and in the \n2-year report of the NRG GU003 trial (62.5 Gy/25 fractions vs. 66.6 Gy/37 \nfractions).15 However, the Panel notes that these regimens have shorter \nfollow-up than historically studied conventionally fractionated regimens \nand a relative paucity of data for simultaneous integrated treatment of the \npelvic lymph nodes.\n• Nuclear medicine advanced imaging techniques with improved sensitivity \ncan be useful for localizing disease with PSA levels at low absolute levels, \nas low as 0.2 ng/mL (Discussion). \n• Target volumes include the prostate bed and may include the pelvic nodes \naccording to physician discretion.\nReferences PROS-I 8 of 8PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Due to prior therapy exposure, specific targets, and hematologic effects of these therapies, careful selection and sequencing strategy \nwith other therapies is important. This section discusses the two currently FDA-approved agents in use (Ra-223, Lu-177–PSMA-617).\n• Radium-223 is an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical that has been shown to extend survival in patients who have CRPC with symptomatic bone \nmetastases, but no visceral metastases. Radium-223 alone has not been shown to extend survival in patients with visceral metastases or bulky nodal \ndisease (>3–4 cm). Radium-223 causes double-strand DNA breaks and has a short radius of activity.\n\u0017Radium-223 is administered IV once a month for 6 months by an appropriately licensed facility. Concurrent use with systemic therapies other than ADT \nshould be pursued only on clinical trial due to potential for myelosuppression.\n\u0017Hematologic toxicities: Selection includes verification of baseline marrow reserve by CBC testing per label. Grade 3–4 hematologic toxicity (ie, 2% \nneutropenia, 3% thrombocytopenia, 6% anemia) occurs at low frequency . Verification of suitable counts per label prior to subsequent doses is important, \nand extended delays without sufficient recovery (eg, >6–8 weeks) should lead to discontinuation.\n\u0017Bone fracture risk: Radium-223 may increase fracture risk when given concomitantly with abiraterone acetate/prednisone. Concomitant use of \ndenosumab or zoledronic acid is recommended; it does not interfere with the beneficial effects of radium-223 on survival.\n• Lu-177–PSMA-61716\n\u0017Lu-177–PSMA-617 is a beta-emitting radiopharmaceutical that selectively binds to PSMA receptors on prostate cancer cells. In patients with PSMA-\npositive disease, Lu-177–PSMA-617 has been shown to improve OS in patients with progressive mCRPC previously treated with androgen receptor \ninhibitors and taxane chemotherapy.16 It has also been shown to improve rPFS in taxane-naive patients with PSMA-positive mCRPC who were previously \ntreated with an androgen receptor inhibitor compared with changing to a different androgen receptor inhibitor .17\n\u0017Lu-177–PSMA-617 is not recommended in patients with dominant PSMA-negative lesions. PSMA-negative lesions are defined as metastatic disease that \nlacks PSMA uptake including bone with soft tissue components ≥1.0 cm, lymph nodes ≥2.5 cm in short axis, and solid organ metastases ≥1.0 cm in size.\n\u0017Lu-177–PSMA-617 is typically administered IV 200 mCi (7.4 GBq) every 6 weeks for a total of 6 treatments by an appropriately licensed facility , usually \nin nuclear medicine or RT departments. Patients should be well-hydrated during treatment. Because Lu-177 also emits gamma radiation, appropriate \nprecautions should be taken to minimize exposure to personnel administering the radiopharmaceutical. Treatment rooms should be monitored for \npotential contamination following treatments, and patients should be provided written instructions regarding radiation safety precautions following \ntreatment.\n\u0017The most frequently reported side effects from Lu-177–PSMA-617 include fatigue (43%), dry mouth (39%), nausea (35%), and anemia (32%). \n\u0017Although the FDA has approved Ga-68 PSMA-11 for use with Lu-177–PSMA-617, the Panel believes that F-18 piflufolastat PSMA and F-18 flotufolastat \nPSMA can also be used in the same space due to multiple reports describing the equivalency of these imaging agents in:\n ◊PSMA molecular recognition motifs, \n ◊normal organ biodistribution, and \n ◊detection accuracy of prostate cancer lesions.\nPROS-I\n7 OF 8PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY \nContinuedReferences PROS-I 8 of 8PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

There is no single \nevidence-based threshold for performing PLND. Based on the \nrisk of complications with PLND and extra time to perform the \nprocedure, the published thresholds range from 2% to 7%.2-5  \n\u0017A patient who is above the threshold for performing a PLND, but \nhas a negative PSMA PET scan should still undergo PLND. In \ntwo studies, the sensitivity of PSMA PET for pelvic lymph node \ninvolvement among patients undergoing RP and PLND was low \n(about 40%), and the negative predictive value was about 81%.6,7 \nThus, basing the decision to perform PLND on a negative PSMA \nPET scan could result in missing 19% of patients with positive \nlymph nodes.\n\u0017PLND can be performed using an open, laparoscopic, or robotic \ntechnique.\n• Extended PLND provides more complete staging and may cure \nsome patients with microscopic metastases; therefore, an extended \nPLND is preferred when PLND is performed. \n• An extended PLND includes removal of all node-bearing tissue \nfrom an area bound by the external iliac vein anteriorly, the pelvic \nsidewall laterally, the bladder wall medially, the floor of the pelvis \nposteriorly, Cooper's ligament distally, and the internal iliac artery \nproximally.\n• While PLND at the time of RP has not been shown to improve \noncologic outcomes, it can provide staging and prognostic \ninformation.1Radical Prostatectomy\n• RP is an appropriate therapy for any patient not on an active \nsurveillance program with clinically localized prostate cancer that \ncan be completely excised surgically, who has a life expectancy of \n≥10 years, and who has no serious comorbid conditions that would \ncontraindicate an elective operation.\n• High-volume surgeons in high-volume centers generally provide \nbetter outcomes.\n• Blood loss can be substantial with RP, but can be reduced by using \nlaparoscopic or robotic assistance or by careful control of the \ndorsal vein complex and periprostatic vessels when performed as \nopen surgery.\n• Urinary incontinence can be reduced by preservation of urethral \nlength beyond the apex of the prostate and avoiding damage to \nthe distal sphincter mechanism. Bladder neck preservation may \ndecrease the risk of incontinence. Anastomotic strictures increase \nthe risk of long-term incontinence.\n• Recovery of erectile function is directly related to age at RP, \npreoperative erectile function, and the degree of preservation of the \ncavernous nerves. Replacement of resected nerves with nerve grafts \nhas not been shown to be beneficial. Early restoration of erections \nmay improve late recovery. \nSecondary Radical Prostatectomy\n• Secondary RP is an option for highly selected patients with local \nrecurrence after external beam RT (EBRT), brachytherapy, or \ncryotherapy in the absence of metastases, but the morbidity (ie, \nincontinence, loss of erection, anastomotic stricture) is high and the \noperation should be performed by surgeons who are experienced \nwith secondary RP.\nPROS-J\n1 OF 2References  (PROS-J 2 of 2)PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

The populations receiving the triplet and \ndoublet therapies experienced similar rates of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and neuropathy , although grade ≥3 adverse events \noccurred in 63% of patients who received the triplet combination compared with 52% of those receiving ADT and docetaxel.\n\u0017ADT with docetaxel and darolutamide was compared with ADT with docetaxel and placebo in a randomized phase 3 trial. OS, time to \nCRPC, skeletal event-free survival, and time to initiation of subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy were improved in the patients who \nreceived darolutamide. Adverse events of any grade, grade 3 to 5 adverse events, and serious adverse events occurred at similar incidence \nlevels between the two arms. Many of these were known effects of docetaxel. Exceptions were rash (16.6% vs. 13.5%) and hypertension \n(13.7% vs. 9.2%), which are known effects of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors and were more frequent in the darolutamide group.\n\u0017An open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial compared ADT with enzalutamide to ADT with a first-generation antiandrogen in this setting. \nConcurrent docetaxel was allowed and used for stratification. OS was improved with the use of enzalutamide over first-generation \nantiandrogen regardless of the addition of docetaxel. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia associated with \ndocetaxel use (6% in both groups), fatigue (1% in the control group vs. 6% in the enzalutamide group), and hypertension (6% vs. 10%). The \nincidence of grade 1–3 memory impairment was 4% versus 13%.\n• The use of myeloid growth factors should follow the NCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors , based on risk of neutropenic fever.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Adverse events associated \nwith docetaxel include neutropenia, leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, \nneutropenic infections, fluid retention, hypersensitivity reaction, \nhepatic function impairment, neuropathy, and other low-grade adverse \nevents (eg, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, alopecia, diarrhea).\n ◊Only regimens utilizing docetaxel on an every-3-week schedule \ndemonstrated beneficial impact on survival. The duration of therapy \nshould be based on the assessment of benefit and toxicities. In the \npivotal trials establishing survival advantage of docetaxel-based \nchemotherapy, patients received up to 10 cycles of treatment if no \nprogression and no prohibitive toxicities were noted.\n ◊Docetaxel retreatment can be attempted after progression on a novel \nhormone therapy in patients with mCRPC whose cancer has not \ndemonstrated definitive evidence of progression on prior docetaxel \ntherapy in the castration-sensitive setting.\n\u0017Cabazitaxel with concurrent steroid\n ◊Concurrent steroid includes daily prednisone, which may be omitted \non the day of chemotherapy administration when dexamethasone is \ngiven.\n ◊Patients who are not candidates for docetaxel or who are intolerant \nof docetaxel should be considered for cabazitaxel with concurrent \nsteroid, based on results that suggest clinical activity of cabazitaxel \nin mCRPC. Cabazitaxel was associated with lower rates of peripheral \nneuropathy than docetaxel, particularly at 20 mg/m2 (12% vs. 25%) \nand may be appropriate in patients with pre-existing mild peripheral \nneuropathy. Current data do not support greater efficacy of \ncabazitaxel over docetaxel. \n ◊Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m² with concurrent steroid has been shown \nin a randomized phase 3 study (TROPIC) to prolong OS, PFS, PSA response, and radiologic response when compared with mitoxantrone \nand prednisone and is FDA approved in the post-docetaxel second-\nline setting. Toxicity at this dose was significant and included \nfebrile neutropenia, severe diarrhea, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, \nanemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis, and renal failure. A recent trial, \nPROSELICA, compared cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² every 3 weeks to 20 \nmg/m² every 3 weeks. Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m² had less toxicity; febrile \nneutropenia, diarrhea, and fatigue were less frequent. Cabazitaxel \nat 20 mg/m² had a significantly lower PSA response rate but non-\nsignificantly lower radiographic response rate and non-significantly \nshorter PFS and OS (13.4 months vs. 14.5 months) compared to 25 \nmg/m². \n ◊Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 with concurrent steroid improved \nradiographic PFS and reduced the risk of death compared with \nabiraterone or enzalutamide in patients with prior docetaxel treatment \nfor mCRPC in the CARD study.\n ◊No chemotherapy regimen to date has demonstrated improved \nsurvival or quality of life after cabazitaxel, and trial participation \nshould be encouraged. \n\u0017Cabazitaxel/carboplatin with concurrent steroid \n ◊Concurrent steroid includes daily prednisone, which may be omitted \non the day of chemotherapy administration when dexamethasone is \ngiven.\n ◊Cabazitaxel 20 or 25 mg/m² plus carboplatin AUC 4 mg/mL per minute \nwith growth factor support can be considered for fit patients with \naggressive variant mCRPC  (ie, visceral metastases, low PSA and \nbulky disease, high LDH, high CEA, lytic bone metastases, NEPC \nhistology) or unfavorable genomics (defects in at least 2 of PTEN, \nTP53, and RB1).

Adverse events \nassociated with mitoxantrone are similar to docetaxel, but with lower \nrates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenic fevers, cardiovascular events, nausea \nand vomiting, metabolic disturbances, and neurologic events. \n\u0017Increasing PSA should not be used as the sole criteria for progression. \nAssessment of response should incorporate clinical and radiographic \ncriteria.  \n\u0017See NCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Growth Factors  for \nrecommendations on growth factor support.\n• PARP Inhibitors With or Without Novel Hormone Therapies\n\u0017Loss of BRCA1  and BRCA2  may be especially associated with response \nto PARP inhibitor therapy compared to other HRR gene alterations.\n\u0017Olaparib is an option for patients with mCRPC who have an HRR mutation \nand whose cancer has progressed on prior treatment with androgen \nreceptor-directed  therapy regardless of prior docetaxel therapy based on \nresults of a randomized phase 3 study in patients with HRR mutations. \nRadiographic PFS was improved over physician's choice of abiraterone \nor enzalutamide. Efficacy appears to be driven by the cohort of patients \nwith at least one alteration in BRCA2, BRCA1, or ATM, and in particular \nby patients with BRCA2  or BRCA1  mutations based on exploratory gene-\nby-gene analysis. There may be heterogeneity of response to olaparib for \nnon- BRCA  mutations based on the specific gene mutation (Discussion). \nIn the pre-docetaxel setting, olaparib is a preferred treatment option for \npatients with a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in BRCA1  \nor BRCA2 , and is also an option in this setting for patients with other \nHRR gene alterations (ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, \nFANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D,  or RAD54L ). Adverse events \nthat may occur with olaparib treatment include anemia (including that \nrequiring transfusion), fatigue, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, \ndiarrhea, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, creatinine elevation, cough, \nand dyspnea. Rare but serious side effects may include thromboembolic \nevents (including pulmonary emboli), drug-induced pneumonitis, and a \ntheoretical risk of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia. \u0017Rucaparib is an option for patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1 \nor BRCA2 mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been treated with \nandrogen receptor-directed therapy based on results from a randomized \nphase 3 trial that showed that the median duration of imaging-based \nPFS was significantly longer in the group that received rucaparib than in \nthose who received a control medication (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or \ndocetaxel). In the pre-docetaxel setting, rucaparib is a preferred option for \npatients with BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutations. Adverse events that may occur \nwith rucaparib include anemia (including that requiring transfusion), \nfatisgue, asthenia, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea \nor constipation, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, increased creatinine, \nincreased liver transaminases, and rash. Rare but serious side effects of \nrucaparib include a theoretical risk of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid \nleukemia, as well as fetal teratogenicity.\n\u0017Olaparib with abiraterone is an option for certain patients with mCRPC \n(PROS-16) and a pathogenic BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutation (germline and/\nor somatic) who have not yet received a novel hormone therapy based \non results of an international, double-blind, phase 3 trial. Imaging-based \nPFS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population was significantly longer in \nthe olaparib group than in the placebo group. The safety profile of the \nolaparib/abiraterone combination was as expected based on the known \nsafety profiles of the individual drugs, with the most common adverse \nevents being anemia, fatigue/asthenia, and nausea.\n• PARP Inhibitors With or Without Novel Hormone Therapies (continued)\n\u0017Talazoparib plus enzalutamide is a treatment option for patients with \nmCRPC and a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in an HRR \ngene (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, ATR, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA, MLH1, MRE11A, \nNBN, PALB2, or RAD51C ) who have not yet had treatment in the setting of \nCRPC, depending on prior treatment in other disease settings ( PROS-16) \nbased on results from a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial. Median \nradiographic PFS was improved in the talazoparib group compared with \nthe control group. The safety profile of enzalutamide plus talazoparib \nwas consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual drugs, \nwith the most common adverse events in those who received talazoparib \nbeing anemia, neutropenia, and fatigue.

There may be heterogeneity of response \nbased on the specific gene mutation ( Discussion). Use of talazoparib/\nenzalutamide for those who have received prior novel hormone therapy \nis controversial because a benefit of this combination over use of a P ARP \ninhibitor alone has not been shown in this setting, but responses are \nlikely.\n\u0017Niraparib plus abiraterone (combination tablet) is a treatment option \nfor patients with mCRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation \n(germline and/or somatic) who have not yet had treatment in the setting \nof mCRPC, depending on prior treatment in other disease settings \n(PROS-16) based on results of a randomized, double-blind  phase 3 trial. \nRadiographic PFS was improved for those receiving niraparib in the \nHRR mutation group overall and in the BRCA  mutation subgroup. The \nincidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was higher in the niraparib group \nthan in the placebo group, with anemia and hypertension as the most \nreported grade ≥3 adverse events.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-2 Overview \nAn estimated 288,300 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in \nthe United States in 2023, accounting for 29% of new cancer cases in \nmen.1 It is the most common cancer in men in the United States, who \ncurrently have a 1 in 8 lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer.1 The \nincidence of prostate cancer declined by approximately 40% from 2007 to \n2014, but since that time has increased at a rate of 3% annually. This \nincrease is driven by a rise in the diagnosis of regional and metastatic \ndisease, which may be a result of declining rates of prostate -specific \nantigen ( PSA)  testing that followed the 2012 USPSTF recommendations \nagainst  testing .2-10  \nResearchers further estimate that prostate cancer will account for 11% of \nmale cancer deaths in the United States in 2023, with an estimated 34,700 \ndeaths .1 The age -adjusted death rate from prostate cancer declined by \n52% from 1993 to 2017, but the death rate has become more stable in \nrecent years, with a 0.6% annual decrease from 2013 through 2020 .1 For \nall stages combined, the 5- year relative survival rate for prostate cancer is \n97%.1 The comparatively low death rate suggests that increased public \nawareness with earlier detection and treatment has affected mortality from \nthis prevalent cancer , but is also complicated by screening- related lead-\ntime bias and detection of indolent cancers. Maintenance of this low death \nrate is threatened by the rising prostate cancer incidence and diagnosis of \nadvanced disease.  \nUnfortunately, large inequities exist in incidence of and mortality from prostate cancer across racial and ethnic groups. The incidence rate in \nBlack individuals is 70% higher than in white individuals, and the mortality \nrate in this population is two to f our times higher than all other racial and \nethnic groups.\n1 In addition, the mortality rate for American Indian/Alaska \nNative populations is higher than for white individuals.  The USPSTF released updated recommendations in 2018 that include individualized, informed decision- making regarding prostate cancer \nscreening in males aged 55 to 69 years.\n11 These updated \nrecommendations may allow for a more balanced approach to prostate \ncancer early detection, and evidence suggests that PSA testing rates \nincreased after the USPSTF’s draft statement was released in 2017.12 \nBetter use of PSA for early detection of potentially fatal prostate cancer \ncoupled with the use of imaging and biomarkers to improve the specificity \nof screening should decrease the risk of overdetection (see the NCCN \nGuidelines for Prostate Cancer Early D etection, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). This reduced overdetection along with the use of active \nsurveillance in appropriate patients should reduce overtreatment AND \npreserve the relatively low rates of prostate cancer mortality . \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at www.NCCN.org . \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer, an \nelectronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key \nliterature in prostate cancer published since the previous Guidelines \nupdate, using the search term “prostate cancer.” The PubMed database \nwas chosen because it remains the most widely used resource for medical \nliterature and indexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.13 \nThe search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-3 guidelines as discussed by the panel during the Guidelines update have \nbeen included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations \nfor which high- level evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of \nlower -level evidence and expert opinion.   \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.14 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person- first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, anti -\nmisogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and inclusive \nof individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities.  NCCN \nGuidelines incorporate non- gendered language, instead focusing on \norgan- specific recommendations.  This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN Guidelines will \ncontinue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses . \nInitial Prostate Cancer Diagnosis \nInitial suspicion of prostate cancer is based on an abnormal digital rectal exam (DRE) or an elevated PSA level. A separate NCCN Guidelines \nPanel has written guidelines for prostate cancer early detection (see the \nNCCN Guidelines for Prostate Early Detecti on, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ). Definitive diagnosis requires biopsies of the prostate, \nusually performed by a urologist using a needle under transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance. A pathologist assigns a Gleason primary and secondary grade to the biopsy specimen. Clinical staging is based on \nthe TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification from the AJCC Staging \nManual, Eighth Edition.\n15 NCCN treatment recommendations are based on \nrisk stratification that includes TNM staging rather than on AJCC \nprognostic grouping.  \nPathology synoptic reports (protocols) are useful for reporting results from examinations of surgical specimens; these reports assist pathologists in \nproviding clinically useful and relevant information. The NCCN Guidelines \nPanel favors pathology synoptic reports from the College of American \nPathologists (CAP)  that comply with the Commission on Cancer (CoC) \nrequirements.\n16 \nEstimates of Life Expectancy \nEstimates of life expectancy have emerged as a key determinant of primary treatment, particularly when considering active surveillance or \nobservation. Life expectancy can be estimated for groups of individuals , \nbut it is difficult to extrapolate these estimates to an individual patient. Life expectancy can be estimated using the Minnesota Metropolitan Life \nInsurance Tables, the Social Security Administration Life Insurance \nTables,\n17 the WHO’s Life Tables by Country,18 or the Memorial Sloan \nKettering Male Life Expectancy tool19 and adjusted for individual patients \nby adding or subtracting 50% based on whether one believes the patient is \nin the healthiest quartile or the unhealthiest quartile, respectively.20 As an \nexample, the Social Security Administration Life Expectancy for a 65- year-\nold American male is 17.7 years. If judged to be in the upper quartile of \nhealth, a life expectancy of 26.5 years is assigned. If judged to be in the \nlower quartile of health, a life expectancy of 8.8 years is assigned. Thus, \ntreatment recommendations could change dramatically using the NCCN \nGuidelines if a 65- year-old patient  was judged to be in either poor or \nexcellent health.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-4 Prostate Cancer Genetics \nFamily history of prostate cancer raises the risk of prostate cancer.21-24 In \naddition, prostate cancer has been associated with hereditary breast and \novarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome ( due to germline mutations in \nhomologous DNA repair genes ) and Lynch syndrome (resulting from \ngermline mutations in DNA mismatch repair  [MMR]  genes).24-29 In fact, \napproximately 11% of patients with prostate cancer and at least 1 \nadditional primary cancer carry germline mutations associated with \nincreased cancer risk.30 Therefore, the panel recommends a thorough \nreview of personal and family history for all patients with prostate \ncancer.31,32 \nThe newfound appreciation of the frequency of germline mutations has implications for family genetic counseling, cancer risk syndromes, and \nassessment of personal risk for subsequent cancers. Some patients with \nprostate cancer and their families may be at increased risk for breast and \novarian cancer, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer ( HBOC ); colorectal \ncancers (Lynch syndrome); and other cancer types. Data also suggest that patients with prostate cancer who have BRCA1/2  germline mutations have \nincreased risk of progression on local therapy and decreased overall \nsurvival (OS).\n33-35 This information should be discussed with such patients  \nif they are considering active surveillance. Finally, there are possible \ntreatment implications for patients with DNA repair defects  (see Treatment \nOptions  for Patients with DNA Repair Gene Mutations , below).  \nProstate cancer is often associated with somatic mutations that occur in the tumor but not in the germline. An estimated 89% of metastatic \ncastration- resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tumors contain a potentially \nactionable mutation, with only about 9% of t hese occurring in the \ngermline.\n36 Both germline and tumor mutations are discussed herein.  Homologous DNA Repair Genes  \nSomatic mutations in DNA repair pathway genes occur in up to 19% of \nlocalized prostate tumors and 23% of metastatic CRPC tumors, with most \nmutations found in BRCA2  and ATM .36,37 These tumor mutations are often \nassociated with germline mutations. For example, 42% of patients with \nmetastatic CRPC and somatic mutations in BRCA2  were found to carry \nthe mutation in their germlines.36 In localized prostate cancer, that number \nwas 60%.37  \nOverall, g ermline DNA repair mutations have been reported with the \nlowest  frequencies seen in patients  with lower -risk localized prostate \ncancer  (1.6% –3.8%), higher frequencies in those with higher -risk localized \ndisease ( 6%–8.9%), and the highest frequencies in those with metastatic \ndisease (7.3% –16.2%).36,38- 44 One study found that 11.8% of patients  with \nmetastatic prostate cancer have germline mutations in 1 of 16 DNA repair genes: BRCA2  (5.3%), ATM  (1.6%), CHEK2  (1.9%), BRCA1  (0.9%), \nRAD51D (0.4%), PALB2  (0.4%), ATR (0.3%), and NBN, PMS2 , GEN1 , \nMSH2 , MSH6 , RAD51C, MRE11A , BRIP1 , or FAM175A .\n43  \nAn additional study showed that 9 of 125 patients  with high -risk, very- high-\nrisk, or metastatic prostate cancer (7.2%) had pathogenic germline \nmutations in MUTYH  (4), ATM  (2), BRCA1  (1), BRCA2  (1), and BRIP1  \n(1).40 In this study, the rate of metastatic disease among those with a \nmutation identified was high (28.6%, 2 of 7 patients ). Although having a \nrelative with breast cancer was associated with germline mutation \nidentification (P = .035) , only 45.5% of the mutation carriers in the study \nhad mutations that were concordant with their personal  and family history . \nAnother study also found that a family history of breast cancer increased \nthe chances of identifying a germline DNA repair gene mutation in patients  \nwith pr ostate cancer ( OR, 1.89;  95% CI, 1.33–2.68; P = .003 ).45 In a study \nof an unselected cohort of 3607 patients  with a personal history of prostate PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Patients with Lynch syndrome may have \nan increased risk for prostate cancer. In particular, studies show an \nincreased risk for prostate cancer in patients who are older  and have  \ngermline MSH2  mutations.70,71 \nIn a study of more than 15,000 patients with cancer treated at Memorial \nSloan Kettering Cancer Center  who had their tumor and matched normal DNA sequenced and tumor MSI status assessed, approximately 5% of \n1048 patients with prostate cancer had MSI -high (MSI -H) or MSI -\nindeterminate tumors, 5.6% of whom were found to have Lynch syndrome (0.29% of patients with prostate cancer).\n25 In another prospective case \nseries, the tumors of 3.1% of 1033 patients with prostate cancer \ndemonstrated MSI-H/dMMR  status, and 21.9% of these patients had \nLynch syndrome (0.68% of the total population).72 In a study of an \nunselected cohort of 3607 patients  with a personal history of prostate \ncancer who had germline genetic testing based on clinician referral, 1.7% \nhad germline mutations in PMS2 , MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 .46 \nEffect of Intraductal/Cribriform or Ductal Histology  \nDuctal prostate carcinomas are rare, accounting for approximately 1.3% of \nprostate carcinomas.73 Intraductal prostate cancer may be more common, \nespecially in higher risk groups, and may be associated with a poor \nprognosis.74 It is important to note that there is significant overlap in \ndiagnostic criteria and that intraductal, ductal, and invasive cribriform \nfeatures may coexist in the same biopsy. By definition, intraductal \ncarcinoma includes cribriform proliferation of malignant cells as long as \nthey rem ain confined to a preexisting gland that is surrounded by basal \ncells. These features are seen frequently with an adjacent invasive cribriform component and would be missed without the use of basal cell \nmarkers.  \nLimited data suggest that acinar prostate adenocarcinoma with invasive \ncribriform pattern, intraductal carcinoma of prostate (IDC -P), or ductal \nadenocarcinoma component y have increased genomic instability.\n75-78 In \nparticular, tumors with these histologies may be more likely to harbor \nsomatic MMR gene alterations than those with adenocarcinoma \nhistology.78-80 In addition, limited data suggest that germline homologous \nDNA repair gene mutations may be more common in prostate tumors of \nductal or intraductal origin81,82 and that intraductal histology is common in PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-6 germline BRCA2  mutation carriers  with prostate cancer.83 Overall, the \npanel believes that the data connecting histology and the presence of \ngenomic alterations are stronger for intraductal than ductal histology at this \ntime. Therefore, patients with presence of intraductal carcinoma on biopsy \nshould have germline testing as described below.  \nGenetic Testing Recommendations  \nGermline Testing Based on Family History, Histology, and Risk Groups  \nThe panel recommends inquiring about family and personal history of \ncancer and known germline variants at time of initial diagnosis. Germline \ntesting should be considered in appropriate individuals where it is likely to impact the prostate cancer treatment and clinical trial options, \nmanagement of risk of other cancers, and/or potential risk of cancer in \nfamily members. Based on the data discussed above, the panel \nrecommends germline genetic testing for patients with prostate cancer and \nany of the following\n31,32: \n• A positive family history (see definition in the guidelines above)  \n• High-risk, very -high- risk, regional, or metastatic prostate cancer, \nregardless of family history  \n• Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry  \n• A personal history of breast cancer  \nIn addition, germline genetic testing should be considered in patients with \na personal history of prostate cancer  and 1) intermediate- risk prostate \ncancer and intraductal/cribriform histology  or 2) a personal history of \nexocrine pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colorectal, gastric, melanoma, \npancreatic cancer , upper tract urothelial  cancer , glioblastoma, biliary tract  \ncancer , and small intestinal cancer.  \nGermline testing, when performed, should include MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 , \nand PMS2  (for Lynch syndrome) and the homologous recombination \ngenes  BRCA 1, BRCA 2, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2 . Additional genes may \nbe appropriate depending on clinical context. For example, HOXB13  is a prostate cancer risk gene and, whereas there are not currently clear therapeutic implications in the advanced disease setting, testing may have \nutility  for family counseling.\n84,85 \nGenetic counseling resources and support are critical, and p ost-test \ngenetic counseling is recommended if a germline mutation (pathogenic \nvariant) is identified. Cascade testing for relatives is critical to inform the \nrisk for familial cancers in all relatives. Post-test genetic counseling is \nrecommended if positive family history but no pathogenic variant OR if \nonly germline variants of unknown significance (VUS) are identified. This \nis to ensure accurate understanding of family implications and review \nindications for additional testing and/or follow up (including clinical trials of \nreclassification). Resources are available to check the known pathologic \neffects of genomic variants (eg, https://brcaexchange.org/about/app; \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ). Information regarding germline \nmutations in patients with metastatic disease can be used to inform future \ntreatments or to determine eligibility for clinical trials.  \nSomatic Tumor Testing Based on Risk Groups  \nTumor  testing recommendations are as follows:  \n1. Tumor testing for somatic homologous recombination gene \nmutations (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D , \nCHEK2 , CDK12 ) can be considered in patients with regional (N1) \nprostate cancer and is recommended for those with metastatic \ndisease.  \n2. Tumor testing for MSI or dMMR  can be considered in patients with \nregional or metastatic castration- naïve prostate cancer and is \nrecommended in the metastatic CRPC setting.  \n3. Tumor mutational burden ( TMB ) testing may be considered in \npatients with metastatic CRPC.  \n4.

The Decipher molecular assay is recommended to inform adjuvant \ntreatment if adverse features are found post -radical prostatectomy, \nand can be considered as part of counseling for risk stratification in patients with PSA resistance/recurrence after radical \nprostatectomy (category 2B). See Tumor Multigene Molecular \nTesting, below).  \n The panel strongly recommends a metastatic biopsy for histologic and \nmolecular evaluation. When unsafe or unfeasible, plasma ctDNA assay is \nan option, preferably collected during biochemical (PSA) and/or \nradiographic progression in order to maximize diagnostic yield. Caution is \nneeded when interpreting ctDNA -only evaluation due to potential \ninterference from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which can result in a false- positive biomarker signal.\n86 \nIf MSI testing is performed, testing using an NGS assay validated for \nprostate cancer is preferred.87-89 If MSI -H or dMMR is found, the patient \nshould be referred for genetic counseling to assess for the possibility of \nLynch syndrome. MSI -H or dMMR indicate eligibility for pembrolizumab for \ncertain patients with metastatic CRPC (see Pembrolizumab, below).  \nPost-test genetic counseling is recommended  if pathogenic/likely \npathogenic  somatic mutations in any gene that has clinical implications if \nalso identified in germline (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, \nMLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2).  Post-test genetic counseling to assess for \nthe possibility of Lynch syndrome is recommended if MSI -H or dMMR is \nfound.  Virtually none of the NGS tests is designed or validated for \ngermline assessment. Therefore, over -interpretation of germline findings \nshould be avoided. If a germ line mutation is suspected, the patient should be recommended for genetic counseling and follow -up dedicated germline \ntesting.  \nAdditional Testing  \nTumors from a majority of patients with metastatic CRPC harbor mutations \nin genes involved in the androgen receptor signaling pathway.36 Androgen \nreceptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) testing in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) \ncan be considered to help guide selection of therapy in the post -\nabiraterone/enzalutamide metastatic CRPC setting (discussed in more \ndetail below, under AR -V7 Testing) .  \nRisk Stratification for Clinically Localized Disease \nOptimal treatment of prostate cancer requires estimation of risk: How likely \nis a given cancer to be confined to the prostate or spread to the regional \nlymph nodes? How likely is the cancer to progress or metastasize after \ntreatment? How likely is adjuvant or post -recurrence radiation to control \ncancer after an unsuccessful radical prostatectomy ? \nNCCN and other risk classification schemas are prognostic and have not \nbeen shown to be predictive of benefit to a specific treatment.  Thus, \nrecommendations of when to offer conservative management  versus  \nradical therapy  and the use of short -term v ersus long- term ADT are based \non expert opinion and estimates of absolute benefit and harm from a given \ntherapy in the context of NCCN risk groups.   \nThere are newer risk classification schemas that have been shown to \noutperform NCCN risk groups,90,91 as well as tools ( ie, imaging, gene \nexpression biomarkers, germline testing) that together improve risk \nstratification.  These tools should not be ordered reflexively.  They are  \nrecommended only when they will have the ability to change management \n(eg, active surveillance vs . radical treatment) . Improved risk stratification \ncan better identify patients who may derive greater or lesser absolute benefit from a given treatment.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-8 NCCN Risk Groups  \nThe NCCN Guidelines have, for many years, incorporated a risk \nstratification scheme that uses a minimum of stage, Gleason grade, and \nPSA to assign patients to risk groups. These risk groups are used to select \nthe appropriate options that should be considered and to predict the \nprobability of biochemical recurrence after definitive local therapy.92 Risk \ngroup stratification has been published widely and validated, and provides \na better basis for treatment recommendations than clinical stage alone.93,94 \nA new prostate cancer grading system was developed during the 2014 \nInternational Society of Urological Pathology  (ISUP) Consensus \nConference .95 Several changes were made to the assignment of Gleason \npattern based on pathology. The new system assigns Grade Groups from 1 to 5, derived from the Gleason score.  \n• Grade Group 1: Gleason score ≤6; o nly individual discrete well -\nformed glands  \n• Grade Group 2: Gleason score 3+4=7; p redominantly well -formed \nglands with lesser component of poorly  formed/fused/cribriform \nglands  \n• Grade Group 3: Gleason score 4+3=7; p redominantly poorly  \nformed/fused/cribriform glands with lesser component of well -\nformed glands  \no For cases with  >95% poorly  formed/fused/cribriform glands \nor lack of glands on a core or at radical prostatectomy , the \ncomponent of <5% well -formed glands is not  factored into \nthe grade.  \n• Grade Group 4: Gleason score 4+4=8; 3+5=8; 5+3=8 \no Only poorly  formed/fused/cribriform glands ; or \no Predominantly well -formed glands and lesser component \nlacking glands  (poorly  formed/fused/cribriform glands can \nbe a more minor component ); or o Predominantly lacking glands and lesser component of \nwell-formed glands ( poorly  formed/fused/cribriform glands \ncan be a more minor component)  \n• Grade Group 5: Gleason score 9– 10; lack gland formation (or with \nnecrosis) with or without poorly  formed/fused/cribriform glands  \no For case s with >95% poorly  formed/fused/cribriform glands \nor lack of glands on a core or at radical prostatectomy, the \ncomponent of <5% well -formed glands is not factored into \nthe grade.  \nMany experts believe that ISUP  Grade Groups will enable patients to \nbetter understand their true risk level and thereby limit overtreatment. The \nnew Grade Group system was validated in two separate cohorts, one of \n>26,000 patients  and one of 5880 patients , treated for prostate cancer \nwith either radical prostatectomy or radiation.\n96,97 Both studies found that \nGrade Groups predicted the risk of recurrence after primary treatment. For \ninstance, in the larger study, the 5 -year biochemical recurrence -free \nprogression probabilities after radical prostatectomy for G rade Groups 1 \nthrough 5 were 96% (95% CI, 95– 96), 88% (95% CI, 85– 89), 63% (95% \nCI, 61 –65), 48% (95%  CI, 44 –52), and 26% (95% CI, 23– 30), respectively. \nThe separation between Grade Groups was less pronounced in the \nradiation therapy (RT) cohort, likely because of increased use of \nneoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in \nthe higher risk groups. In another study of the new ISUP Grade Group \nsystem, all -cause mortality and prostate cancer -specific mortality were \nhigher in patients  in Grade Group 5 than in those in G rade Group 4.98 \nAdditional studies have supported the validity of this new system.99-104 The \nNCCN Panel has accepted the new  Grade Group system to inform better \ntreatment discussions compared to those using Gleason score. Patients \nremain divided into very -low-, low- , intermediate- , high- , and very -high- risk \ngroups.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-9 The NCCN Guidelines Panel recognized that heterogeneity exists within \neach risk group. For example, an analysis of 12,821 patients showed that \nthose assigned to the intermediate -risk group by clinical stage (T2b– T2c) \nhad a lower risk of recurrence than those  categorized according to \nGleason score (7) or PSA level (10– 20 ng/mL).105 A similar trend of \nsuperior recurrence -free survival was observed in patients  placed in the \nhigh- risk group by clinical stage (T3a) compared to those assigned by \nGleason score (8– 10) or PSA level (>20 ng/mL), although it did not reach \nstatistical significance. Other studies have reported differences in outcomes in the high -risk gro up depending on risk factors or primary \nGleason pattern.\n106,107 Evidence also shows heterogeneity in the low -risk \ngroup, with PSA levels and percent positive cores affecting pathologic \nfindings after radical prostatectomy.108,109 \nIn a retrospective study, 1024 patients  with intermediate- risk prostate \ncancer were treated with radiation with or without neoadjuvant and concurrent ADT.\n110 Multivariate analysis revealed that p rimary Gleason \npattern 4, number  of positive biopsy cores  ≥50%, and presence of >1 \nintermediate- risk factors (IRFs; ie, T2b- c, PSA 10–20 ng/mL, Gleason \nscore 7 ) were significant predictors of increased incidence of  distant \nmetastasis . The authors used these factors to separate the patients into \nunfavorable and favorable intermediate -risk groups and determined that \nthe unfavorable intermediate- risk group had worse  PSA recurrence -free \nsurvival and higher rates of  distant metastasis  and prostate cancer -\nspecific mortality than the favorable intermediate -risk group. The use of \nactive surveillance in patients  with favorable intermediate- risk prostate \ncancer is discussed below (see Active Surveillance in  Favorable \nIntermediate Risk ). The NCCN Panel has included the separation of \nintermediate risk group into favorable and unfavorable subsets in their risk \nstratification scheme.  Nomograms  \nThe more clinically relevant information that is used in the calculation of \ntime to PSA recurrence, the more accurate the result. A nomogram is a \npredictive instrument that takes a set of input data (variables) and makes \npredictions about an outcome. Nomog rams predict more accurately for the \nindividual patient than risk groups, because they combine the relevant \nprognostic variables. The Partin tables  were the first to achieve \nwidespread use for counseling patients  with clinically localized prostate \ncancer.111- 114 The tables give the probability (95% CI) that a patient with a \ncertain clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA will have a cancer of each \npathologic stage.

Molecular testing of a tumor offers the potential of \nadded insight into the “biologic behavior” of a cancer that could thereby aid \nin the clinical decision- making. The NCCN Prostate Cancer Guidelines \nPanel strongly advocates for use of life expectancy estimation, \nnomograms , and other clinical parameters such as PSA density as the \nfoundations for augmented clinical decision- making. Whereas  risk groups, \nlife expect ancy estimates, and nomograms help inform decisions, \nuncertainty about disease progression persists , and this is where the \nprognostic multigene molecular testing can have a role.  \nSeveral tissue-based molecular assays have been developed in an effort \nto improve decision- making in newly diagnosed patients  considering active \nsurveillance and in treated patients  considering adjuvant therapy  or \ntreatment for recurrence. U ncertainty about the risk of disease progression \ncan be reduced if such molecular assays can provide accurate and \nreproducible prognostic or predictive information beyond NCCN risk group \nassignment and currently available life expectancy tables and nomograms. \nRetrospective case cohort studies have shown that these assays provide \nprognostic information independent of NCCN or CAPRA risk groups , \nwhich include likelihood of death with conservative management, \nlikelihood of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy or EBRT, \nlikelihood of adverse pathologic features after radical prostatectomy, and \nlikelihood of developing metastasis after  operation, definitive EBRT, or \npost-recurrence EBRT .\n143- 155 Evaluation of diagnostic biopsy tissue from \npatients enrolled in the Canary PASS multicenter active surveillance \ncohort  suggested that results of a molecular assay were not associated with adverse pathology either alone or in combination with clinical variables.\n156 \nClinical utility studies on the tissue -based molecular assays have also \nbeen performed.157- 159 One prospective, clinical utility study of 3966 \npatients  newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer found that the \nrates of active surveillance increased with use of a t issue -based gene \nexpression classifier .157 Active surveillance rates were 46.2%, 75.9%, and \n57.9% for those whose classifier results were above the specified \nthreshold, those whose classifier results were below the threshold, and \nthose who did not undergo genomic testing, respectively  (P < .001). The \nauthors estimate that one additional patient may choose active \nsurveillance for every nine patients  with favorable- risk prostate cancer who \nundergo genomic  testing .  \nAnother clinical utility study used two prospective registries of patients  with \nprostate cancer post -radical prostatectomy (n = 3455).158 Results of \nmolecular testing with Decipher changed management recommendations \nfor 39% of patients . This study also evaluated clinical benefit in 102 \npatients. Those who were classified as high risk by the assay had \nsignificantly different 2 -year PSA recurrence rates if they received \nadjuvant EBRT versus if they did not (3% vs. 25%; hazard ratio [ HR], 0.1; \n95% CI , 0.0–0.6; P = .013) . No differences in 2 -year PSA recurrence were \nobserved between those who did and did not receive adjuvant therapy in \nthose classified as low or intermediate risk by the assay. Based on these \nresults, the panel recommends that the Decipher molecular assay should \nbe used to inform adjuvant treatment if adverse features are found post -\nradical prostatectomy.  \nSeveral of these assays are available, and four have received positive \nreviews by t he Molecular Diagnostic Services Program (MolDX)  and are \nlikely to be covered by CMS (Cen ters for Medicare & Medicaid S ervices) .

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-11 Several other tests are under development, and the use of these assays is \nlikely to increase in the coming years.  \nTable 1 lists these tests in alphabetical order and provides an overview of \neach test, populations where each test independently predicts outcome,  \nand supporting references. These molecular biomarker tests  have been \ndeveloped with extensive industry support, guidance, and involvement, \nand have been marketed under the less rigorous U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration ( FDA) regulatory pathway for biomarkers. Although full \nassessment of t heir clinical utility requires  prospectiv e randomized clinical \ntrials, which are unlikely to be done , the panel believes that patients  with \nlow or favorable intermediate disease and life expectancy greater than or \nequal to 10 years may consider the use of Decipher, Oncotype DX \nProstate,  or Prolaris during initial risk stratification . Patients with \nunfavorable intermediate - and high- risk disease and life expectancy \ngreater than or equal to 10 years may consider the use of Decipher or \nProlaris. In addition, Decipher may be considered to inform adjuvant \ntreatment if adverse features are found after radical prostatectomy and \nduring workup for radical prostatectomy PSA persistence or recurrence \n(category 2B for the latter setting).  Future c omparative effectiveness \nresearch may allow these tests and others like them to gain additional \nevidence regarding their utility  for better risk stratification of  patients  with \nprostate cancer .  \nInitial Clinical Assessment and Staging Evaluation \nFor patients with very -low-, low- , and intermediate- risk prostate cancer \nand a life expectancy of 5 years or less and without clinical symptoms, \nfurther imaging and treatment should be delayed until symptoms develop, \nat which time imaging can be performed and ADT should be given. Those \nwith a life expectancy less than or equal to 5 years who fall into the high-  \nor very -high- risk categories should undergo bone imaging and, if indicated by nomogram prediction of lymph node involvement, pelvic +/ - abdominal \nimaging.  \nFor symptomatic patients and/or those with a life expectancy of greater \nthan 5 years, bone and soft tissue  imaging is appropriate for patients with  \nunfavorable intermediate -risk, high- risk, and very -high- risk prostate \ncancer :  \n• Bone imaging can be achieved by conventional technetium -99m-\nMDP bone scan.  \no Plain films, CT, MRI, or PET/CT or PET/MRI with F -18 \nsodium fluoride, C -11 choline, F- 18 fluciclovine, Ga- 68 \nprostate- specific membrane antigen (PSMA) -11, or F- 18 \npiflufolastat PSMA can be considered for equivocal results \non initial bone imaging.  \n• Soft tissue imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest can include \nchest CT and abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI. \nmpMRI is preferred over CT for pelvic staging.  \n• Alternatively, Ga -68 PSMA -11 or F- 18 piflufolastat PSMA PET/CT \nor PET/MRI can be considered for bone and soft tissue (full body) imaging.  \no Because of the increased sensitivity and specificity of \nPSMA- PET tracers for detecting micrometastatic disease \ncompared to conventional imaging (CT, MRI) at both initial \nstaging and biochemical recurrence, the Panel does not \nfeel that conventional imaging is a necessary prerequisite \nto PSMA -PET and that PSMA -PET/CT or PSMA- PET/MRI \ncan serve as an equally effective, if not more effective front -\nline imaging tool for these patients.  \nRetrospective evidence suggests that Gleason score and PSA levels are associated with positive bone scan findings.\n160 Multivariate analysis of \nretrospective data on 643 patients  with newly diagnosed prostate cancer PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Current clinical imaging techniques for prostate \ncancer include conventional radiography (ie, x -rays), ultrasound, CT, MRI , \nsingle photon emission computed tomography (SPECT, scintigraphy), and PET. Some of these modalities have the ability to assess both anatomy \nand tumor function/biology. For example, functional MR sequences can be \nadded to conventional anatomic MR sequences in a clinical examination \nsuch as diffusion -weighted imaging (DWI) to assess tumor cellularity or \nMR spectroscopy (MRS) to assess tumor metabolism.  \nDifferent modalities can also be merged to maximize prostate cancer \nassessment. For example, the functional information obtained with PET \ncan be combined with the spatial and anatomic information with either CT \n(ie, PET/CT) or MRI (ie, PET/MRI) to inform a bout the locations of tumor \nfoci for diagnosis or therapy response. Another example of the advantage of combining modalities is MR -ultrasound fusion guided biopsy (eg, MR -\nTRUS) where MRI datasets containing information on suspicious lesions identified by t he radiologist are used by the urologist to navigate \nultrasound- guided biopsies of the prostate for more accurate diagnosis.\n162 \nMore details on each technique are outlined in the algorithm under Principles of Imaging . Multiparametric MRI  (mpMRI)  \nThe use of mpMRI  in the staging and characterization of prostate cancer \nhas increased  in the last few years. mpMRI examinations typically include \nthree sequences: T2 -weighted imaging, DWI, and dynamic contrast \nenhancement (DCE) imaging. There has been increased interest in biparametric imaging that excludes the use of gadolinium contrast in \nprostate MRI examinati ons; however, more data are needed to identify the \nrisk groups who would benefit most from this approach.\n163 In general, it is \nrecommended that mpMRI be performed on a 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic \nstrength MRI scanner. This is the highest strength scanner in routine \nclinical use and provides the best possible evaluation of prostate cancer.  \nAdditional instrumentation can be used, such as an endorectal coil (ERC) \nto improve image quality. If a lower strength 1.5T MRI cancer is required \nfor a patient because of indwelling medical device incompatibility with 3T \nMRI, an ERC is recommended. Use of  ERC in routine prostate imaging is \ncontroversial. Current data suggest that a 3T exam with ERC may not be significantly better than a 3T exam without ERC. Moreover, there may not \nbe a significant difference in image interpretation between a 1.5T with \nERC and 3T without ERC.\n164 The use of ERC in prostate MRI also \nintroduces new problems into the clinical workflow including patient \ndiscomfort, prostate distortion, increased scanner time and expense, and \nrequirement of someone experienced to place the ERC.  \nEvidence support s the implementation of mpMRI in several aspects of \nprostate cancer management.162 First,  mpMRI helps detect large r and/or \nmore poorly differentiated cancers  (ie, Grade Group ≥2).165 mpMRI  has \nbeen incorporated into MRI -TRUS fusion -targeted biopsy protocols, which \nhas led to an increase in the diagnosis of high -grade cancers  with fewer \nbiopsy cores, while reducing detection of low -grade and insignificant \ncancers .166- 168 In fact, a recently published clinical study identified that MRI -\ntargeted biopsy synergized with conventional systematic biopsy to identify PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Although these tracers are approved for the evaluation of patients \nwith biochemical recurrence, the PSMA tracers Ga- 68 PSMA -11 and F- 18 \npiflufolastat are also approved for patients at initial staging with suspected \nmetastatic disease. Tracer distribution in patients with prostate cancer can  \nbe imaged with either PET/CT or PET/MRI modalities. Although CT and \nMRI are equivalent in the assessment of lymphadenopathy, PET/MRI has \nthe added advantage over PET/CT with enhanced tissue contrast that is \nespecially important in evaluation of pelvic anatomy and prostate cancer \nassessment. Table 2 summarizes  the FDA-cleared PET imaging tracers \nstudied in prostate cancer.  F-18 FDG  PET should not be used routinely,  \nbecause data are limited in patients with prostate cancer  and suggest that \nits sensitivity is significantly lower than that seen with the above described \ntracers .175- 177 PSMA- PET refers to a growing body of radiopharmaceuticals that target \nprostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA)  on the surface of prostate \ncells. Because of the high density of PSMA receptors on the surface of \ncancer cells relative to adjacent prostate, PSMA -PET has the advantage \nof high signal -to-noise relative to adjacent tissues. The mechanistic role of \nandrogen receptor signaling in PSMA regulat ion is still being investigated, \nas multiple reports in animals and humans suggest that androgen \nmodulation can affect PSMA expression and may even be dichotomous in \npatients with castration- naïve versus castrate- resistant disease.178- 180 \nThere are multiple PSMA radiopharmaceuticals at various stages of \ninvestigation. At this time, the NCCN Guidelines only recommend two \nPSMA tracers : the currently FDA -approved PSMA agents, F -18 \npiflufolastat  and Ga -68 PSMA -11. F-18 piflufolastat  PSMA or Ga -68 \nPSMA- 11 PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered as an alternative to \nstandard imaging of bone and soft tissue for initial staging, the detection of \nbiochemically recurrent disease, and as workup for progression with bone \nscan plus CT or MRI for the evaluat ion of bone, pelvis, and abdomen.  \nStudies suggest that PSMA  PET imaging has  a higher sensitivity than C -\n11 choline or F- 18 fluciclovine  PET imaging, especially at very low PSA \nlevels.181- 186 The reported sensitivity and specificity for PSMA -11 PET/CT in \nthe detection of  nodal involvement in primary staging of  patients with  \nintermediate- , high- , and very -high- risk disease is 40% and 95%, \nrespectively.187 The patient -level positive predictive value ( PPV)  in \ndetection of lesions in patients with biochemical recurrence ( BCR)  is \n92%.188 Similarly, the reported sensitivity and specificity for piflufolastat \nPET/CT in the detection of nodal involvement in primary staging of \npatients  with unfavorable intermediate -, high- , and very -high- risk disease \nis 31%  to 42% and 96%  to 99%, respectively.189,190 The patient -level \ncorrect localization rate (CLR; patient -level PPV validated by anatomic \nlesion co- localization ) for piflufolastat PET/CT is 85%  to 87%.191 Thus, \nPSMA- 11 and piflufolastat are considered equivalent.

The \npanel believes that  F-18 fluciclovine  PET/CT or PET/MRI or C -11 choline \nPET/CT or PET/MRI may be used in patients  with biochemical recurrence \nafter primary treatment for further soft tissue and/or bone evaluation after \nbone scan, chest CT, and abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI.  \nThe use of these PET tracers can lead to changes in clinical management. \nThe FALCON trial showed that results of F- 18 fluciclovine PET/CT in 104 \npatients with biochemical recurrence after definitive therapy resulted in a change in disease management for 64%  of patients .\n206 In addition, the \nLOCATE trial demonstrated that fluciclovine  frequently changed disease \nmanagement plans in patients with biochemical recurrence .207 In a similar \nfashion, data also show that PSMA PET has the ability to change radiation \ntreatment planning in 53% (N  = 45) of patients with high-  and very -high-\nrisk prostate cancer using PSMA -11 as well as change disease \nmanagement in over half of a prospective cohort of 635 patients with BCR.208,209 However, whether changes to treatment planning because of \nPET tracers have an impact on long- term survival remain s to be studied.   \nF-18 sodium fluoride targets osteoblast activity where the fluoride is \ndeposited into new bone formation, thus limiting use of this agent to the detection of osseous metastases. Fluoride PET/CT has greater sensitivity  \nthan standard bone scintigraphy in the detection of bone metastases, with \n77% to 94% sensitivity, 92%  to 99% s pecificity, and 82%  to 97% PPV.\n210  \nHowever, emerging evidence indicates that other tracers such as PSMA \nare at least equivalent to fluoride in the detection of osseous metastases \nwith the added advantage of soft tissue metastasis detection.211 \nThe Panel believes that bone imaging can be achieved by conventional \ntechnetium -99m-MDP bone scan. Plain films, CT, MRI, or PET/CT or \nPET/MRI with F -18 sodium fluoride, C -11 choline,  F-18 fluciclovine , Ga-68 \nPSMA- 11, or F- 18 piflufolastat  PSMA can be considered for equivocal \nresults on initial bone imaging. Alternatively, Ga -68 PSMA- 11 or  F-18 \npiflufolastat  PSMA PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered for bone and \nsoft tissue (full body) imaging. 212- 215 \nHistologic or radiographic confirmation of involvement detected by PET \nimaging is recommended whenever feasible due to the presence of false \npositives. Although false positives exist, literature suggests that these are \noutweighed by the increase in true po sitives detected by PET relative to \nbone scintigraphy. To reduce the false -positive rate, physicians should \nconsider the intensity of PSMA -PET uptake and correlative CT findings in \nthe interpretation of scans. Several reporting systems have been proposed but will not have been validated or widely used.\n216,217 Moreover, although \nPET imaging may change treatment ,207 it may not change oncologic \noutcome.  Earlier  detection of bone metastatic disease, for instance, may \nresult in earlier use of newer and more expensive therapies, which may \nnot improve oncologic outcome s or OS.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-15 Risks of Imaging  \nAs with any medical procedure, imaging is not without risk. Some of these \nrisks are concrete and tangible, while others are less clear . Risks \nassociated with i maging include exposure to ionizing radiation, adverse \nreaction to contrast media, false- positive scans, and overdetection.  \nExposure to Ionizing Radiation  \nDeterministic and s tochastic are two types of effects from exposure to \nionizing radiation by x-ray, CT, or PET/CT. Deterministic effects are those \nthat occur at a certain dose level, and include events such as cataracts  \nand radiation burns. N o effect is seen below the dose threshold. Medical \nimaging is always performed almost below the threshold for deterministic \neffects. Stochastic effects tend to occur late, increase in likelihood as dose \nincreases, and have no known lower “safe” limit. The major stochastic \neffect of concern in medical imaging is radiation- induced malignancy. \nUnfortunately, no direct measurements are available to determine risk of \ncancer arising from one or more medical imaging events, so risks are \ncalculated using other models (such as  from survivors  of radiation \nexposure). The literature is conflicting with regard to the precise risk of \nsecondary malignancies in patients undergoing medical imaging \nprocedures. There is a small but finite risk of developing secondary \nmalignancies as a result of medical imaging procedures, and the risk is \ngreatest in young patients. However, the absolute risk of fatal malignancy \narising from a medical imaging procedure is very low,  and is difficult to \ndetect given the prevalence of cancer in the population and the multiple \nfactors that contribute to oncogenesis.218 Efforts should be made to \nminimize dose from these procedures,  which begin with judicious use of \nimaging only when justified by the clinical situation. H arm may arise from \nnot imaging a patient, through disease non -detection,  or from erroneous \nstaging.  Adverse Reaction to C ontrast Media \nMany imaging studies make use of contrast material  delivered by  oral, \nintravenous, or rectal routes. The use of contrast material  may improve  \nstudy performance, but reactions to contrast material may  occur and they \nshould be used only when warranted. Some patients develop adverse \nreactions to iodinated intravenous contrast material.  Most reactions are \nmild cutaneous reactions (eg , urticaria, pruritus ) but occasionally severe \nreactions can be life- threatening (bronchospasm  or anaphylaxis ). The risk \nof severe reaction is low  with non- ionic contrast materials.219 Both \niodinated CT contrast material and gadolinium -based MR contrast \nmaterials can be problematic in patients with reduced renal function. \nGadolinium MR contrast media, in particular, is contraindicated in patients \nwith acute renal failure or stage V chronic kidney disease ( glomerular \nfiltration rate [GFR ] <15).220 Patients in this category are significantly more \nlikely to develop nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Centers performing \nimaging studies with contrast materials should have policies in place to \naddress the use of contrast in these patients.  \nFalse- Positive Scans and Overdetection  \nEvery imaging test has limitations for sensiti vity, specificity, and accuracy \nthat involve both the nature of the imaging modality as well as the interpreting physician. Harm can arise when  a tumor or tumor recurrence \nis not detected (ie, false negative), but harm to the patient and added \nexpense to the medical system also can result from false- positive scans. \nExtensive workup of imaging findings that may otherwise be benign or indolent (ie, overdetection) can lead to signif icant patient anxiety, \nadditional  and unnecessary  imaging, and invasive procedures that carry  \ntheir own risk s for adverse outcomes .  \nAccurate and medically  relevant interpretation of imaging studies requires \nfamiliarity and expertise in the imaging modality, attention to detail in image review, knowledge of tumor biology, and familiarity with treatment PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-16 options and algorithms. Challenging cases are best addressed through \ndirect communication, either physician- to-physician or in a multidisciplinary  \ntumor board setting.  \nMedical imaging is a critical tool in the evaluation and comprehensive care  \nof patients with malignancy. However, as with any medical procedure, \nimaging is not without risks to patients. Inappropriate use of imaging also \nhas been identified as a significant contributor to health care costs in the \nUnited States  and worldwide. Therefore, imaging should be performed \nonly when medically appropriate, and in a manner that reduces risk (eg , \nminimizing radiation dose). An algorithmic approach to the use of imaging, \nsuch as by NCCN and the Appropriateness Criteria developed by the \nAmerican College of Radiology,221 can assist in medical decision- making.  \nObservation  \nObservation involves monitoring the course of prostate cancer  with a \nhistory and physical exam no more often than every  12 months (without \nsurveillance biopsies) until symptoms develop or are thought to be \nimminent. If patients under observation become symptomatic, an \nassessment of disease burden can be performed, and treatment or \npalliation can be considered.  Observation thus differs from active \nsurveillance. The goal of observation is to maintain quality of life ( QOL ) by \navoiding noncurative treatment when prostate cancer is unlikely to cause \nmortality or significant morbidity. The main advantage of observation is \navoidance of possible side effects of unnecessary definitive therapy or \nADT. However, patients may develop urinary retention or pathologic \nfracture without prior symptoms or increasing PSA level.  \nObservation is applicable to patients  who are older or frail  with comorbidity \nthat will likely out -compete prostate cancer for cause of death. Johansson \nand colleagues222 observed that only 13% of patients  developed \nmetastases 15 years after diagnosis of T0– T2 disease and only 11% had died from prostate cancer. Because prostate cancer will not be treated for \ncure for patients with shorter life expectancies, observation for as long as \npossible is a reasonable option based on physician discretion. Monitoring \nshould include PSA and physical exam  no more often than every 6 \nmonths, but will not involve surveillance biopsies  or radiographic imaging . \nWhen symptoms develop or are i mminent, patients can begin palliative \nADT.  \nActive Surveillance \nActive surveillance  (formerly referred to as watchful waiting, expectant \nmanagement, or deferred treatment ) involves actively monitoring the \ncourse of the disease with the expectation to deliver curative therapy if the \ncancer progresses.  Unlike observation, active surveillance is mainly \napplicable to younger patients  with seemingly indolent cancer with the \ngoal to defer  or avoid treatment and its potential side effects. Because \nthese patients have a longer life expectancy, they should be followed closely and treatment should start promptly should the cancer progress so \nas not to miss the chance for cure.  \nSeveral large active surveillance cohort studies have shown that between \n50% and 68% of those eligible for active surveillance may safely avoid \ntreatment , and thus the possible associated side effects of treatment,  for \nat least 10 years .\n223- 225 For example, i n one study, 55% of the population \nremained untreated at 15 years.224 Although a proportion of patients  on \nactive surveillance will eventually undergo treatment, the delay does not appear to impact cure rates, and numerous  studies have shown that active \nsurveillance can be a safe  option for many patients .\n223- 233 In fact, a 2015 \nmeta -analysis of 26 active surveillance cohort studies that included 7627 \npatients  identified only 8 prostate cancer deaths and 5 cases of \nmetastasis.234  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

However, a 12.2% absolute increase in the rate of disease progression and a 3.4% absolute increase in the rate  of \nmetastases or prostate cancer death were seen in the active surveillance \ngroup.\n235,236 Approximately 23% of participants had Gleason scores 7– 10, \nand 5 of 8 deaths in the active surveillance group were in this subset. \nPatient -reported outcomes were compared among the 3 groups.237 The \noperation group experienced the greatest negative effect on sexual \nfunction and urinary continence, whereas bowel function was worst in the \nradiation group.  \nIn addition, studies have shown that active surveillance does not adversely \nimpact psychological well -being or QOL.237- 242 \nThe proportion of patients  with low- risk prostate cancer choosing active \nsurveillance in the Veterans Affairs Integrated Health Care System  \nincreased from 2005 to 2015: from 4% to 39% of those <65 years and \nfrom 3% to 41% of those  ≥65 years.243 An analysis of the SEER database \nfound a similar trend, with the use of active surveillance in patients  with \nlow-risk prostate cancer increasing from 14.5% in 2010 to 42.1% in \n2015.244 An international, hospital -based, retrospective analysis of greater \nthan 115,000 patients  with low- risk prostate cancer reported that active \nsurveillance utilization increased, but the proportions were lower at 7 % in \n2010 and 20% in 2014.245  \nUltimately, a recommendation for active surveillance must be based on \ncareful individualized weighing of a number of factors: life expectancy, \ngeneral health condition,  disease characteristics, potential side effects of treatment, and patient preference.  Shared decision- making, after \nappropriate counseling on the risks and benefits of the various options, is \ncritical.  \nThe panel  believes there is an urgent need for further clinical research \nregarding the criteria for recommending active surveillance, the criteria for \nreclassification  on active surveillance,  and the schedule for active \nsurveillance especially as it pertains to prostate biopsies, which pose  an \nincreasing burden. One important ongoing study  that can help answer \nthese questions  is the prospective multi -institutional  Canary PASS cohort \nstudy, which has been funded by the NCI.230 Nine hundred five patients , \nmedian age 63 years and median follow -up 28 months, demonstrated 19% \nconversion to therapy. Much should be learned about the criteria for \nselection of and progression on active surveillance as this cohort and \nresearch effort mature.  \nRationale  \nThe NCCN Guidelines P anel remains  concerned about the problems of \novertreatment related to the increased frequency of diagnosis of prostate \ncancer from widespread use of PSA for early detection or screening (see \nthe NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection, available at \nwww.NCCN.org ).  \nThe debate about the need to diagnose and treat every individual  who has \nprostate cancer is fueled by  the high prevalence of prostate cancer upon \nautopsy of the prostate246; the high frequency of positive prostate biopsies \nin individuals  with normal DREs and serum PSA values247; the contrast \nbetween the incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer; and the \nneed to treat an estimated 37 patients  with screen -detected prostate \ncancer248,249 or 100 patients  with low- risk prostate cancer250 to prevent one \ndeath from the disease.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-18 been further informed by publication of the Goteborg study, a subset of the \nEuropean Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer \n(ERSPC).255,256 Many believe that this study best approximates proper use \nof PSA for early detection because it was population- based and involved a \n1:1 randomization of 20,000 participants  who received PSA every 2 years \nand used threshol ds for prostate biopsy of PSA > 3 and >2.5 since 2005. \nThe 14-year follow -up reported in 2010 was longer than the European \nstudy as a whole (9 years) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and \nOvarian (PLCO) trial (11.5 years). Prostate cancer was diagnosed in \n12.7% of the screened group compared to 8.2% of the control group. \nProstate cancer mortality was 0.5% in the screened group and 0.9% in the \ncontrol group, which gave a 40% absolute cumulative risk reduction of  \nprostate cancer death (compared to ERSPC 20% and PLCO 0%).255 Most \nimpressively, 40% of the patients were initially on active surveillance and \n28% were still on active surveillance at the time these results were \nanalyzed. To prevent a prostate cancer death, 12 individuals  would need \nto be diagnosed and treated as opposed to the ERSPC as a whole where \n37 individuals  needed to be treated. Analysis of 18 -year follow -up data \nfrom the Goteborg study reduced the number needed to be diagnosed to \nprevent 1 prostate cancer death to 10.257 Thus, early detection,  when \napplied properly , should reduce prostate cancer mortality. However, that \nreduction comes at the expense of overtreatment  that may occur in as \nmany as 50% of patients  treated for PSA -detected prostate cancer.258  \nThe best models of prostate cancer detection and progression estimate \nthat 23% to 42% of all U.S. screen- detected cancers were overtreated259 \nand that PSA detection was responsible for up to 12.3 years of lead- time \nbias.260 The NCCN Guidelines Panel responded to these evolving data \nwith careful consideration of which patients  should be recommended \nactive surveillance. However, the NCCN Guidelines Panel recognizes the uncertainty associated with the estimation of chance of competing causes \nof death; the definition of very -low-, low-, and favorable intermediate -risk prostate cancer; the ability to detect disease progression without \ncompromising chance of cure; and the chance and consequences of \ntreatment side effects.  \nPatient Selection  \nEpstein and colleagues\n261 introduced clinical criteria to predict \npathologically “insignificant” prostate cancer. Insignificant , or very -low-risk, \nprostate cancer is identified by: clinical stage T1c, biopsy Grade Group 1 , \nthe presence of disease in fewer than 3 biopsy cores, ≤50% prostate cancer involvement in any core, and PSA density <0.15 ng/mL/g. Despite \nthe usefulness of these criteria, physicians are cautioned against using \nthese as the sole decision maker. Studies have shown that as many as \n8% of cancers that qualified as i nsignificant using the Epstein criteria were \nnot organ- confined based on post operative findings.\n262,263 A new \nnomogram may be better.264 Although many variations upon this definition \nhave been proposed (reviewed by Bastian and colleagues265), a \nconsensus of the NCCN Guidelines Panel was reached that insignificant \nprostate cancer, especially when detected early using serum PSA, poses \nlittle threat to individuals  with a life expectancy of less than 20 years. The \nconfidence that Americans with very -low-risk prostate cancer have a very \nsmall risk of prostate cancer death is enhanced by lead time bias \nintroduced by PSA early detection that ranges from an estimated 12.3 \nyears in a 55 -year-old individual  to 6 years in a 75- year-old individual .260  \nAt this time, the NCCN Panel consensus is that active surveillance i s \npreferred for all patients  with very -low-risk prostate cancer and life \nexpectancy greater than 10 years .  \nActive Surveillance in Low -Risk Disease  \nPanel consensus is that active surveillance is preferred for most patients \nwith low- risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy greater than or equal to \n10 years.

After longer follow -up \n(median 12.7 years), a small difference was seen in all -cause mortality in \nthose with intermediate -risk disease ( absolute difference, 14.5 percentage \npoints; 95% CI, 2.8– 25.6), but not in those with low -risk disease ( absolute \ndifference, 0.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -10.5– 11.8).271 Urinary \nincontinence and erectile and sexual dysfunction, however, were worse \nthrough 10 years in the radical prostatectomy group. These results and the \nless-than- average health of participants  in the PIVOT study272 suggest that \npatients  with competing risks may safely be offered active surveillance.  \nOther prospective studies of active surveillance that included patients  with \nintermediate- risk prostate cancer resulted in favorable prostate cancer -specific survival rates of 94% to 100% for the full cohorts.224,227,228  \nHowever, with extended follow -up, the Toronto group has demonstrated \ninferior metastasis -free survival for patients  with intermediate- risk prostate \ncancer (15- year metastasis -free survival for cases of Gleason 6 or less \nwith PSA <10 ng/m L, 94%; Gleason 6 or less with PSA 10–20 ng/m L, \n94%; Gleason 3+4 with PSA 20 ng/m L or less , 84%; and Gleason 4+3 \nwith PSA 20 ng/m L or less , 63%).273  \nOverall, t he Panel interpreted these data to show that a subset of patients  \nwith favorable intermediate- risk prostate cancer and life expectancy \ngreater than 10 years  may be considered for active surveillance. However, \nthe precise inclusion criteria and follow -up protocols need continued \nrefinement . Patients  must understand that a significant proportion of those  \nclinically staged as having favorable intermediate -risk prostate cancer may \nhave higher risk disease.274- 277 Particular consideration to active \nsurveillance may be appropriate for those patients with a low percentage of Gleason pattern 4 cancer, low tumor volume, low PSA density, and/or \nlow genomic risk (from tissue- based molecular tumor analysis) , but should \nbe approached with caution, include informed decision- making, and use \nclose monitoring for progression.  \nRole of Race in Decisions Regarding Active Surveillance \nRace is emerging as an important factor to consider when contemplating \nactive surveillance, particularly for African- American patients . A CDC \nanalysis of population- based cancer registries found that from 2003 to \n2017, the incidence of prostate cancer was higher in black individuals  than \nin white individuals , Hispanic individuals , American Indian/Alaska n atives, \nand Asian/Pacific i slanders .278 Five-year survival for all stages combined \nwas higher for white patients  than for black or H ispanic patients , but \nsurvival for distant stage disease was higher for b lack patients  than white \npatients .

Compared to Caucasian Americans \nmatched on clinical parameters, African Americans have been reported to \nhave a 1.7- to 2.3 -fold higher change of pathologic upgrading.281,282 \nHowever, other studies have not seen different rates of upstaging or \nupgrading.283,284 For example, in a retrospective study of 895 patients  in the \nSEARCH  database, no significant differences were seen in the rates of \npathologic upgrading, upstaging,  or biochemical recurrence  between \nAfrican American and Caucasian Americans.283  \nSeveral studies have reported that, among patients  with low- risk prostate \ncancer who are enrolled in active surveillance programs, African \nAmerica ns have higher risk of disease progression to higher Gleason \ngrade or volume cancer than Caucasian Americans.285- 288 African \nAmericans in the low - to intermediate- risk categories also appear to suffer \nfrom an increased risk of biochemical recurrence after treatment .289 In \naddition, African American patients  with low-risk or favorable intermediate-\nrisk prostate cancer have an increase in all -cause mortality after \ntreatment, mainly due to cardiovascular complications after ADT.290  \nReasons for these clinical disparities are under investigation, but treatment \ndisparities and access to health care may play a significant role.291,292 In \nfact, results of some studies suggest that racial disparities in prostate \ncancer outcomes are minimized when health care access is equal.293- 296 \nStrategies to improve risk -stratification for African Americans considering \nactive surveillance may include mpMRI in concert with targeted image -\nguided biopsies, which have been reported to improve detection of \nclinically significant tumors in some individuals .297 Confirmatory Testing  \nConfirmatory testing can help facilitate early identification of those patients who may be at a higher risk of future grade reclassification or cancer \nprogression. Since an initial prostate biopsy may underestimate tumor \ngrade or volume, confirmatory testi ng is strongly recommended within the \nfirst 6 to 12 months of diagnosis for patients  who are considering active \nsurveillance.  \nBefore starting on an active surveillance program, mpMRI  with calculation \nof PSA density  should be considered to confirm candidacy for active \nsurveillance if not performed during initial workup .\n298 Patients  with PI -\nRADS 4 or 5 on mpMRI have an increased risk of biopsy progression \nduring active surveillance.299  \nIn patients with low and favorable intermediate risk, molecular tumor analysis can also be considered before deciding whether to pursue active \nsurveillance (see Tumor Multigene Molecular Testing, above) . One study \nexamined the role of molecular tumor analysis  for predicting upgrading  on \nsurveillance biopsy or the presence of adverse pathology on eventual \nradical prostatectomy in patients in an active surveillance cohort.\n156 In this \nstudy, results of the molecular testing did not significantly improve risk \nstratification over the use of clinical variables alone.  \nIf results of mpMRI and/or molecular testing are concerning, a repeat \nbiopsy may be appropriate.  \nEarly confirmatory testing may not be necessary in patients who have had \na complete workup including mpMRI prior to diagnostic biopsy, advanced \nPSA- based bloodwork, and/or molecular tumor analysis. However, all \npatients should undergo  a confirmatory  prostate biopsy within 1 to 2 years \nof their diagnostic biopsy.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-21 Active Surveillance Program  \nThe current NCCN recommendations for the active surveillance program \ninclude PSA no more often than every 6 months unless clinically indicated; \nDRE no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated; \nrepeat  prostate biopsy no more often than every 12 months unless \nclinically indicated; and repeat mpMRI no more often than every 12 \nmonths unless clinically ind icated.  Repeat molecular tumor analysis is \ndiscouraged during active surveillance. Results of a study of 211 patients \nwith Grade Group 1 prostate cancer who had initial and repeat mpMRIs \nand PSA monitoring suggest that a negative initial mpMRI predicts a low \nrisk of Gleason upgrading by systematic biopsy.300 In addition, PSA \nvelocity was significantly associated with subsequent progression in those \nwith an initial negative mpMRI. In contrast, those with high- risk visible \nlesions on mpMRI before initiation of active surveillance had an increased \nrisk of progression. A meta -analysis of 43 studies found the sensitivity  and \nNPV for mpMRI to be  0.81 and 0.78, respectively.301 An analysis of \npatients in Canary PASS found that mpMRI had a n NPV and PPV for \ndetecting Grade Group ≥ 2 cancer of 83% and 31%, respectively.302 \nAnother study found the NPV of mpMRI to be 80%.303 \nWhereas the intensity of surveillance may be tailored on an individual \nbasis (eg, based on life expectancy and risk of reclassification), most \npatients should have prostate biopsies incorporated as part of their \nmonitoring , but no more often than every 12 months, because PSA \nkinetics may not be reliable for predicting progression. Repeat biopsy is \nuseful to determine whether higher Gleason grade exists, which may \ninfluence prognosis and hence the decision to continue active s urveillance \nor proceed to defini tive local therapy.304 A repeat prostate biopsy should \nalso be considered if the prostate exam changes, if mpMRI (if done) \nsuggests more aggressive disease, or if PSA increases. However, \nliterature suggests that as many as 7% of patients undergoing prostate \nbiopsy will suffer an adverse event,252 and those who develop urinary tract infection are often fluoroquinolone- resistant.305 Radical prostatectomy may \nbecome technically challenging after multiple sets of biopsies, especially \nas it pertains to potency preservation.306 Therefore, m any clinicians choose \nto wait 2 years for a biopsy if there are no signs of progression.  \nIf the PSA level increases and systematic prostate biopsy remains \nnegative, mpMRI may be considered to exclude the presence of anterior \ncancer.307  \nIn patients with a suspicious lesion on mpMRI, MRI -US fusion biopsy \nimproves the detection of higher grade (Grade Group ≥2) cancers. Early \nexperience supports the utilization of mpMRI in biopsy protocols to better \nrisk stratify patients under active survei llance.308- 310 However, more recent \nstudies have shown that a significant proportion of high- grade cancers are \ndetected with systematic biopsy and not targeted biopsy in patients on \nactive surveillance.311- 313 \nPatients should be transitioned to observation (see Observation , above) \nwhen life expectancy is less than 10 years.  \nConsiderations for Treatment o f Patients on Active Surveillance   \nReliable parameters of prostate cancer progression await the results of \nongoing clinical trials. PSADT is not considered reliable enough to be used \nalone to detect disease progression.314 If repeat biopsy shows Grade \nGroup ≥3 disease, or if tumor is found in a greater number of biopsy cores \nor in a higher percentage of a given biopsy core, cancer progression may \nhave occurred.  Grade reclassification on repeat biopsy is the most \ncommon factor influencing a change in management from active surveillance to  treatment.  Other factors affecting decisions to actively treat \ninclude: increase in tumor volume, a rise in PSA density, as well as patient anxiety.  Considerations for a change in management  strategy should be \nmade in the context of the patient’s life expectancy.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-22 Each of the major active surveillance series has used different criteria for \nreclassification.223,224,229- 232,315- 318 Reclassification criteria were  met by 23% \nof patients  with a median follow -up of 7 years in the Toronto experience,316 \n36% of patients  with a median follow -up of 5  years in the Johns Hopkins \nexperience,223 and 16% of patients  with a median follow -up of 3.5  years in \nthe University of California, San Francisco ( UCSF ) experience232 (Table 3). \nUncertainty regarding reclassification  criteria and the desire to avoid \nmissing an opportunity for cure drove  several reports that dealt with the \nvalidity of commonly used reclassification  criteria. The Toronto group \ndemonstrated that a PSA trigger point of PSA DT less than 3 years could \nnot be improved upon by using a PSA threshold of 10 or 20, PSA DT \ncalculated in various ways, or PSA velocity greater than 2 ng/m L/y.319 The \nJohns Hopkins group used biopsy -demonstrated reclassification  to \nGleason pattern 4 or 5 or increased tumor volume on biopsy as their \ncriteria  for reclassification . Of 290 patients  on an annual prostate biopsy \nprogr am, 35% demonstrated reclassification at a median follow -up of 2.9 \nyears.320 Neither PSADT  (area under the curve [ AUC], 0.59) nor PSA \nvelocity (AUC,  0.61) was associated with prostate biopsy reclassification . \nBoth groups have concluded that PSA kinetics cannot replace regular prostate biopsy , although treatment of most patients  who demonstrate \nreclassification  on prostate biopsy prevents evaluation of biopsy \nreclassification as a criterion for trea tment or reduction of survival. \nTreatment of all patients  who developed Gleason pattern 4 on annual \nprostate biopsies has thus far resulted in only 2 prostate cancer deaths \namong 1298 patients  (0.15%) in the Johns Hopkins study.\n223 However, it \nremains uncertain whether treatment of all who progressed to Gleason \npattern 4 was necessary. Studies remain in progress to identify the best \ntrigger points when interventions with curative intent may still be \nsuccessful.  \nThe Toront o group published findings on three patients who died of \nprostate cancer in their experience with 450 patients  on active surveillance.316 These three deaths led them to revise their criteria for \noffering active surveillance,  because each of these three  patients  probably \nhad metastatic disease at the time of entry on active surveillance. The 450 \npatients  were  followed for a median of 6.8 years ; OS was 78.6% and \nprostate cancer -specific survival was 97.2%.316 Of the 30% (n  = 145) of \npatients  who progressed, 8% had  an increase in Gleason grade, 14% had \na PSADT  less than 3 years, 1% developed a prostate nodule, and 3% \nwere treated because of  anxiety. One hundred thirty -five of these 145 \npatients  were treated:  35 by radical prostatectomy, 90 by EBRT  with or \nwithout ADT, and 10 with ADT  alone. Follow -up is available for 110 of \nthese patients , and 5- year biochemical PFS is 62% for those undergoing \nradical prostatectomy and 43% for those undergoing radiation.  Longer -\nterm follow -up of this cohort was reported in 2015.224 The 10-  and 15 -year \nactuarial cause -specific survival rates for the entire cohort were 98.1% and \n94.3%, respectively.  Only 15 of 993 (1.5%) patients had died of prostate \ncancer, an additional  13 patients  (1.3%) had  developed metastatic \ndisease,  and only 36.5 % of the cohort had received treatment  by 10 years . \nIn an analysis of 592  patients enrolled in this cohort  who had 1 or more \nrepeat prostate biopsies, 31.3% of cases were upgraded. Fifteen percent  \nof upgraded cases were upgraded to Gleason ≥8, and 62% of total \nupgraded cases proceeded to active treatment.321 Another analysis of this \ncohort revealed that metastatic disease developed in 13 of 133 patients  \nwith Gleason 7 disease (9.8%) and 17 of 847 patients  with Gleason ≤6 \ndisease (2.0%).322 PSADT and the number of positive scores were also \npredictors of increased risk for the development of metastatic disease.  \nIn comparison, among 192 patients  on active surveillance who underwent \ndelayed treatment at a median of 2 years  after diagnosis in the Johns \nHopkins experience, 5- year biochemical PFS was 96% for those who \nunderwent radical prostatectomy and 75% for those who underwent radiation.\n318 The two groups were similar by pathologic  Gleason grade, \npathologic stage, and margin positivity.

However, because of potential \nperioperative morbidity, radical prostatectomy should generally be \nreserved for patients whose life expectancy is 10 years or more. \nStephenson and colleagues\n121 reported a low 15- year prostate cancer -\nspecific mortality of 12% in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (5% for patients  with low- risk disease), although it is unclear whether the \nfavorable prognosis is due to the effectiveness of the procedure or the low lethality of cancers detected in the PSA era.  \nRadical prostatectomy was compared to watchful waiting in a randomized trial of 695 patients with early -stage prostate cancer (mostly T2).\n326,327 With \na median follow -up of 12.8 years, those assigned to the radical \nprostatectomy group had significant improvements in disease- specific \nsurvival, OS, and risk of metastasis and local progression.326 The reduction \nin mortality was confirmed at 18 years of follow -up, with an absolute \ndifference of 11%.327 Overall, 8 patients  needed to be treated to avert one \ndeath; that number fell to 4 for patients  <65 years of age. Longer follow -up \nresults were also reported, in which t he cumulative incidence of death \nfrom prostate cancer was 19.6% and 31.3% in the radical  prostatectomy \nand watchful  waiting groups, respectively,  at 23 years, with a mean \nincrease of 2.9 years of life in the radical prostatectomy group.328 The results of this trial offer high- quality evidence to support radical \nprostatectomy as a treatment option for clinically localized prostate cancer.  \nSome patients at high or very high risk may benefit from radical \nprostatectomy. In an analysis of 842 patients  with Gleason scores 8 to 10 \nat biopsy who underwent radical prostatectomy, predictors of unfavorable \noutcome included PSA level over 10 ng/mL, clinical stage T2b or higher, \nGleason score 9 or 10, higher number of biopsy cores with high- grade \ncancer, and o ver 50% core involvement.329 Patients without these \ncharacteristics showed higher 10- year biochemical -free and disease -\nspecific survival after radical prostatectomy compared to those with unfavorable findings (31% vs. 4% and 75% vs. 52%, respectively). Radical \nprostatectomy is an opt ion for patients  with high -risk disease and in select \npatients with very -high- risk disease.  \nRetrospective data and population- based studies suggest that r adical \nprostatectomy  with PLND can be an effective option for patients with cN1  \ndisease.\n330- 332 Extrapolation of results of STAMPEDE arm H , in which \nEBRT to the primary tumor improved OS  and other endpoints  in patients \nwith low- volume metastatic  disease,  also suggests that local treatment to \nthe prostate may be beneficial in patients with advanced disease.333 \nRadical prostatectomy is a treatment option for patients experiencing \nbiochemical recurrence after primary EBRT, but m orbidity (incontinence, \nerectile dysfunction, and bladder neck contracture) remains significantly \nhigher than when radical prostatectomy is used as initial therapy.334,335 \nOverall and cancer -specific 10-year survival ranged from 54% to 89% and \n70% to 83%, respectively.334 Patient selection is important , and post-RT \nrecurrence radical prostatectomy should only be performed by highly \nexperienced surgeons.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-24 Operative Techniques and Adverse Effects  \nLong- term cancer control has been achieved in most patients with both the \nretropubic and the perineal approaches to radical prostatectomy; high-\nvolume surgeons in high- volume centers generally achieve superior \noutcomes.336,337 Laparoscopic and robot -assisted radical prostatectomy are \ncommonly used and are considered comparable to conventional \napproaches in experienced hands.338- 340 In a cohort study using SEER \nMedicare- linked data on 8837 patients, minimally invasive compared to \nopen radical prostatectomy  was associated with shorter length of hospital \nstay, less need for blood transfusions, and fewer surgical complications, \nbut rates of incontinence and erectile dysfunction were higher.341 A second \nlarge study reported no difference in overall complications, readmission, \nand additional cancer therapies  between open and robot -assisted radical \nprostatectomy, although the robotic approach  was associated with higher \nrates of genitourinary complications and lower rates of blood \ntransfusion.342 Oncologic outcome of a robotic versus open approach was \nsimilar when assessed by use of additional therapies341 or rate of positive \nsurgical margins,343 although longer follow -up is necessary. A meta-\nanalysis on 19 observational studies (n = 3893 ) reported less blood loss \nand lower transfusion rates with minimally invasive techniques than with \nopen operation.343 Risk of positive surgical margins was the same. Two \nmore recent meta -analyses showed a statistically significant advantage in \nfavor of a robotic approach compared to an open approach in 12 -month \nurinary continence344 and potency recovery.345 Early results from a \nrandomiz ed controlled phase 3 study  comparing r obot-assisted \nlaparoscopic  radical  prostatectomy and open radical retropubic \nprostatectomy  in 326 patients  were published in 2016.346,347 Urinary \nfunction and sexual function scores and rates of postoperative \ncomplications did not differ significantly between the groups  at 6, 12, and \n24 months after surgery. Rates of positive surgical margins were similar, based on a superiority test (10% in the open group vs. 15% in the robotic \ngroup). Assessment of oncologic outcomes  from this trial will be limited because postoperative management and additional cancer therapies were \nnot standardized between the groups.\n346 \nAn analysis of the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study  on 1655 patients  with \nlocalized prostate cancer compared long -term functional outcomes after \nradical prostatectomy or EBRT.348 At 2 and 5 years, patients who \nunderwent radical prostatectomy reported higher rates of urinary \nincontinence and erectile dysfunction but lower rates of bowel urgency. \nHowever, no significant difference was observed at 15 years. In a large \nretrospective c ohort study involving 32,465 patients, those who received \nEBRT had a lower 5- year incidence of urologic procedures than those who \nunderwent radical prostatectomy , but higher incidence for hospital \nadmissions, rectal or anal procedures, open surgical procedures, and \nsecondary malignancies.349  \nReturn of urinary continence after radical prostatectomy may be improved \nby preserving the urethra beyond the prostatic apex and by avoiding \ndamage to the distal sphincter mechanism. Bladder neck preservation \nmay allow more rapid recovery of urinary control.350 Anastomotic strictures \nthat increase the risk of long- term incontinence are less frequent with \nmodern surgical techniques. Recovery of erectile function is related directly to the degree of preservation of the cavernous nerves, age at \nsurgery, and preoper ative erectile function. Improvement in urinary and \nsexual function has been reported with nerve- sparing techniques.\n351,352 \nReplacement of resected nerves with nerve grafts does not appear to be \neffective for patients undergoing wide resection of the neurovascular \nbundles.353 The ability of mpMRI to detect extracapsular extension can aid \nin decision- making in nerve- sparing surgery.171  \nPelvic Lymph Node Dissection  \nThe decision to perform PLND  should be guided by the probability of nodal \nmetastases.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-25 PLND because this avoids 47.7% of PLNDs at a cost of missing 12.1% of \npositive pelvic lymph nodes.126 A more recent analysis of 26,713 patients \nin the SEER database treated with radical prostatectomy and PLND \nbetween 2010 and 2013 found that the 2% nomogram threshold would \navoid 22.3% of PLNDs  at a cost of missing 3.0% of positive pelvic lymph \nnodes.354 The Panel recommends use of a nomogram developed at \nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  that uses pretreatment PSA, \nclinical stage , and Gleason sum  to predict the risk of pelvic lymph node \nmetastases.126 \nPLND should be performed using an extended  technique.355,356 An \nextended PLND includes removal of all node- bearing tissue from an area \nbounded by the external iliac vein anteriorly, the pelvic side wall laterally, \nthe bladder wall medially, the floor of the pelvis posteriorly, Cooper’s \nligament distally, and the internal iliac artery proximally. Removal of more \nlymph nodes using the extended technique has been associated with \nincreased likelihood of finding lymph node metastases, thereby providing \nmore complete staging.357-359 A survival advantage with more extensive \nlymphadenectomy has been suggested by several studies, possibly due to \nelimination of microscopic metastases,358,360- 362 although definitive proof of \noncologic benefit is lacking.363 PLND can be performed safely \nlaparoscopically, robotically, or as an open procedure, and complication \nrates should be similar among the three approaches.  \nRadiation Therapy  \nRT techniques used in prostate cancer include EBRT, proton radiation, \nand brachytherapy. EBRT techniques include IMRT and hypofractionated, \nimage- guided SBRT. An analysis that included propensity -score matching \nof patients showed that, among younger patients  with prostate cancer, \nstereotactic body RT ( SBRT ) and intensity -modulated RT ( IMRT ) had \nsimilar toxicity profiles  whereas  proton radiation was associated with \nreduced urinary toxicity and increased bowel toxicity . The cost of proton therapy was almost double that of IMRT , and SBRT was slightly  less \nexpensive.364 \nThe panel believes that highly conformal RT (CRT) techniques should be used to treat localized prostate cancer. Photon and proton beam radiation \nare both effective at achieving highly CRT with acceptable and similar \nbiochemical control and long- term side e ffect profiles. Radiation \ntechniques are discussed in more detail below.  \nExternal Beam Radiation Therapy  \nOver the past several decades, EBRT techniques have evolved to allow higher doses of radiation to be administered safely. Three- dimensional \n(3D) CRT (3D- CRT) uses computer software to integrate CT images of the \npatients’ internal anatomy in the treatment position, which allows  higher \ncumulative doses to be delivered with lower risk of late effects.\n137,365- 367 The \nsecond- generation 3D technique,  IMRT, has been used increasingly in \npractice .368 IMRT reduce d the risk of gastrointestinal toxicities and rates of \npost-recurrence  therapy compared to 3D -CRT in some but not all older \nretrospective and population- based studies, although treatment cost is \nincreased.369- 372  \nMore recently, moderately hypofractionated image- guided IMRT regimens \n(2.4– 4 Gy per fraction over 4– 6 weeks) have been tested in randomized \ntrials, and their efficacy has been similar or non -inferior to conventionally \nfractionated IMRT, with one trial show ing fewer treatment failures with a \nmoderately fractionated regimen.373- 382 Toxicity was similar between \nmoderately hypofractionated and conventional regimens in some373,377,380,381 \nbut not all of the trials.375,378,379 In addition, efficacy results varied among the \ntrials, with some showing noninferiority or similar efficacy and others \nshowing that hypofractionation may be less effective than conventional \nfractionation schemes. These safety and efficacy differences are likely a \nresult of differences in fractionation schedules.383 In addition, results of a PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-26 large cohort study showed no differences in QOL  or urinary or bowel \nfunction between those that received hypofractionated versus \nconventional regimens.384 Overall, the panel believes that hypofractionated \nIMRT techniques, which are more convenient for patients, can be \nconsidered as an alternative to conventionally fractionated regimens when \nclinically indicated. The panel lists fractionation schemes that hav e shown \nacceptable efficacy and toxicity on PROS -F page 3 of 5 in the algorithm \nabove. An ASTRO/ ASCO /AUA evidence -based guideline regarding the \nuse of hypofractionated radiation in patients  with localized prostate cancer  \nconcluded that moderately fractionated regimens are justified for routine \nuse in this setting and provides more detail on the topic.385 \nDaily prostate localization using image -guided RT (IGRT) is essential with \neither 3D -CRT or IMRT for target margin reduction and treatment \naccuracy. Imaging techniques, such as  ultrasound, implanted fiducials, \nelectromagnetic targeting and tracking, or endorectal balloon, can improv e \ncure rates and decrease  complications.  \nThese techniques have permitted safer dose escalation, and results of randomized trials have suggested that dose escalation is associated with \nimproved biochemical outcomes.\n386- 391 Kuban and colleagues389 published \nan analysis of  their dose -escalation trial of 301 patients with stage T1b to \nT3 prostate cancer. F reedom from biochemical or clinical recurrence was \nhigher in the group randomized to 78 Gy compared to 70 Gy (78% vs . \n59%, P = .004)  at a median follow -up of 8.7 years. The difference was \neven greater among patients with diagnostic  PSA >10 ng/mL (78% vs . \n39%, P = .001).  A longer follow -up (mean 14.3 years) found that \nimprovements in biochemical and clinical recurrences were sustained, with \nlower rate s of additional cancer treatment and better prostate  cancer -\nspecific mortality.392 OS was not improved.  \nAn analysis of the National Cancer Datab ase found that dose escalation \n(75.6– 90 Gy ) resulted in a dose- dependent improvement in OS for patients  with intermediate - or high- risk prostate cancer.393 In light of these \nfindings, the conventional 70 Gy dose is no longer cons idered adequate. A \ndose of 75.6 to 79.2 Gy in conventional fractions to the prostate (with or \nwithout seminal vesicles) is appropriate for patients with low -risk cancers. \nPatients Intermediate- risk and high- risk disease should receive doses of \nup to 81.0 Gy.369,394,395 \nData suggested that EBRT and radical prostatectomy were effective for the treatment of localized prostate cancer.\n396 EBRT of the primary prostate \ncancer shows several distinct advantages over radical prostatectomy. \nEBRT avoids complications associated with operation, such as bleeding \nand transfusion -related effects, and risks associated with anesthesia, such \nas myocardi al infarction and pulmonary embolus. 3D -CRT and IMRT \ntechniques are widely available and are possible for patients over a wide \nrange of ages. EBRT has a low risk of urinary incontinence and stricture \nand a good chance of short -term preservation of erectile function.397  \nThe disadvantages of EBRT include a treatment course of 8 to 9 weeks. \nUp to 50% of patients have some temporary bladder or bowel symptoms \nduring treatment. There is a low but definite risk of protracted rectal \nsymptoms from radiation proctitis, and the ris k of erectile dysfunction \nincreases over time.397,398 The risk of late rectal complications following RT \nis related to the volume of the rectum receiving doses of radiation close to \nor exceeding the radiation dose required to control the primary tumor.  \nBiomaterials have been developed, tested, and FDA approved to serve as \nspacer materials when inserted between the rectum and prostate.399,400 In a \nrandomized phase 3  multicenter clinical trial of patients undergoing image -\nguided IMRT (IG -IMRT) , where the risk of late (3 -year)  common \nterminology criteria for adverse events  (CTCAE ) was grade 2 or higher, \nphysician- recorded rectal complications declined from 5.7% to 0% in the \ncontrol versus hydrogel spacer group.401 The hydrogel spacer group had a \nsignificant reduction in bowel QOL decline.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-27 adverse events were noted in those receiving hydrogel  placement versus \ncontrols. Results of a secondary analysis of this trial suggest that use of a \nperirectal spacer may decrease the sexual side effects of radiation.402 \nSpacer implantation, however, is quite expensive and may be associated \nwith rare complications such as rectum perforation and urethral \ndamage.403,404 Retrospective data also support its use in similar patients \nundergoing brachytherapy. Overall, the panel believes that biocompatible \nand biodegradable perirectal spacer materials may be implanted between \nthe prostate and rectum in patients undergoing external radiotherapy with \norgan- confined prostate cancer in order to displace the rectum f rom high \nradiation dose regions. Patients with obvious rectal invasion or visible T3 and posterior extension should not undergo perirectal spacer implantation.  \nIf the cancer recurs, radical prostatectomy after RT is associated with a \nhigher risk of complications than primary radical prostatectomy.\n405 \nContraindications to EBRT include prior pelvic irradiation, active inflammatory disease of the rectum, or a permanent indwelling Foley \ncatheter. Relative contraindications include very low bladder capacity, \nchronic moderate or severe diarrhea, bladder out let obstruction requiring a \nsuprapubic catheter, and inactive ulcerative colitis.   \nEBRT for Early Disease  \nEBRT is one of the principal treatment options for clinically localized prostate cancer. The NCCN Guidelines Panel consensus was that modern \nEBRT and surgical series show similar PFS in patients with low -risk \ndisease treated with radical prostatectomy or E BRT. In a study of 3546 \npatients treated with brachytherapy plus EBRT, disease- free survival \n(DFS) remained steady at 73% between 15 and 25 years of follow -up.\n406 \nThe panel lists several acceptable dosing schemas in the guidelines. The NRG Oncology/RTOG 0126 randomized clinical trial  compared 79.2 Gy \n(44 fractions ) and 70.2 Gy (39 fractions ), both in 1.8 Gy fractions, in 1499 \npatients  with intermediate -risk prostate cancer.\n407 After a median follow -up of 8.4 years, the escalated dose reduced biochemical recurrences, but \nincreased late toxicity and had no effect on OS.  \nEBRT for Patients with High -Risk or Very -High -Risk Disease  \nEBRT has demonstrated efficacy in patients with high- risk and very -high-\nrisk prostate cancer. One  study randomized 415 patients to EBRT alone or \nEBRT plus 3- year ADT.408 In another  study (RTOG 8531), 977 patients \nwith T3 disease treated with EBRT were randomized to adjuvant ADT or \nADT at relapse.409 Two other randomized phase 3  trials evaluated long -\nterm ADT with or without radiation in a population of patients  who mostly \nhad T3 disease .410- 413 In all four studies, the combination group showed \nimproved disease- specific survival and OS compar ed to single- modality \ntreatment. Patients with a PSA nadir > 0.5 ng/mL after radiation and  6 \nmonths of ADT have an adjusted HR for all- cause mortality of 1.72  (95% \nCI, 1.17 –2.52; P = .01 ) compared with patients who received radiation \nonly.414  \nProphylactic nodal radiation should be considered  in this population.  415- 417 \nThe randomized controlled phase 3 POP -RT trial showed that pelvic \nradiation can improve biochemical failure -free survival (FFS) and DFS \ncompared with prostate -only radiation in patients with high - and very -high-\nrisk prostate cancer.418 The randomized phase 3 FLAME trial showed that \na focal radiation boost to the mpMRI -visible lesion can improve \nbiochemical DFS in this population.419 \nSome earlier data suggest ed that the use of docetaxel in combination with \nADT and EBRT may benefit fit patients with high - and very -high- risk \nlocalized disease. The GETUG 12 trial randomized 413 patients with high-  \nor very -high- risk prostate cancer to IMRT and ADT or ADT, docetaxel, and \nestramustine.420 After a median follow -up of 8.8 years, 8- year relapse- free \nsurvival was 62% in the combination therapy arm and 50% in the ADT -\nonly arm (adjusted HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54– 0.94; P = .017).

Improvements were also seen in DFS and the rate of distant \nmetastasis. In the STAMPEDE trial, the addition of docetaxel to EBRT and \nADT improved FFS  in the non- metastatic group (HR, 0.60 ; 95% CI, 0.45–\n0.80; P < .01).422 OS analysis did not show a significant difference, but was \nlimited in power. Based on these data, the panel recommends the addition \nof docetaxel added to EBRT and 2 years of ADT as an option for patients \nwith very -high- risk prostate cancer.  The Panel recommends the addition of \ndocetaxel to ADT plus EBRT as an option for patients with very -high-risk \nprostate cancer, but does not recommend it for patients with high-risk \nprostate cancer at this time.  \nThe Panel recommends the addition of abiraterone to ADT plus EBRT as \nan option for patients with very -high- risk prostate cancer  (fine-particle \nabiraterone can also be used, category 2B). This recommendation is \nbased on data from the STAMPEDE trial. In STAMPEDE, the HRs for FFS \nin patients with non -metastatic disease treated with EBRT/ADT plus \nabiraterone compared with EBRT/ADT was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.15– 0.31).423  \nA head- to-head comparison of ADT with either abiraterone or docetaxel in \nthis setting and in patients with metastatic disease showed no difference in \nsafety or in efficacy endpoints including OS.424 \nEBRT for Node -Positive Disease  \nEBRT with neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant  ADT is the preferred \noption for patients with clinical N1 disease. Abiraterone can be added. In \naddition, ADT alone or with abiraterone are options. In each case, the use \nof the fine -particle formulation of abiraterone  is a category 2B  \nrecommendation.  For adjuvant therapy for node- positive disease after radical prostatectomy, \nsee Adjuvant Therapy for pN1, below. \nEBRT to the Primary Tumor in Low -Volume M1 Disease  \nPatients with newly diagnosed, low- volume metastatic prostate cancer can \nbe considered for ADT with EBRT to the primary tumor based on results from the randomized controlled phase 3 STAMPEDE trial.\n333 In this \nmulticenter, international study, 2061 patients were randomized to lifelong \nADT with or without EBRT to the primary tumor (either 55 Gy in 20 daily \nfractions over 4 weeks  or 36 Gy in 6 weekly  fractions over 6 weeks). The \nprimary outcome of OS by intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis was not met \n(HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0 .80–1.06; P = .266), but EBRT improved the \nsecondary outcome of FFS (HR, 0. 76; 95% CI , 0.68–0.84; P < .0001) . In a \npre-planned subset analysis, outcomes of patients with high metastatic \nburden (defined as visceral metastases; ≥4 bone metastases with ≥1 \noutside the vertebral bodies or pelvis; or both) and those with low \nmetastatic burden (all others) were determined. EBRT improved OS \n(adjusted HR, 0. 68; 95% CI, 0. 52–0.90), prostate cancer -specific survival \n(adjusted HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47 –0.90), FFS (adjusted HR, 0. 59; 95%  CI, \n0.49–0. 72), and PFS (adjusted HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0 .63–0.98) in patients \nwith low metastatic burden, but not in patients with high metastatic burden. Randomized clinical trials are ongoing to better test the value of removal \nor radiation of the primary tumor in patients with low metastatic burden \nwho are beginning ADT.\n425-429 \nThe Panel recommends against EBRT to the primary tumor in the case of \nhigh- volume M1 disease based on the HORRAD and STAMPEDE \ntrials.333,430 No improvement in OS was seen from the addition of EBRT to \nthe primary when combined with standard systemic therapy  in patients \nwith high -volume M1 disease in either trial.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-29 Stereotactic Body Radiation T herapy  \nThe relatively slow proliferation rate of prostate cancer is reflected in a low \nα/β ratio,431 most commonly reported between 1 and 4. These values are \nsimilar to that for the rectal mucosa. Because  the α/β ratio for prostate \ncancer is similar to or lower than the surrounding tissues responsible for \nmost of the toxicity reported with  radiation, appropriately  designed \nradiation treatment fields and schedules using extremely hypofractionated regimens should result in similar cancer control rates without increased \nrisk of late toxicity.  \nSBRT is a technique that delivers highly conformal, high- dose radiation in \nfive or fewer treatment fractions, which are safe to administer only with \nprecise, image- guided delivery.\n432 Single -institution series with median \nfollow- up as long as 6 years report excellent biochemical PFS and similar \nearly toxicity (bladder, rectal, and QOL ) compared to standard radiation \ntechniques.431- 437 According to a pooled analysis of phase 2  trials, the 5 -\nyear biochemical relapse -free survival is 95%, 84%, and 81% for patients \nwith low-, intermediate- , and high- risk disease, respectively.438 A study of \nindividual patient data from a cohort of 2142 patients with low - or \nintermediate- risk prostate cancer from  10 single- institution phase 2 trials \nand 2 multi -institutional phase 2 trials  found that the 7- year cumulative \nrates of biochemical recurrence were 4.5% , 8.6% , and 14.9%  for low -risk \ndisease, favorable intermediate- risk disease, and unfavo rable \nintermediate- risk disease, respectively.439 Severe acute toxicity was rare, \nat 0.6% for grade 3 or higher genitourinary toxic events  and 0.09% for \ngrade 3 or higher gastrointestinal toxic events . Late ( 7-year cumulative \nincidence) toxicity rates were 2.4% and 0.4% for grade 3 or higher \ngenitourinary toxic events and gastrointestinal toxic events , respectively.  \nSBRT may be associated with more toxicity than moderately fractionated \nIMRT. One retrospective study of 4005 patients reported higher \ngenitourinary toxicity at 24 months after SBRT than IMRT (44% vs. 36%; P  = .001).440 Another phase 2 trial found increased toxicity with doses > 47.5 \nGy delivered  in 5 fractions .441 An analysis using the SEER database also \nreported that SBRT was more toxic than IMRT.442 Overall, prospective \nevidence supports the use of SBRT in the setting of localized prostate \ncancer.443 \nSeveral phase 3 trials have been initiated comparing conventional regimens to SBRT.\n444- 446 Preliminary results show that the genitourinary \nand bowel toxicit y is similar with the two techniques. In addition, the \nHYPO -RT-PC trial demonstrated non -inferiority of 42. 7 Gy in seven \nfractions t o 78.0 Gy in 39 fractions with respect to FFS  in patients with \nintermediate- to-high- risk prostate cancer.446 \nSBRT /extremely hypofractionated IG-IMRT regimens (6.5 Gy per fraction \nor greater) can be considered as an alternative to conventionally \nfractionated regimens at clinics with appropriate technology, physics, and \nclinical expertise. Longer follow -up and prospective multi -institutional data \nare required to evaluate longer -term results, especially because late \ntoxicity theoretically could be worse in hypofractionated regimens \ncompared to conventional fractionation (1.8– 2.0 Gy per fraction).  \nBrachytherapy   \nBrachytherapy involves placing radioactive sources into the prostate \ntissue. Brachytherapy has been used traditionally for low -risk cases \nbecause earlier studies found it less effective than EBRT for high- risk \ndisease.94,447 However, increasing evidence suggests that technical \nadvancements in brachytherapy may provide a role for contemporary brachytherapy in high- risk localized and locally advanced prostate \ncancer.\n448,449 \nThe advantage of brachytherapy is that the treatment is completed in 1 \nday with little time lost from normal activities.

The risk of incontinence is greater after TURP because of \nacute retention and bladder neck contractures, and many patients develop \nprogressive erectile dysfunction over several years. IMRT causes less \nacute and late genitourinary toxicity and similar freedom from biochemical \nrecurrence compared with iodine- 125 or palladium -103 permanent seed \nimplants.451,452 Current brachytherapy  techniques attempt to improve the \nradioactive seed placement and radiation dose distribution.  \nThere are currently two methods for prostate brachytherapy: low dose- rate \n(LDR) and high dose -rate (HDR). LDR brachytherapy consists of \nplacement of permanent seed implants in the prostate. The short range of \nthe radiation emitted from these low -energy sources allows delivery of  \nadequate dose levels to the cancer within the prostate, with  excessive \nirradiation of the bladder and rectum avoided. Post -implant dosimetry \nshould be performed to document the quality of an LDR  implant.453 HDR \nbrachytherapy, which involves temporary insertion of a radiation source, is \na newer approach.  \nTwo groups have observed a lower risk of urinary frequency, urgency, and \nrectal pain with HDR brachytherapy compared with LDR brachytherapy \n(permanent seed implant).454,455 Vargas and colleagues456 reported that \nHDR brachytherapy results in a lower risk of erectile dysfunction than LDR \nbrachytherapy. Commonly prescribed doses for LDR and HDR \nbrachytherapy are listed in the guidelines.  \nFor patients with very large or very small prostates, symptoms of bladder \noutlet obstruction (high International Prostate Symptom Score), or a previous TURP, seed implantation may be more difficult . These patients \nalso have an increased risk of side effects.  Neoadjuvant ADT may be used \nto shrink the prostate to an acceptable size;  however, increased toxicity is \nexpected from ADT, and prostate size may not decline in some patients . \nThe potential  toxicity of ADT must be weighed against the possible benefit \nof target reduction.  \nIdeally, the accuracy of brachytherapy treatment should be verified by daily prostate localization with techniques of IGRT: CT, ultrasound, \nimplanted fiducials, or electromagnetic targeting/tracking. Endorectal \nballoons may be used to improve prostate immobilization. Perirectal \nspacer materials (discussed under External Beam Radiation Therapy , \nabove) may be employed when the previously mentioned techniques are insufficient to improve oncologic cure rates and/or reduce side effects due \nto anatomic geometry o r other patient -related factors (eg, medication \nusage, comorbid conditions). Patients with obvious rectal invasion or visible T3 and posterior extension should not undergo perirectal spacer \nimplantation.  \nBrachytherapy Alone for Localized Disease \nBrachytherapy alone is an option for patients with very low, low, or favorable intermediate- risk prostate cancer, depending on life expectancy. \nPatients with high- risk cancers are generally considered poor candidates \nfor brachytherapy alone.  Either LDR or HDR brachytherapy can be used in \nthis setting.  \nRetrospective analyses show that LDR or HDR brachytherapy alone can \nbe effective and well tolerated in this population.\n457-461 A phase 2 trial in \n300 patients with intermediate- risk prostate cancer also found LDR \nbrachytherapy alone to be safe and effective.462 However, randomized \ncontrolled trials comparing brachytherapy to radical prostatectomy  or \nEBRT in this population are limited.

The 2 -year biochemical FFS \nrates were similar between the groups at 96.1% after brachytherapy and \n97.4% after radical prostatectomy ( P = .35).463 At 6-month follow -up, \ncontinence was better in the brachytherapy group whereas potency was \nbetter in the radical prostatectomy group.  \nBrachytherapy Boost  \nLDR or HDR brachytherapy can be added as a boost to EBRT plus ADT in \npatients  with unfavorable intermediate -, high- , or very -high- risk prostate \ncancer  being treated with curative intent. Combining EBRT and \nbrachytherapy allows dose escalation while minimizing acute or late \ntoxicity  in patients with high- risk localized or locally advanced cancer.464- 467 \nThis combination has demonstrated  improved biochemical control over \nEBRT plus ADT alone in randomized trials, but with higher toxicity .468- 470 An \nanalysis  of a cohort of 12,745 patients with high- risk disease found that \ntreatment with brachytherapy  (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49– 0.86)  or \nbrachytherapy plus EBRT (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66– 0.90) lowered disease -\nspecific mortality compared to EBRT alone.471 \nThe randomized ASCENDE -RT trial compar ed two methods of dose \nescalation in 398 patients  with intermediate-  or high- risk prostate cancer : \ndose- escalated EBRT boost to 78 Gy  or LDR  brachytherapy  boost .472 All \npatients  were initially treated with 12 months of ADT and pelvic EBRT to \n46 Gy . An ITT  analysis  found that the primary endpoint of biochemical \nPFS was 89% versus 84% at 5  years; 86% versus 75% at  7 years; and \n83% versus 62% at 9 years for the LDR  versus EBRT boost arms (log-\nrank P < .001). Toxicity  was higher in the brachytherapy arm, with the \ncumulative incidence of grade 3 genitourinary  events at 5 years of 18.4% \nfor brachytherapy boost and 5.2% for EBRT boost (P < .001) .473 A trend for \nincreased gastrointestinal toxicity with brachytherapy boost was also seen \n(cumulative incidence of grade 3 events at  5 years , 8.1% vs. 3.2%; P = \n.12). However, at 6- year follow -up, health -related QOL was similar between the groups in most domains, except that physical and urinary \nfunction scales were significantly lower in the LDR arm.474 Whereas the \ntoxicity is increased with the use of brachytherapy boost, this and other \nrandomized controlled trials have not shown  an improvement in OS or \ncancer -specific survival.475 \nAddition of ADT (2 or 3 years) to brachytherapy and EBRT is common for patients at high risk of recurrence. The outcome of trimodality treatment is \nexcellent, with 9 -year PFS and disease- specific survival reaching 87% and \n91%, respectively.\n476,477 However, it remains unclear whether the ADT \ncomponent contributes to outcome improvement. D’Amico and colleagues \nstudied a cohort of 1342 patients with PSA over 20 ng/mL and clinical \nT3/T4 and/or Gleason score 8 to 10 disease.478 Addition of either EBRT or \nADT to brachytherapy did not confer an advantage over brachytherapy \nalone.  The use of all three modalities reduced prostate cancer -specific \nmortality compared to brachytherapy alone (adjusted HR, 0.32; 95% CI, \n0.14– 0.73).  Other analyses did not find an improvement in recurrence rate \nwhen ADT was added to brachytherapy and EBRT.479,480 \nA large, multicenter, retrospective cohort analysis that included 1809 \npatients  with Gleason score 9– 10 prostate cancer found that multimodality \ntherapy with EBRT, brachytherapy, and ADT was associated with improved prostate cancer -specific mortality and longer time to distant \nmetastasis than either radical prostatectomy  or EBRT with ADT.\n481 In \naddition, an analysis of outcomes of almost 43,000 patients  with high -risk \nprostate cancer in the National Cancer Datab ase found that mortality was \nsimilar in patients  treated with EBRT, brachytherapy, and ADT versus \nthose treated with radical prostatectomy , but was worse in those treated \nwith EBRT and ADT.482 \nTo address historical trial data concerns  for increased toxicity incidence \nassociated with brachytherapy boost , careful patient selection and \ncontemporary planning associated with lesser toxicity, such as  use of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

In a retrospective study of 24 patients  who had EBRT as \nprimary therapy and permanent brachytherapy after biochemical \nrecurrence, the cancer -free and biochemical  relapse- free survival rates \nwere 96% and 88%, respectively, after a median follow -up of 30 months.483 \nResults of a phase 2 study of post -recurrence HDR brachytherapy after \nEBRT included relapse- free survival , distant metastases -free survival , and \ncause- specific survival rates of 68.5%, 81.5%, and 90.3%, respectively , at \n5 years.484 Toxicities were mostly grade 1 and 2 and included \ngastrointestinal toxicity  and urethral strictures, and one case of Grade 3 \nurinary incontinence. In another prospective phase 2 trial, t he primary \nendpoint of grade ≥3 late treatment -related gastrointestinal and \ngenitourinary adverse events at 9  to 24 months  after post-recurrence  \nbrachytherapy  was below the unacceptable threshold, at 14%.485 \nData on the use of brachytherapy after permanent brachytherapy are limited, but the panel agrees that it can be considered for carefully \nselected patients. Decisions regarding the use of brachytherapy in the \nrecurrent -disease setting should consider comorbidities, extent of disease, \nand potential complications. Brachytherapy in this setting is best \nperformed at high- volume centers.  \nProton Therapy  \nProton bea m RT has been used to treat patients with cancer since the \n1950s.  Proponents of proton therapy argue that this form of RT could have \nadvantages over x -ray (photon) -based radiation in certain clinical \ncircumstances. Proton therapy and x -ray–based therapies like IMRT can deliver highly conformal doses to the prostate. Proton- based therapies will \ndeliver less radiation dose to some of the surrounding normal tissues like \nmuscle, bone, vessels, and fat not immediately adjacent to the prostate. \nThese ti ssues do not routinely contribute to the morbidity of prostate \nradiation and are relatively resilient to radiation injury; therefore, the benefit of decreased dose to these types of normal, non- critical tissues \nhas not been apparent. The critical normal st ructures adjacent to the \nprostate that can create prostate cancer treatment morbidity include the \nbladder, rectum, neurovascular bundles, and occasionally small bowel.  \nThe weight of the current evidence about prostate cancer treatment \nmorbidity supports the notion that the volume of the rectum and bladder \nthat receives radiobiologically high doses of radiation near the prescription \nradiation dose accounts for the likelihood of long -term treatment morbidity, \nas opposed to higher volume, lower dose exposures. Numerous dosimetric studies have been performed trying to compare x -ray–based \nIMRT plans to proton therapy plans to illustrate how one or the other type of treatment c an be used to spare the bladder or rectum from higher dose \nparts of the exposure. These studies suffer from the biases and talents of \nthe investigators who plan and create computer models of dose deposition \nfor one therapy or the other.\n486 Although dosimetric studies in -silico can \nsuggest that the right treatment planning can make an IMRT plan beat a \nproton therapy plan and vice versa, they do not accurately predict clinically \nmeaningful endpoints.  \nComparative effectiveness studies have been published in an attempt to \ncompare toxicity and oncologic outcomes between proton and photon \ntherapies. Two comparisons between patients  treated with proton therapy \nor EBRT report similar early toxicity rates.487,488 A prospective QOL \ncomparison of patient -reported outcomes using the EPIC instrument \nbetween IMRT (204 patients) and proton therapy (1234 patients) \nconcluded that “ No differences were observed in summary score changes PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

In contrast, a single- center report of prospectively \ncollected QOL data revealed significant problems with incontinence, bowel dysfunction, and impotence at 3 months, 12 months, and greater than 2 \nyears after treatment with proton therapy.\n487 In that report, only 28% of \npatients  with normal erectile function maintained it after therapy. The \nlargest retrospective comparative effectiveness analysis to date comparing \nIMRT to proton therapy was performed using SEER -Medicare claims data \nfor the following long- term endpoints: gastrointestinal morbidity, urinary \nincontinence, non -incontinence urinary morbidity, sexual dysfunction, and \nhip fractures .490 With follow- up as mature as 80 months and using both \npropensity scoring and instrumental variable analysis, the authors \nconcluded that patients  receiving IMRT therapy had statistically \nsignificantly lower gastrointestinal morbidity than patients receiving proton therapy, whereas rates of urinary incontinence, non- incontinence urinary \nmorbidity, sexual dysfunction, hip fractures , and additional cancer \ntherapies were statistically indistinguishable between the cohorts. \nHowever, firm conclusions regarding dif ferences in toxicity or effectiveness \nof proton and photon therapy cannot be drawn because of the limitations inherent in retrospective/observational studies.  \nThe costs associated with proton beam facility construction and proton \nbeam treatment are high compared to the expense of building and using \nthe more common photon linear accelerator -based practice.\n488 The \nAmerican Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)  evaluated proton \ntherapy and created a model policy to support the society’s position on \npayment coverage for proton beam therapy in 2014.491 This model policy was updated in 2017 and recommends coverage of proton therapy for the treatment of non -metastatic prostate cancer  if the patient is enrolled in \neither an institutional review board ( IRB)-approved study or a multi -\ninstitutional registry that adher es to Medicare requirements for Coverage \nwith Evidence Development (CED) . The policy states: “ In the treatment of \nprostate cancer, the use of [proton beam therapy]  is evolving as the \ncomparative efficacy evidence is still being developed. In order for an \ninformed consensus on the role of [proton beam therapy]  for prostate \ncancer to be reached, it is essential to collect further data, especially to \nunderstand how the effectiveness of proton therapy compares to other RT  \nmodalities such as IMRT and brachytherapy. There is a need for more \nwell-designed registries and studies with sizable comparator cohorts to \nhelp accelerate data collection. Proton beam therapy for primary treatment \nof prostate cancer should only be perfor med within the context of a \nprospect ive clinical trial or registry .” \nA prospective phase 2 clinical trial enrolled 184 patients with low - or \nintermediate- risk prostate cancer who received 70 Gy  of hypofractionated \nproton therapy in 28 fractions .\n492 The 4- year rate of biochemical -clinical \nFFS was 93.5% (95% CI, 89% –98%) . Grade ≥2 acute GI and urologic \ntoxicity rates were 3.8% and 12.5%, respectively . Late  GI and urologic \ntoxicity rates were  7.6% and 13.6%, respectively , at 4 years.  \nThe NCCN Panel believes no clear evidence supports a benefit or \ndecrement to proton therapy over IMRT for either treatment efficacy or \nlong- term toxicity. Conventionally fractionated prostate proton therapy can \nbe considered a reasonable alternative to x -ray–based regimens at clinics \nwith appropriate technology, physics, and clinical expertise.  \nRadiation for Distant Metastases  \nEBRT  is an effective means of palliating isolated bone metastas es from \nprostate cancer.

A short course of 8 Gy x 1 is as \neffective as, and less costly than, 30 Gy in 10 fractions .493 In a randomized \ntrial of 898 patients with bone metastases, grade 2– 4 acute toxicity was \nobserved less often in the 8- Gy arm (10%) than in the 30- Gy arm (17%) ( P \n= .002); however, the retreatment rate was higher in the 8- Gy group (18%) \nthan in the 30 -Gy group (9%) ( P < .001).494 In another study of 425 \npatients with painful bone metastases, a single dose of 8 Gy was non -\ninferior to 20 Gy in multiple fractions in terms of overall pain response to \ntreatment.495 The SCORAD  randomized trial did not  show non- inferiority \nfor ambulatory status of single -fraction 8- Gy EBRT to 20 Gy in 5 \nfractions.496  \nThe Panel notes that 8 Gy as a single dose is as effective for pain \npalliation at any bony site as longer courses of radiation, but re -treatment \nrates are higher. Other regimens (ie, 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 37.5 Gy in 15 \nfractions) may be used as alternative palliative dosing depending on \nclinical scenario (both category 2B).  \nRadiation to metastases has also been studied in the oligometastatic \nsetting. The ORIOLE phase 2 randomized trial randomized 54 patients \nwith recurrent castration- naïve prostate cancer and 1 to 3 metastases to \nreceive SABR or observation at a 2:1 ratio .497 The primary outcome \nmeasure was progression at 6 months by increasing PSA , progression \ndetected by conventional imaging, symptomatic progression, initiation of ADT for any reason, or death.  Progression at 6 months was lower in \npatients in the SABR arm than in the observation arm ( 19% vs. 61%; P = \n.005).  The secondary endpoint of PFS was also improved in the patients \nwho received SABR (not reached vs. 5.8 months; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11–0.81; P = .002).

After a m edian follow -\nup of 51 months , the 5-year OS rate was higher in the SABR group \n(17.7% vs. 42.3%; stratified log- rank P = .006) , as was the 5 -year PFS \nrate (3.2 % vs . 17.3%; P = .001). No differences were seen in adverse \nevents  or QOL . \nThe Panel believes that SBRT to metastases can be considered in the \nfollowing circumstances:  \n• In patient s with limited metastatic disease to the vertebra or  \nparavertebral region when ablation is the goal (eg, concern for \nimpending fracture or tumor encroachment on spinal nerves or \nvertebra) . \n• In patients with oligometastatic progression where PFS is the goal.  \n• In symptomatic patients where the lesion occurs in or immediately \nadjacent to a previously irradiated treatment field.  \nComparison of Treatment Options for Localized Disease  \nSeveral large prospective, population/cohort -based studies  have \ncompared the outcomes of patients with localized prostate cancer treated \nwith EBRT, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, observation, and/or \nactive surveillance. Barocas et al compared radical prostatectomy, EBRT, \nand active surveillance in 2550 patients  and found that, after 3 years , \nradical prostatectomy was associated with a greater decrease in urinary  \nand sexual function than either EBRT or active surveillance.499 Active \nsurveillance, however, was associated with an increase in urinary irritative \nsymptoms .

By 2 years, however, differences among the groups \ncompared with active surveillance were insignificant. Results of a \nsystematic review showed similar findings to these studies.501 \nAnother study examined patient -reported outcomes in greater than 2000 \npatients with localized prostate cancer managed by radical prostatectomy, \nbrachytherapy , EBRT with or without ADT, or a ctive surveillance.502 By 5 \nyears, most functional differences were minimal between management approaches. However, radical prostatectomy was associated with worse \nincontinence in the full cohort and with worse sexual function  in those with \nunfavorable intermediate -, high- , or very -high- risk disease than those \ntreated with EBRT and ADT.  \nOther Local Therapies \nMany therapies have been investigated for the treatment of localized \nprostate cancer in the initial disease and recurrent settings, with the goals \nof reducing side effects and matching the cancer control of other \ntherapies. Cryotherapy or other local therapies are not recommended as \nroutine primary therapy for localized prostate cancer due to lack of long -\nterm data comparing these treatments to radiation or radical \nprostatectomy. At this time, the panel recommends only cryosurgery and \nhigh- intensity focused  ultrasound (HIFU; category 2B) as local therapy \noptions for RT recurrence in the absence of metastatic disease.  \nCryosurgery, also known as cryotherapy or cryoablation, is an evolving \nminimally invasive therapy that damages tumor tissue through local \nfreezing. In the initial disease setting, the reported 5- year biochemical \ndisease- free rate after cryotherapy ranged f rom 65% to 92% in patients \nwith low- risk disease using different definitions of biochemical \nrecurrence.503 A report suggests that cryotherapy and radical prostatectomy give similar oncologic results for unilateral prostate cancer.\n504 A study by Donnelly and colleagues505 randomly assigned 244 \npatients  with T2 or T3 disease to either cryotherapy or EBRT. All patients \nreceived neoadjuvant ADT. There was no difference in 3- year OS or DFS. \nPatients who received cryotherapy reported poorer sexual function.506 For \npatients with locally advanced cancer, cryoablation was associated with \nlower 8 -year biochemical progression- free rate compared to EBRT in a \nsmall trial of 62 patients, although disease- specific survival and OS were \nsimilar.507 \nCryosurgery has been assessed in patients with recurrent disease after \nRT.508- 510 In one registry -based study of 91 patients, the biochemical DFS \nrates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 95.3%, 72.4%, and 46.5%, respectively. \nAdverse events included urinary retention  (6.6%), incontinence (5.5%), \nand r ectourethral fistula (3.3%).510 \nHIFU has been studied for treatment of initial disease.511,512 A prospective \nmulti- institutional study used HIFU in 111 patients with localized prostate \ncancer.511 The radical treatment -free survival rate was 89% at 2 years, and \ncontinence and erectile functions were preserved in 97% and 78%  of \npatients, respectively, at 12 months . Morbidity was acceptable, with a \ngrade III complication rate of 13%.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-36 Analysis of a separate prospective registry showed that 48% of those  who \nreceived HIFU following radiotherapy recurrence were able to avoid ADT \nat a median follow -up of 64 months .524 \nOther emerging local therapies, such as focal laser ablation and vascular -\ntargeted photodynamic (VTP)  therapy have also been studied.525,526 The \nmulticente r, open- label, phase 3, randomi zed controlled CLIN1001 \nPCM301 trial  compared VTP therapy  (IV padeliporfin, optical fib ers \ninserted into the prostate , and subsequent laser activation) to active \nsurveillance in 413 patients  with low- risk prostate cancer.527 After a median \nfollow- up of 24 months, 28% of participants  in the VTP arm  had disease \nprogression compared with 58%  in the active surveillance arm  (adjusted \nHR, 0.34;  95% CI , 0.24–0.46; P < .0001). Negative prostate biopsy results \nwere more prevalent in the VTP group (49%  vs. 14%; adjusted RR, 3.67; \n95% CI , 2.53–5.33; P < .0001) . The most common serious adverse event \nin the VTP  group was urinary retention ( 3 of 206 patients) , which resolved \nwithin 2 months in all cases.  \nDisease Monitoring  \nPlease refer to the NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship (available at \nwww.NCCN.org ) for recommendations regarding common consequences \nof cancer and cancer treatment  (eg, cardiovascular disease risk \nassessment; a nxiety, depression, trauma, and d istress ; hormone- related \nsymptoms; sexual dysfunction) and on the promot ion of physical activity, \nweight management, and proper immunizations in survivors . \nPatients After Initial Definitive Therapy  \nFor patients initially treated with intent to cure, serum PSA levels should \nbe measured every 6 to 12 months for the first 5 years and then annually. \nPSA testing every 3 months may be better for patients  at high risk of \nrecurrence. When prostate cancer recurred after radical prostatectomy, Pound and colleagues found that 45% of patients experienced recurrence within the first 2 years, 77% within the first 5 years, and 96% by 10 \nyears.\n528 Local recurrence may result in substantial morbidity and can, in \nrare cases, occur in the absence of a PSA elevation. Therefore, annual \nDRE is appropriate to monitor for prostate cancer recurrence and to detect \ncolorectal cancer. Similarly, after RT, the monitoring of serum PSA levels \nis recommended every 6 months for the first 5 years and then annually \nand a DRE is recommended annually. The clinician may opt to omit the \nDRE if PSA levels remain undetectable.  \nPatients with Castration -Naïve Disease  on ADT  \nThe intensity of clinical monitoring f or patients on ADT for castration- naïve \ndisease is determined by the response to initial ADT, EBRT , or both. \nFollow -up evaluation of these patients should include history and physical \nexamination and PSA measurement  every 3 to 6 months based on clinical \njudgment. Imaging can be considered periodically to monitor treatment \nresponse. The relative risk for bone metastasis or death increases as \nPSADT falls;  a major inflection point  appears  at PSADT of 8 months. Bone \nimaging should be performed more frequently in these patients .529  \nPatients with Localized Disease  Under Observation  \nPatients with localized disease on observation follow the same monitoring \nrecommendations as patients with castration- naïve disease who are on \nADT, except that the physical exam and PSA measurement should only be done every 6 months.  \nWorkup for Progression  \nCastrate levels of testosterone should be documented if clinically indicated in patients with signs of progression, with adjustment of ADT as \nnecessary. If serum testosterone levels are <50 ng/dL, the patient should undergo disease workup with bone and soft tissue imaging (see Imaging \nTechniques above for more details ):  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-37 • Bone imaging can be achieved by conventional technetium -99m-\nMDP bone scan.  \no Plain films, CT, MRI, or PET/CT or PET/MRI with F -18 \nsodium fluoride, C -11 choline, F- 18 fluciclovine, Ga- 68 \nPSMA- 11, or F- 18 PyL PSMA can be considered for \nequivocal results on initial bone imaging.  \n• Soft tissue imaging of pelvis, abdomen, and chest can include \nchest CT and abdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI.  \n• Alternatively, Ga -68 PSMA -11 or F- 18 PyL PSMA PET/CT or \nPET/MRI can be considered for bone and soft tissue (full body) \nimaging.  \no Because of the increased sensitivity and specificity of PSMA- PET tracers for detecting micrometastatic disease \ncompared to conventional imaging (CT, MRI) at both initial staging and biochemical recurrence, the Panel does not \nfeel that conventional imaging is a necessary prerequisite \nto PSMA -PET and that PSMA -PET/CT or PSMA- PET/MRI \ncan serve as an equally effective, if not more effective front -\nline imaging tool for these patients.  \nASCO has published guidelines on the optimal imaging strategies for \npatients with advanced prostate cancer.\n530 ASCO recommendations are \ngenerally consistent with those provided here.  \nPost -Radical Prostatectomy Treatment  \nMost p atients who have undergone radical prostatectomy  are cured of \nprostate cancer. However, some patients  will have adverse pathologic \nfeatures, positive lymph nodes, or biochemical persistence or recurrence. \nSome patients  have detectable PSA after radical prostatectomy due to \nbenign prostate tissue in the prostate fossa. They have low stable PSAs \nand a very low risk of prostate cancer progression.531,532 Serial PSA measurements can be helpful for  stratifying patients  at highest risk of \nprogression and metastases.  \nSelecting patients  appropriately for adjuvant radiation is difficult.  \nAdjuvant/Early Treatment  for Adverse Features  \nAdjuvant radiation with or without ADT can be given to patients  with PSA \npersistence (PSA does not  fall to undetectable levels) or adverse \npathologic features  (ie, positive margins, seminal vesicle invasion, \nextracapsular extension) who do not have lymph node metastases.  \nPositive  surgical margins are unfavorable, especially  if diffuse (>10 -mm \nmargin involvement or ≥3 sites of positivity) or associated with persistent \nserum levels of PSA.  The defined target volumes include the prostate \nbed.533 Monitoring after radical prostatectomy  is also appropriate, with \nconsideration of early EB RT for a detectable and rising PSA or PSA >0.1 \nng/mL .  \nDecision s about when to initiate post -radical prostatectomy radiation and \nwhether to include ADT are complex. The Panel recommends use of \nnomograms and consideration of age  and comorbidities, clinical and \npathologic information, PSA levels,  PSADT, and Decipher molecular \nassay to individualize treatment  discussion.  Older trials conducted by \nSWOG and EORTC showed that post -prostatectomy adjuvant radiation \nimproved biochemical PFS in patients with extraprostatic disease at \nradical prostatectomy.534- 536 More recent randomized trials  that used \nmodern surgical and radiation techniques  provide high- level evidence that \ncan be used to counsel patients and are discussed herein.  \nIn the RADICALS -RT trial, 1396 patients with adverse features after \nradical prostatectomy were followed for a median 4.9 years and no \ndifferences were seen in 5- year biochemical PFS and f reedom from non -\nprotocol hormone therapy .537 However, urinary incontinence and grade 3–\n4 urethral strictures were more frequent in the adjuvant therapy group.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-38 GETUG -AFU 17 trial and the TROG 08.03/ANZUP RAVES trial were both \nterminated early for unexpectedly low event rates , but similarly found no \nevidence of oncologic benefit with increased risk of genitourinary toxicity \nand erectile dysfunction when adjuvant therapy was used.538,539 Another \nrandomized trial, however, saw an improvement in 10- year survival for \nbiochemical recurrence with the use of adjuvant therapy ( HR, 0.26; 95% \nCI, 0.14 –0.48; P < .001) .540 \nSystematic reviews come to conflicting conclusions on the utility of \nimmediate post-prostatectomy radiation in patients with adverse \nfeatures.541,542 A retrospective cohort analysis of more than 26,000 patients \nconcluded that patients with adverse features after radical prostatectomy \n(ie, Gleason 8– 10; pT3/4; pN1) should be candidates for adjuvant \nradiation because a reduction in all- cause mortality  was observed in such \npatients.543 \nA limited amount of data inform the decision regarding the addition of ADT \nto EBRT in this setting. The ongoing SPPORT trial (NCT00567580) of \npatients with PSA  levels between 0.1 and 2.0 ng/mL at least 6 weeks after \nradical prostatectomy  has reported preliminary results on clinicaltrials.gov . \nThe primary  outcome measure of percentage of participants free from  \nprogression (FFP) at 5 years was 70.3 (95% CI, 66.2– 74.3) for  those  who \nreceived EBRT to the prostate bed and 81.3 (95% CI,  77.9–84.6) for those \nwho received EBRT with 4  to 6 months of ADT ( luteinizing hormone -\nreleasing hormone [ LHRH]  agonist plus antiandrogen).  Results of a \nretrospective analysis of radical prostatectomy  specimens from patients in \nRTOG 9601 suggest that those with low PSA and a low Decipher score \nderived less benefit (development of distant metastases, OS) from bicalutamide than those with a high Decipher score.\n544 Patients with high \nDecipher genomic classifier scores  (GC >0.6) should be strongly \nconsidered for EBRT and addition of  ADT when the opportunity for early \nEBRT has been missed.  Overall, the Panel believes that adjuvant or early EBRT after recuperation \nfrom operation may be beneficial in patients  with one or more adverse \nlaboratory or pathologic features, which include positive surgical margin, \nseminal vesicle invasion, and/or extracapsular extension as noted in the \nguideline by the American Urological Association (AUA) and ASTRO.545 \nThe value of whole pelvic irradiation  in this setting  is unclear due to a lack \nof benefit in PFS in two trials (RTOG 9413 and GETUG 01)416,417,546,547; \nwhole pelvic radiation may be appropriate for selected patients.   \nAdjuvant Therapy for pN1 \nAdjuvant therapy can also be given to patients  with positive lymph nodes \nfound during or after radical prostatectomy. Several management options should be considered. ADT is a category 1 option , as discussed below  \n(see Neoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for \nRegional Disease) .\n548 Retrospective data show that initial observation may \nbe safe in some patients  with N1 disease at radical prostatectomy, \nbecause 28% of a cohort of 369 patients remained free from biochemical \nrecurrence at 10 years.549 Therefore, another  option is monitoring with \nconsideration of early treatment for a detectable and rising PSA or PSA \n>0.1 ng/mL, based further on extrapolation of data from RADICALS -RT, \nGETUG -AFU 17, and TROG 08.03/ANZUP RAVES.537- 539 A third option is \nthe addition of pelvic EBRT to ADT (category 2B). This last \nrecommendation is based on retrospective studies and a National Cancer \nDatabase analysis that demonstrated  improved biochemical recurrence-\nfree survival , cancer -specific survival , and all -cause survival  with post -\nprostatectomy EBRT and ADT compared  to adjuvant ADT alone in \npatients with lymph node metastases.550- 553 \nBiochemical Recurrence After  Radical P rostatectomy \nPatients  who experience biochemical recurrence after radical \nprostatectomy fall into three  groups: 1) those whose PSA level does not  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Consensus has not defined a \nthreshold level of PSA below which PSA is truly “undetectable.”531 Group 3 \ndoes not require further evaluation until PSA increases, but the workup for \n1 and 2  must include an evaluation for distant metastases.  \nSeveral retrospective studies have assessed the prognostic value of \nvarious combinations of pretreatment PSA levels, Gleason scores, \nPSADT, and the presence or absence of positive surgical margins.554- 558 A \nlarge retrospective review of 501 patients who received radiation for \ndetectable and increasing PSA after radical prostatectomy557 showed that \nthe predictors of progression were Gleason score 8 to 10, pre- EBRT PSA \nlevel >2 ng/mL, seminal vesicle invasion, negative surgical margins , and \nPSADT ≤10 months. However, prediction of  systemic disease versus local \nrecurrence and hence responsiveness  to postoperative radiation has \nproven unfeasible for individual patients using clinical and pathologic \ncriteria.559 Delivery of adjuvant or post -recurrence  EBRT becomes both \ntherapeutic and diagnostic —PSA response indicates local \npersistence/recurrence. Delayed biochemical recurrence requires \nrestaging,  and a nomogram118,560 may prove useful to predict response , but \nit has not been validated.  \nThe utility of imaging for patients  with an early biochemical recurrence \nafter radical prostatectomy depends on disease risk before operation and \npathologic stage, Gleason grade, PSA, and PSADT after recurrence. \nPatients with low-  and intermediate -risk disease and low postoperative \nserum PS A levels have a very low risk of positive bone scans or CT \nscans.561,562 In a series of 414 bone scans performed in 230 patients  with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, the rate of a positive \nbone scan for patients  with PSA >10 ng/mL was only 4%.563  \nThe specific  staging tests depend on the clinical history, but should include \na calculation of PSADT to inform nomogram use and counseling. In \naddition, bone imaging; chest CT; abdominal/pelvic CT or \nabdominal/pelvic MRI; C -11 choline PET/CT or PET/MRI or F -18 \nfluciclovine PET/CT  or PET/MRI; and prostate bed biopsy may be useful.  \nThe Decipher molecular assay can be considered for prognostication after \nradical prostatectomy (category 2B). A meta- analysis of five studies with \n855 patients and median follow -up of 8 years found that the 10 -year \ncumulative incidence metastases rates for patients  classified as l ow, \nintermediate, and high risk by Decipher after radical prostatectomy were 5.5%, 15.0%, and 26.7%, respectively  (P < .001).\n564 \nBone imaging is appropriate when patients develop symptoms or when \nPSA level s are increasing rapidly. In one study, the probability of a positive \nbone scan for a patient not on ADT after radical prostatectomy was less \nthan 5% unless the PSA increased to 40 to 45 ng/mL.565 A prostate bed \nbiopsy may be helpful when imaging suggests local recurrence.  \nPatients with PSA recurrence (undetectable PSA that increases on two or \nmore measurements)  after radical prostatectomy  may be observed or \nundergo primary EBRT with or without ADT if distant metastases are not  \ndetected .  \nLarge retrospective cohort studies support the use of EBRT in the setting \nof biochemical recurrence, because it is associated with decreased all -\ncause mortality and increased prostate cancer -specific survival .559,566 The \nrecommended post -radical prostatectomy EBRT dose is 64 to 72 Gy and \nmay be increased for gross recurrence that has been proven by biopsy. \nThe target volume includes the prostate bed and may include the whole \npelvis in selected patients.533 Treatment is most effective when pre -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Pelvic r adiation is not \nrecommended but may be given to the site of bone metastasis if in weight -\nbearing bones or if the patient is symptomatic . Observation remains \nacceptable for selected patients , with ADT delayed until symptoms \ndevelop or PSA levels suggest that symptoms are imminent . In all cases, \nthe form of primary or secondary systemic therapy  should be based on the \nhormonal status of t he patient.  \nPost -Radiation Recurrence  \nThe 2006 Phoenix definition was revised by ASTRO and the RTOG  in \nPhoenix:  1) PSA rise by 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir PSA is the \nstandard definition for biochemical recurrence  after EBRT with or without hormonal therapy ; and 2) A recurrence evaluation should be considered \nwhen PSA has been confirmed to be increasing after radiation even if the \nrise above nadir is not yet 2 ng/mL, especially in candidates for additional \nlocal therapy who are young and healthy.572 Retaining a strict version of \nthe ASTRO definition allows comparison with a large existing body of literature. Rapid increase  of PSA may warrant evaluation (prostate biopsy) \nprior to meeting the Phoenix definition, especially in younger or healthier patients .  \nWorkup for RT recurrence typically includes PSA DT calculation, bone \nimaging, TRUS biopsy, and prostate MRI ; in addition,  a chest CT, an \nabdominal/pelvic CT or abdominal/pelvic MRI, C -11 choline PET/CT or \nPET/MRI, or F -18 fluciclovine PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered.  \nLocal radiation recurrences  are most responsive to additional  therapy \nwhen PSA le vels at the time of treatment are  low (<5 ng/mL).  Biopsy \nshould be encouraged at the time of radiation biochemical recurrence  if \nstaging workup does not reveal metastatic disease. P rostate biopsy in the \nsetting of suspected local recurrence after  radiation should be considered , \nincluding biopsy at the junction of the seminal vesicle and prostate, \nbecause this is a common site of recurrence .  \nOptions for therapy for those with positive biopsy but low suspicion of \nmetastases to distant organs  and a life expectancy greater than 10 years  \ninclude observation or radical prostatectomy  with PLND in selected cases \nby highly experienced surgeons.  Radical prostatectomy after RT \nrecurrence can result in long- term disease control, but is often associated \nwith impotence and urinary incontinence.\n573 Other options for localized \ninterventions include cryotherapy ,574 HIFU (category 2B),516- 519,523,524 and \nbrachytherapy (reviewed by Allen and colleagues575 and discussed in \nPost-Recurrence Brachytherapy , above).

Therefore, mpMRI or full -body PET imaging can be \nconsidered (see Imaging Techniques, above). In the absence of \ndetectable metastases with a negative biopsy, observation  or ADT are \noptions  for patients with PSA recurrence after radiation.  \nPatients with radiographic evidence of  distant metastases should proceed \nto ADT for castration- naïve disease.  \nAndrogen Deprivation Therapy  \nADT is administered as primary systemic therapy for  regional or advanced \ndisease and as n eoadjuvant/concomitant/adjuvant therapy  in combination \nwith radiation in localized or local ly advanced prostate cancers . \nIn the community, ADT has been commonly used as primary therapy for \nearly -stage, low -risk disease , especially in the patients who are older . This \npractice has been challenged by a large cohort study of 66,717 patients  \n≥66 years of age with T1 –T2 tumors.576 No 15 -year survival benefit was \nfound in patients receiving ADT compared to observation alone. Similarly, \nanother cohort study of 15,170 patients  diagnosed with clinically localized \nprostate cancer who were not treated with curative intent therapy reported no survival benefit from primary ADT after adjusting for demographic and \nclinical variables.\n577 Placing patients with early prostate  cancer on ADT \nshould not be routine practice.  \nAntiandrogen monotherapy  (bicalutamide)  after completion of primary \ntreatment was investigated as an adjuvant therapy in patients with \nlocalized or locally advanced prostate cancer , but results did not support \nits use in this setting.578,579 Castrate levels of serum testosterone (<50 ng/dL; < 1.7 nmol/ L) should be \nachieved with ADT, because low nadir serum testosterone levels were \nshown to be associated with improved cause -specific survival  in the PR -7 \nstudy .580 Patients who do not achieve adequate suppression of serum \ntestosterone (<50 ng/dL) with medical or surgical castration can be considered for additional hormonal manipulations (with estrogen, \nantiandrogens, LHRH antagonists, or steroids), although the clinical \nbenefit remains uncertain. Monitoring testosterone levels 12 weeks after \nfirst dose of LHRH therapy and upon increase in PSA should be \nconsidered.  \nADT for Clinically Localized (N0 ,M0) Disease  \nADT should not be used as monotherapy in clinically localized prostate cancer unless there is a contraindication to definitive local therapy, such \nas life expectancy less than 5 years and comorbidities. Under those \ncircumstances, ADT may be an acceptable alternative if the disease is \nhigh or very high risk (see Palliative ADT , below).  \nIn the clinically localized setting, ADT using an LHRH  agonist —alone or \nwith a first-generation antiandrogen—or an LHRH antagonist can be used \nas a neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant to EBRT in patients with \nunfavorable intermediate -, high- , or very -high- risk prostate cancer, as \ndescribed in more detail below.   \nADT used as neoadjuvant treatment before radical prostatectomy is \nstrongly discouraged outside of a clinical trial .  \nNeoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for \nIntermediate -Risk Disease \nThe addition of short -term ADT to radiation improved OS and cancer -\nspecific survival in three randomized trials containing 20% to 60% of \npatients  with intermediate -risk prostate cancer (Trans Tasman Radiation \nOncology Group [TROG] 9601, Dana Farber Cancer Institute [DFCI] PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

RTOG 9408 had previously \nshown that 4 months of ADT combined with EBRT improved survival in \nthose with intermediate -risk disease compared to EBRT alone.583 \nConsistent with earlier studies , RTOG 9910 demonstrated that there is no \nreason to extend ADT beyond 4 months when given in conjunction with \nEBRT in patients  with intermediate -risk disease.  \nRTOG 9902 compared long- term ADT and EBRT with and without \npaclitaxel, estramustine, and etoposide  (TEE) chemotherapy in  patients  \nwith locally advanced, high- risk prostate cancer .589 In the randomized \ncohort of 397 patients w ith a median follow -up of 9.2 years, results  \ndemonstrated no significant difference in ADT+EBRT  versus  \nADT+EBRT+ TEE in OS (65% vs. 63%; P = .81), biochemical recurrence  \n(58% vs. 54%; P = .82), distant metastases  (16% vs. 14%; P = .42), or \nDFS (22% vs. 26%; P = .61), but a substantial increase in toxicity (3.9% \nvs. 0% treatment -related deaths) , which resulted in early closure of the \ntrial.589 Thus, the fact that 6 months of ADT improved survival compared to \nEBRT alone does not mean it is better than 4 months of ADT, and the fact that systemic chemotherapy is effec tive in one setting (high- volume \nmetastatic disease or CRPC ) should not lead to the assumption that  it will \nbe beneficial in other settings (eg, high- risk localized disease) .590,591 \nAt this time, the Panel recommends 4 to 6 months of ADT when EBRT is \ngiven to patients as initial treatment of unfavorable intermediate -risk \nprostate cancer. If brachytherapy is added to EBRT in this setting, then 4 \nto 6 months of ADT is optional.  \nNeoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for High -Risk or \nVery -High -Risk Disease  \nADT combined with EBRT is an effective primary treatment for patients at \nhigh risk or very high risk,  as discussed in the Radiation Therapy  section \nabove. Combination therapy  was consistently associated with improved  \ndisease- specific survival and OS compared to single- modality treatment  in \nrandomized phase 3 studies .408,409,411,412,592 \nIncreasing evidence favors long- term over short -term \nneoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT for patients with high-  and very -\nhigh- risk disease. The RTOG 9202 trial included 1521 patients with T2c -\nT4 prostate cancer who received 4 months of ADT before and duri ng \nEBRT.593 They were randomized to no further treatment or an additional 2 \nyears of ADT. At 10 years, the long- term group was superior for all \nendpoints except OS. A subgroup analysis of patients with a Gleason score of 8 to 10 found an advantage in OS for long- term ADT at 10 years \n(32% vs. 45%, P  = .0061). At a median follow -up of 19.6 years , long- term \nADT was superior for all endpoints including OS in the entire cohort (12% \nrelative reduction;  P = .03).\n594  \nThe EORTC 22961 trial also showed superior survival when 2.5 years of \nADT were  added to EBRT given with 6 months of ADT in 970 patients, \nmost  of whom had  T2c–T3, N0 disease.595 The DART01/05 GICOR trial \nalso reported similar results in patients  with high -risk disease.596 In a PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Primary \nADT options are orchiectomy, an LHRH agonist, an LHRH agonist with a \nfirst-generation antiandrogen, or an LHRH antagonist (category 2B); or \norchiectomy, LHRH agonist, or LHRH antagonist with abiraterone. Another \noption for these patients  is EBRT with 2 to 3 years of \nneoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT (category 1, see Neoadjuvant, \nConcurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for Regional Disease, \nbelow).  For those patients with N1 disease who are treated with radiation \nto the prostate and pelvic nodes, abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) with \nADT should be considered for a total of 2 years . Abiraterone should not be \ncoadministered with an antiandrogen (see Abiraterone Acetate in \nCastration -Naïve Prostate Cancer , below).   The EORTC 30846 trial randomized 234 treatment -naïve patients with \nnode- positive prostate cancer to immediate versus delayed ADT.601 At 13 \nyears  median follow -up, the authors report ed similar survival between the \ntwo arms, although the study was not powered to show non- inferiority . \nNeoadjuvant, Concurrent, and/or Adjuvant ADT with EBRT for Regional \nDisease  \nPatients  initially diagnosed with pelvic lymph node- positive disease who \nhave a life expectancy greater than 5 years can be treated with EBRT with \n2 to 3 years of neoadjuvant/c oncurrent /adjuvant ADT (category 1) with or \nwithout abiraterone. Alternatively, they can receive primary ADT without EBRT with or without abiraterone (see Primary ADT for Lymph Node \nMetastases , above and Abiraterone Acetate in Castration- Naïve Prostate \nCancer , below). Neoadjuvant/c oncurrent /adjuvant ADT options are an \nLHRH agonist, an  LHRH agonist with a first-generation antiandrogen , or \nan LHRH antagonist. A biraterone should not be coadministered with an \nantiandrogen.  \nThe role of adjuvant ADT after radical prostatectomy  is restricted to cases \nwhere positive pelvic lymph nodes  are found,  although reports  in this area \nreveal mixed findings. Messing and colleagues  randomly assigned 98 \npatients who were found to have positive lymph nodes at the time of radical prostatectomy to immediate continuous ADT or observation.\n548 In \nthe immediate ADT arm of 47 patients, 30 remained alive, 29 of whom \nwere prostate cancer recurrence -free and 26 of whom wer e PSA \nrecurrence- free after a median follow- up of 11.9 years (range , 9.7–14.5 \nyears for survivors) .548,602 Those receiving immediate ADT also had a \nsignificant improvement in OS (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.01– 3.35).  \nHowever, these results differ from a SEER Medicare,  population- based \ntest of ADT  published subsequently .603 The SEER Medicare -based study \nof patients  who underwent radical prostatectomy and had positive lymph \nnodes used propensity matching to compare patients  who received ADT PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

The groups had similar \nmedian and range of  follow- up for survivors , but OS and prostate cancer -\nspecific survival were simi lar. The Messing study occurred prior to the \nPSA era , but the studies are similar in almost all other respects. The \nMessing study showed almost  unbelievable benefit , and the population-\nbased study of 731 patients  showed no benefit.  Furthermore, a  meta -\nanalysis resulted in a recommendation against ADT for pathologic lymph node metastatic prostat e cancer in the ASCO guidelines.\n604 In addition, a \ncohort analysis of 731 patients  with positive nodes did not  demonstrate a \nsurvival benefit of ADT initiated within 4 months of radical prostatectomy \ncompared to observation.603 At this time, the Panel recommends that \npatients with lymph node metastases found at radical prostatectomy \nshould be considered for immediate ADT (category 1) with or without \nEBRT (category 2B), but that observation is also an option for these \npatients.  \nPalliative ADT  \nPalliative ADT can be given to patients  with a life expectancy of less than \nor equal to 5 years who have high- risk, very -high- risk, regional, or \nmetastatic prostate cancer. Palliative ADT also can be given to patients \nwith disease progression during observation, usually when symptoms \ndevelop or  when changes in PSA levels suggest that symptoms are \nimminent. The options in this setting are orchiectomy , LHRH agonist , or \nLHRH antagonist (ca tegory 2B for LHRH antagonist).  \nADT for C astration- Naive Disease  \nThe term “ castration- naive\" is used to define patients who have not been \ntreated with ADT and those who are not on ADT at the time of \nprogression. The NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel uses the term  \"castration -\nnaive\" even when patients have had neoadjuvant, concurrent,  and/or \nadjuvant ADT as part of RT provided they have recovered testicular \nfunction.  Options for patients with castration- naïve disease who require ADT depend on the presence of distant metastases, and can be found in full in the Guidelines algorithm above.  \nADT for castration- naïve prostate cancer can be accomplished using \nbilateral orchiectomy , an LHRH agonist or antagonist , or an LHRH agonist \nplus a first -generation antiandrogen.  As discussed below, abiraterone or \ndocetaxel can be added to orchiectomy, LHRH agonist, or LHRH \nantagonist for M1 disease. For patients with M0 disease, observation is preferred over ADT.  \nLHRH agonists and LHRH antagonists appear equally effective in patients \nwith advanced prostate cancer.\n605  \nMedical or surgical castration combined with an antiandrogen is known as \ncombined androgen blockade. No prospective randomized studies have \ndemonstrated a survival advantage with combined androgen blockade \nover the serial use of an LHRH agonist and an antiandrogen.604 Meta -\nanalysis data suggest that bicalutamide may provide an incremental \nrelative improvement in OS by 5% to 20% over LHRH agonist \nmonotherapy.606,607 However, others have concluded that more complete \ndisruption of the androgen axis (with finasteride, dutasteride, or \nantiandrogen added to medical or surgical castration) provides little if any \nbenefit over castration alone.608,609 Combined androgen blockade therapy \nadds to  cost and side effects, and prospective randomized evidence that \ncombined androgen blockade is more efficacious than ADT is lacking.   \nAntiandrogen monotherapy appears to be less effective than medical or surgical castration and is not recommended for primary  ADT.  Furthermore, \ndutasteride plus bicalutamide showed no benefit over bicalutamide alone \nin patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.\n610 \nRecent evidence suggests that orchiectomy may be safer than an LHRH \nagonist.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-45 who underwent orchiectomy were compared to 2866 patients who \nreceived LHRH agonist between 1995  and 2009. Orchiectomy was \nassociated with lower risk of fracture, peripheral arterial disease , and \ncardiac-related complications , although risk was similar for diabetes, deep \nvein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism , and cognitive disorders .611 Post-\nhoc analysis of a randomized trial of LHRH antagonist versus LHRH agonist found lower risk of cardiac events in patients with existing cardiac \ndisease treated with LHRH antagonist.\n612 The heart and T lymphocytes \nhave receptors for LHRH.  Therefore, LHRH agonists may affect cardiac \ncontractility, vascular plaque stability , and inflammation.613 \nA new LHRH antagonist, relugolix , has  been studied as ADT in patients \nwith advanced prostate cancer in the randomized phase 3 HERO trial.614 In \nthis study, 622 patients received relugolix (120 mg orally once daily) and 308 received leuprolide (injections every 3 months)  for 48 weeks. The \npatients had recurrence after primary definitive therapy, newly diagnosed metastatic castration- naïve disease, or advanced localized disease \ndeemed unlikely to be cured with definite therapy. The primary endpoint , \nsustained castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng per deciliter) through 48 \nweeks , showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix  over leuprolide \n(96.7% ; 95% CI, 94.9– 97.9 vs. 88.8% [95% CI, 84.6– 91.8]; P < .001 for \nsuperiority ). The secondary endpoint of castrate levels of testosterone on \nday 4 was also improved in the relugolix arm (56% vs. 0%). However, \nrelugolix did not achieve superiority in the key clinical secondary endpoint of castration resistance -free survival compared to leuprolide (74% vs . \n75%; P = .84). The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was \n2.9% in the relugolix arm and 6.2% in the leuprolide arm  (HR, 0.46; 95% \nCI, 0.24 –0.88).   The Panel includes relugolix alone as an option for ADT in \npatients wit h castration -naïve disease . However, the P anel notes that data \nare limited on long- term adherence of oral relugolix and the potential \neffects  non-adherence may have on optimal ADT. Ongoing monitoring for sustained suppression of testosterone (<50 ng/dL) can be considered, and \nrelugolix may not be a preferred agent if adherence is uncertain.   \nIt is important to note that the HERO trial did not include patients receiving \ncurative intent therapy ( ie, individuals getting definitive EBRT plus  ADT). \nFurthermore, relugolix shows a shorter time to testosterone recovery, which might be associated with a higher  risk of death from prostate \ncancer.\n615 Therefore, although the P anel considers relugolix to be an \nacceptable option in the curative- intent setting, additional studies in this \nsetting are needed.  \nPatients  should  be queried about adverse effects related to ADT.  \nIntermittent ADT should be used for those  who experience significant side \neffects of ADT  (see Intermittent Versus Continuous ADT,  below) . \nADT for M0 Biochemical Recurrence  \nControversy remains about the timing and duration of ADT when disease \npersists or recurs after  local therapy. M any believe that  early ADT is best , \nbut cancer control must be balanced against side effects. E arly ADT is \nassociated with increased side effects and the potential development of the metabolic  syndrome.  \nPatients with an increasing PSA level and with no symptomatic or clinical \nevidence of cancer after definitive treatment present a therapeutic \ndilemma regarding the role of ADT. Some of these patients will ultimately \ndie of their cancer. Timing of ADT for patients whose only evidence of \ncancer is increasing PSA is influenced by PSA velocity  (PSADT) , patient \nand physician anxiety, the short -term and long- term side effects of ADT, \nand underlying comorbidities of the patient. Early ADT is acceptable, but \nan alternative is close observation until progression of cancer, at which \ntime appropriate therapeutic options  may be considered. Earlier ADT may \nbe better than delayed therapy, although the definitions of early and late (ie, what level of PSA) remain controversial.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-46 TROG 03.06/ VCOG PR 01 -03 [TOAD ] trial randomized 293 patients  with \nPSA relapse after operation or radiation (n = 261) or who were not \nconsidered for curative treatment (n = 32) to immediate ADT or ADT \ndelayed by a recommended interval of greater than or equal to 2 years .616 \nFive-year OS was improved in the immediate therapy arm compared with \nthe delayed therapy arm ( 91.2% vs. 86.4%; log -rank P = .047).  No \nsignificant differences were seen in the secondary endpoint of global \nhealth- related QOL at 2 years.617 In addition, there were no differences \nover 5 years in global QOL , physical functioning, role or emotional  \nfunctioning, insomnia, fatigue, dyspnea, or feeling less masculine.  \nHowever, sexual activity was lower and the hormone treatment -related \nsymptoms  score was higher in the immediate ADT group compared with \nthe delayed ADT group. Most clinical trials in this patient population \nrequire PSA level ≥0.5 mg/dL (after radical prostatectomy) or “nadir + 2” \n(after radiation)  for enrollment.  \nThe Panel believes that t he benefit of early ADT is  uncertain and must be \nbalanced against the risk of ADT side effects . Patients with an elevated \nPSA and/or a shorter PSADT (rapid PSA velocity) and an otherwise long \nlife expectancy should be encouraged to consider ADT earlier. Patients  \nwho opt for ADT should consider  the intermittent approach. The timing of \nADT initiation should be individualized according to PSA velocity, patient \nanxiety, and potential side effects. Patients with shorter PSADT or rapid \nPSA velocity and long life expectancy may be encouraged to consider \nearly ADT.  Patients  with prolonged PSA DTs who are older are excellent \ncandidates for observation.  \nPrimary ADT for M1 Castration -Naïve Prostate Cancer  \nADT with treatment intensification is preferred for most patients with  \nmetastatic prostate cancer. ADT alone is appropriate for some patients .604 \nA PSA value ≤4 ng/mL after 7 months of ADT is associated with improved \nsurvival of patients newly diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer.618 ADT options for M1 castration- naïve disease are:  \n• Orchiectomy ± docetaxel  \n• LHRH agonist alone ± docetaxel  \n• LHRH agonist plus first -generation antiandrogen ± docetaxel  \n• LHRH antagonist ± docetaxel  \n• Orchiectomy plus abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide  \n• LHRH agonist plus abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide  \n• LHRH antagonist plus abiraterone , apalutamide, or enzalutamide  \nIn patients with overt metastases in weight -bearing bone who are at risk of \ndeveloping symptoms associated with the flare in testosterone with initial \nLHRH agonist alone, antiandrogen therapy should precede or be \ncoadministered with LHRH agonist for at least 7 days  to diminish ligand \nbinding to the androgen receptor .619,620 LHRH antagonists rapidly and \ndirectly inhibit the release of androgens , unlike LHRH agonists that initially \nstimulate LHRH receptors  prior to hypogonadism . Therefore, no initial flare \nis associated with these agents and coadministration of antiandrogen is unnecessary.  \nThe data supporting the addition of abiraterone, apalutamide, \nenzalutamide,  or docetaxel to ADT in this setting are discussed below. \nThese are all category 1, preferred options; the fine- particle formulation of \nabiraterone (discussed in Abiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC , below ) can be \nadded to ADT as a category 2B option. ADT (LHRH agonist, LHRH antagonist, or orchiectomy) with EBRT to the primary tumor for low -\nvolume metastatic disease is discussed in EBRT to the Primary Tumor in Low-Volume M1 Disease , above.  \nAbiraterone Acetate in Castration -Naïve Prostate Cancer  \nIn February  2018, the FDA approved abiraterone in combination with \nprednisone for metastatic castration- naïve  prostate cancer .621,622 This \napproval was based on two randomized phase 3 clinical trials  of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

High-\nrisk disease was  defined as at l east two of the following:  Gleason score 8–\n10, ≥3 bone metastases, and visceral metastases.623 Efficacy was \ndemonstrated at the first interim analysis , and the trial was unblinded. The \nprimary endpoint of OS  was met and favor ed abiraterone (HR , 0.62; 95% \nCI, 0.51–0.76; P < .0001). Estimated 3 -year OS rates improv ed from 49% \nto 66% at  30 months follow -up. Secondary endpoints were improved and \nincluded delayed castration- resistant radiographic progression (from \nmedian 14.8– 33.2 months), PSA progression (7.4 –33.2 months), time to \npain progression,  and initiation of chemotherapy. After the first interim  \nanalysis, 72 patients crossed over from placebo to abiraterone.  Final OS \nanalysis of  LATITUDE after a median follow -up of 51. 8 months  showed \nmedian OS  was significantly longer in the abiraterone group than in the \nplacebo group ( 53.3 months vs. 36.5 mo nths; HR, 0.66; 95% CI , 0.56–\n0.78; P < .0001).624 \nAdverse events were higher with abiraterone and prednisone but were \ngenerally mild in nature and largely related to mineralocort icoid excess ( ie, \nhypertension, hypokalemia, edema), hormonal effects ( ie, fatigue, hot \nflushes), and liver toxicity.623 Cardiac events , such as atrial fibrillation , were \nrare but slightly increased with abiraterone. The overall discontinuation \nrate due to side effects was 12%. Patient -reported outcomes were \nimproved with the addition of abiraterone, with improvements in pain intensity progression, fatigue, functional decline, prostate cancer -related \nsymptoms, and overall health- related QOL .\n625 A limitation of this trial is that \nonly 27% of placebo -treated patients  received abiraterone or enzalutamide at progression, and only 52%  of these patients  received any life -\nprolonging therapy.623 \nA second randomized trial (STAMPEDE) of 1917  patients  with castration -\nnaïve prostate cancer  demonstrated similar OS  benefits.423 However , \nunlike LA TITUDE, STAMPEDE eligibilit y permitted patients  with high -risk \nN0,M0 disease ( 2 of 3 high- risk factors: stage T3/4, PSA >40, or Gleason  \nscore  8–10; n = 509), or N1, M0 disease (pelvic nodal metastases ; n = \n369) in addition to M1 patients , who made up the majority of patients  (n = \n941). The majority of patients  were newly diagnosed, while a minority had \nrecurrent , high- risk, or metastatic disease after local therapy (n = 98). \nThus, STAMPEDE was a heter ogeneous mix of patients with high- risk, \nnon-metastatic, node- positive, or M1 disease . In M1 patients, treatment \nwith abiraterone plus prednisone was continued until progression. In \npatients with N1  or M0 disease, 2 years of abiraterone plus prednisolone \nwas used if curative -intent EBRT  was uti lized.  OS was improved in the \noverall population (HR , 0.63; 95% CI , 0.5–0.76; P < .0001) and in the M1 \nand N1 subsets, without any heterogeneity of treatment effect by \nmetastatic status. The survival benefit of abiraterone was larger in patients  \n<70 years of age than those ≥70 years  (HR, 0.94 vs. HR, 0.51) . Patients  \nwho were older also suffered increased toxicities, which suggest s \nheterogeneity in clinical benefits by age and comorbidity. The secondary endpoint of FFS , which included  PSA recurrence , was improved overall \n(HR, 0.29; P < .0001) and in all subgroups regardless of M1 (HR , 0.31), \nN1 (HR,  0.29), or M0 (HR , 0.21) status. No heterogeneity for FFS was \nobserved based on subgroups or by age.  In this trial, subsequent life-\nprolonging therapy was  received by 58% of those  in the control group, \nwhich included 22% who received abiraterone and 26% who received \nenzalutamide. Thus, these data reflect a survival advantage of initial \nabiraterone in newly diagnosed patients  compared with deferr ing therapy \nto the CRPC setting.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-48 Adverse events in STAMPEDE were  similar to that reported in LA TITUDE, \nbut were  increased in patients  who were  older , with higher incidences of \ngrade 3– 5 adverse events  with abiraterone (47%  vs. 33%) and 9 versus 3 \ntreatment -related deaths. Severe hypertension or cardiac disorders were \nnoted in 10% of patients  and grade 3– 5 liver toxicity in 7%, which \nillustrat es the need for blood pressure and renal and hepatic function \nmonitoring.  \nTaken together, t hese data led the NCCN Panel to recommend \nabiraterone with 5 -mg once -daily prednisone as a treatment option with \nADT for patients  with newly diagnosed, M1, castration- naïve prostate \ncancer  (category 1). Alternatively, the fine- particle formulation of \nabiraterone can be used (category 2B; see Abiraterone Acetate in M1 \nCRPC, below). For patients  undergoing curative- intent treatment for N1 \ndisease, abiraterone can be added to EBRT with 2  to 3 years of \nneoadjuvant/concurrent/adjuvant ADT or can  be given with ADT for \ncastration- naïve disease  (without EBRT) . The fine- particle formulation of \nabiraterone is an option (category 2B; see Abiraterone Acetate in M1 \nCRPC, below).  However, there was insufficient survival , FFS data, and \nfollow- up available to recommend abiraterone for patients  with high -risk or \nvery-high- risk N0 M0 prostate cancer . Further follow -up and dedicated \nongoing c linical trials are needed in this curative -intent RT population.  \nAbiraterone can be given at 250 mg/day and administered following a low -\nfat breakfast, as an alternative to the dose of 1000 mg/day after an overnight fast (see Abiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC , below ).\n626 The cost \nsavings may reduce financial toxicity and improve adherence . \nApalutamide in Castration- Naïve Prostate Cancer  \nThe double- blind phase 3 TITAN clinical trial randomized 1052 patients \nwith metastatic, castration -naïve prostate cancer to ADT with apalutamide \n(240 mg/day)  or placebo.627 Participants were stratified by Gleason score \nat diagnosis, geographic region, and previous docetaxel treatment. The median follow -up was 22.7 months. Both primary endpoints were met: \nradiographic PFS (68.2% vs. 47.5% at 24 months; HR for radiographic progression or death, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39– 0.60; P < .001) and OS (82.4% \nvs. 73.5% at 24 months; HR for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51– 0.89; P = .005). \nAdverse events that were more common with apalutamide than with \nplacebo included rash, hypothyroidism, and ischemi c heart disease. \nHealth -related QOL was maintained during treatment.\n628 At final analysis of \nTITAN, median OS was improved with apalutamide plus ADT compared \nwith ADT alone after a median follow -up of 44 months (NR vs . 52.2 \nmonths ; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53– 0.79; P < .001)629 \nApalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration- naïve \nprostate cancer.

Adverse events \nassociated with enzalutamide in these trials included fatigue, seizures, and \nhypertension.632,633 \nEnzalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration- naïve \nprostate cancer.  \nIntermittent Versus Continuous ADT  \nADT is associated with substantial side effects, which generally increase with the duration of treatment. Intermittent ADT is an approach based on \nthe premise that cycles of androgen deprivation followed by re -exposure \nmay delay “androgen independence,” reduce treatment morbidity, and \nimprove QOL.\n634,635 Some patients  who have no ADT- related morbidity \nmay find the uncertainty of intermittent ADT not worthwhile. Intermittent ADT requires c lose monitoring of PSA and testosterone levels, especially \nduring off -treatment periods , and patients may need to switch to \ncontinuous therapy upon signs of disease progression.   \nIntermittent ADT in N on-Metastatic Disease  \nThe Canadian- led PR.7 trial was a phase 3 trial of intermittent versus \ncontinuous ADT in patients with non- metastatic prostate cancer who \nexperienced biochemical recurrence  after primary or post -recurrence \nEBRT.636 One thousand three hundred eighty -six patients with PSA >3 \nng/mL were randomly assigned to intermittent ADT or continuous ADT. At \na median follow -up of 6.9 years, the intermittent approach was non- inferior \nto continuous ADT with respect to OS (8.8 vs. 9.1  years, respectively; HR, \n1.02; 95% CI, 0.86– 1.21). More patients died from  prostate cancer in the \nintermittent ADT arm (120 of 690 patients) than in the continuous ADT arm \n(94 of 696 patients), but  this was balanced by more non- prostate cancer deaths in the continuous ADT arm. Physical function, fatigue, urinary \nproblems, hot flashes, libido, and erectile dysfunction showed modest \nimprovement in the intermittent ADT group. The test population was \nheterogenous, so it remains unclear which of these asymptomatic patients \nbenefitted  from treatment. It is possible that many of these patients could \nhave delayed ADT without harm. The test population had a low disease burden and 59% of deaths in the trial were not related to prostate cancer. \nFollow -up longer than 6.9 years may be required for disease- specific \ndeaths to out -balance deaths by other causes.  \nAn unplanned Cox regression analysis of the trial showed that patients  \nwith Gleason sum greater than 7 in the continuous ADT arm had a median \nsurvival (8 years) that was 14 months longer than those with the same \nGleason sum in the intermittent ADT arm (6.8 years).\n636 In this situation, \npatients should be given the option to weigh the effects of ADT on QOL  \nagainst a possible impact on survival , although pathology was not centrally \nreviewed and the study was not powered to detect small differences in survival based on Gleason sum.\n637 \nThe multinational European ICELAND trial randomized 702 participants with locally advanced or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer to \ncontinuous or intermittent ADT.\n638 Clinical outcomes, which included time \nto PSA progression, PSA PFS, OS, mean PSA levels over time, QOL, and \nadverse events, were similar between the arms.  \nA 2015 meta -analysis identified 6 randomized controlled trials comparing \ncontinuous with intermittent ADT in patients  with locally advanced prostate \ncancer and found no difference in mortality and progression and an \nadvantage of the intermittent approach in terms of QOL and adverse \neffects.639 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-50 Intermittent ADT in Metastatic Disease  \nHussain and colleagues640 conducted the SWOG (Southwest Oncology \nGroup) 9346 trial to compare intermittent and continuous ADT in patients \nwith metastatic  disease . After 7 months of induction ADT, 1535 patients \nwhose PSA dropped to 4 ng/mL or below (thereby demonstrating \nandrogen sensitivity) were randomized to intermittent or continuous ADT. \nAt a median follow- up of 9.8 years, median survival was 5.1 years for the \nintermittent ADT arm and 5.8 years for the continuous ADT arm. The HR \nfor death with intermittent ADT was 1.10 with a 90% CI  between 0.99 and \n1.23, which exceeded the prespecified upper boundary of 1.20 for non-inferiority. The authors stated that the survival results were inconclusive, \nand that a 20% greater mortality risk with the intermittent approach cannot \nbe ruled out. The study demonstrated better erectile function and mental \nhealth in pat ients receiving intermittent ADT at 3 months, but the \ndifference became insignificant thereafter, most likely due to contamination of assessments of those on the intermittent arm who may \nhave returned to  ADT at the prespecified time points.  A secondary \nanalysis of SWOG 9346 showed that intermittent ADT did not reduce  \nendocrine,  bone,  or cognitive events, whereas it increased the incidence \nof ischemic and thrombotic events .\n641 \nIn a post -hoc stratification analysis of the trial, patients with minimal \ndisease had a median survival of 5.4 years when receiving intermittent \nADT versus 6.9 years when receiving continuous ADT (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, \n0.98– 1.43).640 The median survival was 4.9 years in the intermittent ADT \narm compared to 4.4 years in the continuous ADT arm for patients with extensive disease (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.85– 1.22). These subgroup \nanalyses are hypothesis -generating.  \nA population- based analysis  that included 9772 patients with advanced \nprostate cancer aged greater than or equal to 66 years showed that intermittent ADT reduced the risks of total serious cardiovascular events by 36%, heart failure by 38%, and pathologic fracture by 48% , compared \nwith continuous ADT.\n642 Furthermore, several  meta -analyses of \nrandomized controlled trials reported no difference in survival between \nintermittent ADT and continuous ADT.643- 645 Another recent analysis \nconcluded that the non -inferiority of intermittent to continuous ADT in \nterms of survival has not been clearly demonstrated.646 Still, the \nintermittent approach leads to marked improvement in QOL compared to \nthe continuous approach in most studies, and the Panel believes that \nintermittent ADT should be strongly considered.  \nA more personalized approach could be to treat all patients with metastatic disease with ADT.  After 7 months of ADT, patients can be assigned a risk \ncategory based on the PSA value at that time point\n618: low risk is defined \nby a PSA less than 0.2 ng/mL (median survival of 75 months); \nintermediate risk  is defined by a PSA between 0.2 and 4.0 ng/mL (median \nsurvival of 44 months), and high risk is defined by a PSA higher than 4.0 \nng/mL (median survival of 13 months). Those patients who have few or no \nsymptoms related to ADT after 7 months of therapy will not benefit from \nintermittent ADT in terms of QOL, and therefore continuous ADT is \nreasonable because it is easier to administer.637 However, for those \npatients with significant side effects impacting QOL, intermittent ADT should be considered for those with low or intermediate risk after a \ndiscussion about the impact on survival. A final consideration is based on \na subgroup analysis o f S9346 that suggested that those who initially \npresent with pain have better survival on continuous therapy than intermittent therapy.  \nAdverse Effects of Traditional ADT \nADT has a variety of adverse effects including hot flashes, vasomotor \ninstability, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, shrinkage of penis and \ntesticles, loss of muscle mass and strength, fatigue, anemia, breast \nenlargement and tenderness/soreness, depression and mood swings, hair PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

In general, the side effects of continuous \nADT increase with the duration of treatment. In addition, some forms of \nADT may result in lower risk than others. For example, relugolix  was \nassociated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events  than \nleuprolide in the phase 3 HERO study (also see ADT for Castration -Naïve \nDisease, above) , although the FDA considered these  results in HERO to \nbe exploratory and therefore did not allow for these data to be included in \nthe prescribing information for relugolix .614 Overall , very limited prospective \nhead- to-head studies to date have evaluat ed the cardiovascular toxicity of \nLHRH agonists versus LHRH antagonists as the primary endpoint . \nRecent evidence suggests that a link between ADT and cognitive decline, dementia, or future Alzheimer’s disease may exist, although data are \ninconsistent, the risk is low, and the link remains to be proven.\n650- 657 \nPatients and their medical providers should be advised about these risks \nprior to treatment.  Many side effects of ADT are reversible or can be \navoided or mitigated. For example, physical activity can counter many of \nthese symptoms and should be recommended (see NCCN Guidelines for \nSurvivorship, available at www.NCCN.org ). Use of statins also should be \nconsidered.  \nBone Health During ADT  \nMedical or surgical ADT is associated with greater risk for osteoporosis \nand clinical fractures. In large population- based studies, for example, ADT \nwas associated with a 21% to 54% relative increase in fracture risk.658- 660 \nLonger treatment duration conferred greater fracture risk. Age and \ncomorbidity also were associated with higher fracture incidence. In a \npopulation- based cohort of 3295 patients, surgical castration was \nassociated with a significantly lower risk of fractures  than medical castration using an  LHRH agonist  (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62– 0.94; \nP = .01 ).613 ADT increases bone turnover and decreases bone mineral \ndensity,661- 664 a surrogate for fracture risk in patients with non- metastatic \ndisease. Bone mineral density of the hip and spine decreases by approximately 2% to 3% per year during initial therapy. Most studies have \nreported that bone mineral density continues to decline steadily during \nlong- term therapy. ADT significantly decreases muscle mass,\n665 and \ntreatment -related sarcopenia appears to contribute to frailty and increased \nrisk of falls in patients  who are  older . \nThe NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends screening and treatment for \nosteoporosis according to guidelines for the general population from the \nNational Osteoporosis Foundation.666 A baseline bone mineral density \nstudy should be considered for the  patients  on ADT. The National \nOsteoporosis Foundation guidelines include: 1) calcium (1000– 1200 mg \ndaily from food and supplements) and vitamin D3 (400– 1000 IU daily);  and \n2) additional treatment for males aged greater than or equal to 50 years \nwith low bone mass (T -score between -1.0 and -2.5, osteopenia) at the \nfemoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine by dual -energy x -ray \nabsorptiometry (DEXA) scan and a 10- year probability of hip fractur e \ngreater than or equal to 3% or a 10- year probability of a major \nosteoporosis -related fracture greater than or equal to 20%. Fracture risk \ncan be assessed using the algorithm FRAX®, recently released by  \nWHO.667 ADT should be considered “secondary osteoporosis” using the \nFRAX® algorithm.  \nEarlier  randomized controlled trials demonstrated that bisphosphonates \nincrease bone mineral density, a surrogate for fracture risk, during ADT.668-\n670 In 2011, the FDA approved denosumab as a treatment to prevent bone \nloss and fractures during ADT. Denosumab binds to and inhibits  the \nreceptor activator of NF -κB ligand (RANKL) to blunt  osteoclast function \nand delay generalized bone resorption and local bone destruction.

At 24 months, denosumab increased bone \nmineral density by 6.7% and reduced fractures (1.5% vs. 3.9%) compared \nto placebo.671 Denosumab also was approved for prevention of SREs  in \npatients with bone metastasis (see Chemotherapy , Immunotherapy , and \nTargeted Therapy ). \nCurrently, treatment with denosumab (60 mg every 6 months),  zoledronic \nacid (5 mg IV annually),  or alendronate (70 mg PO  weekly) is \nrecommended when the absolute fracture risk warrants drug therapy . A \nbaseline DEXA scan before start of therapy and a follow -up DEXA scan \nafter one year of therapy is recommended by the International Society for \nClinical Densitometry to monitor response. Use of biochemical markers of \nbone turnover is not recommended. There are no existing guidelines on \nthe optimal frequency of vitamin D testing, but vitamin D levels can be \nmeasured when DEXA scans are obtained.  \nDiabetes and Cardiovascular Disease  \nIn a landmark population -based study, ADT was associated with higher \nincidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.672 After controlling for \nother variables , which includ ed age and comorbidity, ADT with an  LHRH \nagonist was associated with increased  risk for new diabetes ( HR, 1.44; P \n< .001) , coronary artery disease (HR,  1.16; P < .001), and myocardial \ninfarction (HR, 1.11; P  = .03).  Studies  that evaluated the potential \nrelationship between A DT and cardiovascular mortality  have produced \nmixed results .584,672- 679 In a Danish cohort of 31,571 patients  with prostate \ncancer , medical castration was associated with an increased risk for \nmyocardial infarction ( HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16– 1.49) and stroke (HR, 1.19; \n95% CI, 1.06– 1.35) whereas surgical castration was not.680 Other \npopulation- based studies resulted in similar findings.613,681 However, a \nTaiwan National Health Insurance Research Database analysis found no difference in ischemic events with LHRH agonist therapy or \norchiectomy.682 A French database study showed the cardiovascular risk \nto be similar in patients  taking LHRH agonists and antagonists.683 \nHowever, some data suggest that LHRH antagonists might be associated \nwith a lower ri sk of cardiac events within 1 year in patients  with preexisting \ncardiovascular disease (history of myocardial ischemia, coronary artery \ndisease, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, angina pectoris, \nor coronary artery bypass) compared with agonists.612 Patients with a \nrecent history of cardiovascular disease  appear to have higher risk,684 and \nincreased physical activity may decrease the symptoms and \ncardiovascular side effects of patients  treated with ADT.685 \nSeveral mechanisms may contribute to greater risk for diabetes and \ncardiovascular disease during ADT. ADT increases fat mass and \ndecreases lean body mass.665,686,687 ADT with a n LHRH agonist increases \nfasting plasma insulin levels688,689 and decreases insulin sensitivity .690 ADT \nalso increases serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.688,691  \nADT may also prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider \nwhether the benefits of ADT outweigh the potential risks in patients with \ncongenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure,  and frequent \nelectrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong \nthe QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected, and \nperiodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be \nconsidered.  \nCardiovascular disease and diabetes are leading causes of morbidity and \nmorta lity in the general population.  Based on the observed adverse \nmetabolic effects of ADT and the association between ADT and higher incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, screening for and \nintervention to prevent/treat diabetes and cardiovas cular disease are \nrecommended for  patients  receivin g ADT.

The use of ADT \nmonotherapy in this setting is discouraged unless there are clear contraindications to combination therapy. Treatment intensification options \ninclude doublet therapy of ADT with abiraterone, apalutamide, or \nenzalutamide; triplet therapy of ADT with docetaxel and abiraterone or \ndarolutamide; or ADT with EBRT to the primary tumor for low -metastatic \nburden. The data supporting doublet or triplet therapy in this setting are \ndiscussed below. The doublet and triplet therapies are all category 1, \npreferred options; the fine- particle formulation of abiraterone (discussed in \nAbiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC , below) can be added to ADT as a \ncategory 2B, other recommended option. ADT with EBRT to the primary \ntumor for patients with low metastatic burden is discussed in EBRT to the \nPrimary Tumor in Low -Metastatic -Burden M1 Disease, above . \nDoublet Therapies for Castration -Sensitive Prostate Cancer  \nAbiraterone Acetate in Castration -Sensitive Prostate Cancer  \nIn February 2018, the FDA approved abiraterone in combination with \nprednisone for metastatic castration- sensitive prostate cancer. This \napproval was based on two randomized phase 3 clinical trials of \nabiraterone and low -dose prednisone plus ADT in patients wi th newly \ndiagnosed metastatic prostate cancer or high- risk or node- positive disease \n(STAMPEDE and LATITUDE) that demonstrated improved OS over ADT \nalone.623  \nIn LATITUDE, 1199 patients with high- risk, metastatic, castration -sensitive \nprostate cancer were randomized to abiraterone with prednisone 5 mg once daily or matching placebos. High- risk disease was defined as at least \ntwo of the following: Gleason score 8– 10, ≥3 bone metastases, and \nvisceral metastases.623 Efficacy was demonstrated at the first interim \nanalysis, and the trial was unblinded. The primary endpoint of OS was met and favored abiraterone (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51 –0.76; P < .0001). \nEstimated 3- year OS rates improved from 49% to 66% at 30 months \nfollow- up. Secondary endpoints were improved and included delayed \ncastration- resistant radiographic progression (from median 14.8– 33.2 \nmonths), PSA progression (7.4– 33.2 months), tim e to pain progression, \nand initiation of chemotherapy. After the first interim  analysis, 72 patients \ncrossed over from placebo to abiraterone. Final OS analysis of LATITUDE \nafter a median follow -up of 51.8 months showed median OS was \nsignificantly longer in the abiraterone group than in the placebo group (53.3 months vs. 36.5 months ; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56– 0.78; P < .0001).\n624 \nAdverse events were higher with abiraterone and prednisone but were \ngenerally mild in nature and largely related to mineralocorticoid excess (ie, \nhypertension, hypokalemia, edema), hormonal effects (ie, fatigue, hot \nflushes), and liver toxicity.623 Cardiac events, such as atrial fibrillation, were \nrare but slightly increased with abiraterone. The overall discontinuation \nrate due to side effects was 12%. Patient -reported outcomes were \nimproved with the addition of abiraterone, with improvements in pain intensity progression, fatigue, functional decline, prostate cancer -related \nsymptoms, and overall health- related QOL.\n625 A limitation of this trial is that \nonly 27% of placebo -treated patients received abiraterone or enzalutamide \nat progression, and only 52% of these patients received any life -\nprolonging therapy.623 \nThe second randomized trial (STAMPEDE) of 1917 patients with \ncastration- sensitive prostate cancer demonstrated similar OS benefits.423 \nHowever, unlike LATITUDE, STAMPEDE eligibility permitted patients with \nhigh- risk N0,M0 disease (2 of 3 high- risk factors: stage T3/4, PSA >40, or PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

The majority of patients were newly diagnosed, while \na minority had recurrent, high- risk, or metas tatic disease after local \ntherapy (n = 98). Thus, STAMPEDE was a heterogeneous mix of patients with high -risk, non -metastatic, node- positive, or M1 disease. In M1 \npatients, treatment with abiraterone plus prednisone was continued until progression. In pati ents with N1 or M0 disease, 2 years of abiraterone plus \nprednisolone was used if curative- intent EBRT was utilized. OS was \nimproved in the overall population (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.5– 0.76; P < .0001) \nand in the M1 and N1 subsets, without any heterogeneity of treatment effect by metastatic status. The survival benefit of abiraterone was larger \nin patients <70 years of age than those ≥70 years (HR, 0.94 vs. HR, 0.51) . \nPatients ≥70 years also suffered increased toxicities, which suggests heterogeneity in clinical benefits by age and comorbidity. The secondary \nendpoint of FFS, which included PSA recurrence, was improved overall \n(HR, 0.29; P < .0001) and in all subgroups regardless of M1 (HR, 0.31), \nN1 (HR, 0.29), or M0 (HR, 0.21) status. No heterogeneity for FFS was observed based on subgroups or by age. In this trial, subsequent life-\nprolonging therapy was received by 58% of those in the con trol group, \nwhich included 22% who received abiraterone and 26% who received \nenzalutamide. Thus, these data reflect a survival advantage of initial \nabiraterone in newly diagnosed patients compared with deferring therapy \nto the CRPC setting.  \nAdverse events in STAMPEDE were similar to that reported in LATITUDE, \nbut were increased in patients ≥70 years, with higher incidences of grade \n3–5 adverse events with abiraterone (47% vs. 33%) and 9 versus 3 \ntreatment -related deaths. Severe hypertension or cardiac disorders were \nnoted in 10% of patients and grade 3– 5 liver toxicity in 7%, which \nillustrates the need for blood pressure and renal and hepatic function monitoring.  Taken together, these data led the NCCN Panel to recommend \nabiraterone with 5 -mg once -daily prednisone as a treatment option with \nADT for patients with newly diagnosed, M1, castration- sensitive prostate \ncancer (category 1). Alternatively, the fine- particle  formulation of \nabiraterone can be used (category 2B; see Abiraterone Acetate in M1 \nCRPC, below).  \nAbiraterone can be given at 250 mg/day and administered following a low -\nfat breakfast as an alternative to the dose of 1000 mg/day after an \novernight fast (see Abiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC , below).\n626 The cost \nsavings may reduce financial toxicity and improve adherence.  \nApalutamide in Castration -Sensitive Prostate Cancer  \nThe double- blind phase 3 TITAN clinical trial randomized 1052 patients \nwith metastatic, castration -sensitive prostate cancer to ADT with \napalutamide (240 mg/day) or placebo.627 Participants were stratified by \nGleason score at diagnosis, geographic region, and previous docetaxel \ntreatment. The median follow -up was 22.7 months. Both primary endpoints \nwere met: radiographic PFS (68.2% vs. 47.5% at 24 months; HR for radiographic progression or death, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39– 0.60; P < .001) and \nOS (82.4% vs. 73.5% at 24 months; HR for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51–0.89; P = .005). Adverse events that were more common with apalutamide \nthan with placebo included rash, hypothyroidism, and ischemi c heart \ndisease. Health -related QOL was maintained during treatment.\n628 At final \nanalysis of TITAN, median OS was improved with apalutamide plus ADT \ncompared with ADT alone after a median follow -up of 44 months (NR vs. \n52.2 months; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53– 0.79; P < .001)629 \nApalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration-\nsensitive prostate cancer.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-55 Enzalutamide in Castration -Sensitive Prostate Cancer  \nThe open- label randomized phase 3 ENZAMET clinical trial compared \nenzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus ADT (LHRH analog or surgical castration) \nwith a first -generation antiandrogen (bicalutamide, nilutamide, or \nflutamide) plus ADT in 1125 patients with metastati c castration- sensitive \nprostate cancer.632 Stratification was by volume of disease, planned use of \nearly docetaxel, planned use of bone antiresorptive therapy, comorbidity \nscore, and trial site. The primary endpoint of OS was met at the first \ninterim analysis with median follow -up of 34 months (HR  for death, 0.67; \n95% CI, 0.52– 0.86; P = .002). Enzalutamide also improved secondary \nendpoints, such as PFS using PSA levels and clinical PFS. An additional \nanalysis was triggered at 470 deaths.692 After a median follow -up of 68 \nmonths, the 5- year OS rate was again lower in the first -generation \nantiandrogen group than in the enzalutamide group (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58– 0.84; P < .0001). The median OS was not reached.  \nIn the double- blind randomized phase 3 ARCHES clinical, 1150 patients \nwith metastatic castration -sensitive prostate cancer were randomized to \nreceive ADT with either enzalutamide (160 mg/day) or placebo. Participants were stratified by disease volume and prior docetaxel use. \nThe primary endpoint was radiographic PFS, which was improved in the \nenzalutamide group after a median follow -up of 14.4 months (19.0 months \nvs. not reached; HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.30– 0.50; P < .001).\n633 At the final, \nprespecified OS analysis, median OS was not met in either group, but a \n34% reduction in the risk of death was observed in those receiving \nenzalutamide v ersus placebo (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53– 0.81; P < .001 ).693 \nThis result could be an underestimate of the effect of enzalutamide, since \napproximately 32% of the patients assigned placebo crossed over to \nenzalutamide after unblinding.  \nThe safety of enzalutamide in these trials was similar to that seen in \nprevious trials in the castration- resistant setting. Adverse events associated with enzalutamide in these trials included fatigue, seizures, and hypertension.\n632,633 \nEnzalutamide is a category 1 option for patients with M1 castration-\nsensitive prostate cancer.  The FDA approved this indication in December \n2019.  \nDocetaxel in Castration -Sensitive Prostate Cancer  \nDocetaxel has been studied as an upfront option for patients with castration- sensitive prostate cancer and distant metastases based on \nresults from two phase 3 trials (ECOG 3805/CHAARTED and \nSTAMPEDE).\n422,694 CHAARTED randomized 790 patients with metastatic, \ncastration- sensitive prostate cancer to docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV q3 weeks x \n6 doses) plus ADT or ADT alone.694 After a median follow -up of 53.7 \nmonths, the patients in the combination arm experienced a longer OS than those in the ADT arm (57.6 months vs. 47.2 months; HR, 0.72; 95% CI, \n0.59– 0.89; P = .002).\n695 Subgroup analysis showed that the survival \nbenefit was more pronounced in the 65% of participants with high -volume \ndisease (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50– 0.79; P < .001). Patients with low \nmetastatic burden in CHAARTED did not derive a survival benefit from the \ninclusion of docetaxel (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.70– 1.55; P = .86).  \nThe STAMPEDE trial, a multi -arm, multi -stage phase 3 trial, included \npatients with both M0 and M1 castration- sensitive prostate cancer.422 The \nresults in the M1 population confirmed the survival advantage of adding \ndocetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV q3 weeks x 6 doses) to ADT seen in the \nCHAARTED trial. In STAMPEDE, extent of disease was not evaluated in the 1087 patients with metastatic disease, but the median OS for all \npatients with M1 disease was 5.4 years in the ADT- plus-docetaxel arm \nversus 3.6 years in the ADT- only arm (a difference of 1.8 years between \ngroups compared with a 1.1- year difference in CHAARTED).

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-56 Patients with low metastatic burden did not have definitively improved \nsurvival outcomes in the ECOG CHAARTED study or a similar European \ntrial (GETUG -AFU 15).694,696,697 Furthermore, the triplet options of ADT with \ndocetaxel and either abiraterone or darolutamide showed improved OS \nover ADT with docetaxel (see below). The panel therefore does not \ninclude docetaxel with ADT as an option for patients with metastatic \ncastrat ion-sensitive prostate cancer. Rather, patients with high- volume \ncastration- sensitive metastatic prostate cancer who are fit for \nchemotherapy should be considered for triplet therapy.  \nTriplet Therapies for Castration -Sensitive Prostate Cancer  \nData from the PEACE- 1 and ARASENS trials indicate that triplet therapies \nof ADT with docetaxel and a novel hormone therapy —either abiraterone or \ndarolutamide—improve OS over ADT with docetaxel.698,699 These trials are \ndiscussed below. Both of these combinations are included as category 1, preferred options for patients with metastatic castration- sensitive prostate \ncancer, and their use is encouraged for patients with high- volume de novo \ndisease who are  fit for chemotherapy.  \nDocetaxel Plus Abiraterone in Castration -Sensitive Prostate Cancer  \nPEACE- 1 was an international, open- label, randomized, phase 3 study \nconducted in seven European countries.698 Using a 2 × 2 factorial design, \n1173 patients with de novo metastatic prostate cancer were randomized at \na 1:1:1:1 ratio to standard of care (ADT alone or with docetaxel), standard \nof care with RT , standard of care with abiraterone, or standard of care with \nradiation and abiraterone. The two primary endpoints of the trial were radiographic PFS and OS. Adjusted Cox regression modelling showed no \ninteraction between abiraterone and RT , so data were pooled for the \nanalysis of abiraterone efficacy. Consistent with results of older studies, radiographic PFS was longer in patients who received abiraterone than in \nthose that did not (HR, 0.54; 99.9% CI, 0.41– 0.71; P < .0001) as was OS \n(HR, 082; 95.1% CI, 0.69 –0.98; P = .030).  As part of the analysis, the efficacy of abiraterone was assessed in the \npopulation that received docetaxel. As in the overall population, \nradiographic PFS (HR, 0.50; 99.9% CI, 0.34– 0.71; P < .0001) and OS \n(HR, 0.75; 95.1% CI, 0.59– 0.95; P = .017) were longer in those receiving \nall three therapies compared with those only receiving ADT and docetaxel. \nThe populations receiving the triplet and doublet therapies experienced \nsimilar rates neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and neuropathy, \nalthough grade  ≥3 adverse events occurred in 63% of patients who \nreceived the triplet combination compared with 52% of those receiving \nADT and docetaxel.  \nDocetaxel Plus Darolutamide in Castration -Sensitive Prostate Cancer  \nThe international, phase 3 trial ARASENS trial, the second phase 3 trial \nevaluating a triplet  therapy , randomized 1306 patients with metastatic \ncastration- sensitive prostate cancer to receive ADT and docetaxel with \neither darolutamide or matching placebo.699 The primary endpoint, OS, \nwas improved in the darolutamide group at 4 years (62.7%; 95% CI, 58.7 –\n66.7) compared with the placebo group (50.4%; 95% CI, 46.3– 54.6). The \nrisk of death was lower in the darolutamide group by about 32% (HR, 0.68; \n95% CI, 0.57– 0.80; P < .001). The addition of darolutamide also showed \nsignificant benefits over placebo for secondary efficacy endpoints, including time to CRPC (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.30– 0.42; P < .001), skeletal \nevent –free survival (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52– 0.72; P < .001 ), and time to \ninitiation of subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy (HR, 0.39; 95% \nCI, 0.33 –0.46; P < .001).  \nAdverse events of any grade, grade 3 to 5 adverse events, and serious \nadverse events occurred at similar incidence levels between the two arms. \nMany of these were known effects of docetaxel. The most frequent \nadverse events were alopecia (40.5% of patients  in the darolutamide arm \nvs. 40.6% with placebo), neutropenia (39.3% vs . 38.8%), fatigue (33.1% \nvs. 32.9%), and anemia (27.8% vs 25.1%).

CRPC is prostate cancer that progresses clinically, radiographically, or biochemically despite castrate levels of serum \ntestosterone (<50 ng/dL).\n700 Patients whose disease progresses to CRPC \nduring primary ADT should receive a laboratory assessment to assure a \ncastrate level of testosterone (<50 ng/dL; <1.7 nmol/L). Imaging tests may \nbe indicated to monitor for signs of distant metastases. Factors aff ecting \nthe frequency of imaging include individual risk, age, overall patient health, \nPSA velocity, and Gleason grade.  \nFor patients who develop CRPC, ADT with an LHRH agonist or antagonist \nshould be continued to maintain castrate serum levels of testosterone \n(<50 ng/dL).  \nPatients with CRPC and no signs of distant metastasis on conventional imaging studies (M0) can consider monitoring with continued ADT if \nPSADT is greater than 10 months (preferred), because these patients will \nhave a relatively indolent disease history.\n701 Secondary hormone therapy \nwith continued ADT is an option mainly for patients with shorter PSADT \n(≤10 months) as described below.  \nFor patients who develop metastatic CRPC, metastatic lesion biopsy is recommended, as is MSI/MMR testing, if not previously performed. If MSI -\nH or dMMR is found, referral to genetic counseling should be made to assess for the possibility of Lynch syndrome.  These patients should also have germline and tumor testing to check for mutations in homologous \nrecombination repair ( HRR ) genes (eg, BRCA1 , BRCA2 , ATM , PALB2 , \nFANCA, RAD51D, CHEK2, CDK12 ) if not done previously.\n702 This \ninformation may be used for genetic counseling, early use of platinum chemotherapy, or understanding eligibility for biomarker -directed \ntreatments or clinical trials. TMB testing should also be considered for patients with metastatic CRPC to inform possible use of pembrolizumab in \nlater lines of therapy (see Pembrolizumab, below).  \nADT is continued in patients with metastatic CRPC while additional \ntherapies, including secondary hormone therapies, chemotherapies, \nimmunotherapies, radiopharmaceuticals, and/or targeted therapies, are \nsequentially applied, as discussed in the sections that follow; all patients \nshould receive best supportive care. The Panel defined treatment options \nfor patients with metastatic CRPC based on previous exposure to \ndocetaxel and to a novel hormone therapy. Novel hormone therapies \ninclude abiraterone, enzalutamide, darolutamide, or apalutamide. \nAbiraterone given as part of neoadjuvant/concomitant/adjuvant ADT with \nEBRT is not considered prior novel hormonal therapy.  \nThe decision to initiate therapy in the CRPC setting after disease progression on one or more treatments should be based on the available \nhigh- level evidence of safety, efficacy, and tolerability of these agents and \nthe application of this evidence to an i ndividual patient. Prior exposures to \ntherapeutic agents should be considered. Data to inform the optimal \nsequence for delivery of these agents in patients with metastatic CRPC is \nlimited (see Sequencing of Therapy in CRPC , below). Choice of therapy is \nbased largely on clinical considerations, which include patient preferences, \nprior treatment, presence or absence of visceral disease, symptoms, and \npotential side effects.  \nNCCN recommends that patients being treated for CRPC be closely monitored with radiologic imaging (ie, CT, bone imaging), PSA tests, and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

Therapy should be continued \nuntil clinical progression or intolerability, with consideration of the fact that \neven in cases where PSA remains undetectable, bone imaging may reveal \nprogression.703,704 The sequential use of these agents is reasonable in a \npatient who remains a candidate for further systemic therapy. Clinical trial \nand best supportive care are additional options.  \nSecondary Hormone Therapy for CRPC \nResearch has shown enhancement of autocrine and/or paracrine \nandrogen synthesis in the tumor microenvironment of patients receiving \nADT.705,706 Androgen signaling consequent to non -gonadal sources of \nandrogen in CRPC refutes earlier beliefs that CRPC was resistant to \nfurther hormone therapies. The development of novel hormonal agents \ndemonstrating efficacy in the non- metastatic and metastatic CRP C setting \ndramatically changed the paradigm of CRPC treatment.  \nAbiraterone Acetate in M1 CRPC  \nIn April 2011, the FDA approved the androgen synthesis inhibitor, \nabiraterone, in combination with low -dose prednisone, for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic CRPC who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel.  \nFDA approval in the post -docetaxel, metastatic CRPC setting was based \non the results of a phase 3, randomized, placebo- controlled trial (COU -AA-\n301) in patients with metastatic CRPC previously treated with docetaxel -\ncontaining regimens.\n707,708 Patients were randomized to receive either \nabiraterone 1000 mg orally once daily (n = 797) or placebo once daily (n = 398), and both arms received daily prednisone. In the final analysis, \nmedian survival was 15.8 versus 11.2 months in the abiraterone and \nplacebo arm, respectively (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64– 0.86; P < .0001).\n708 \nTime to radiographic progression, PSA decline, and pain palliation also \nwere improved by abiraterone.708,709 FDA approval in the pre- docetaxel setting occurred in December 2012, \nand was based on the randomized phase 3 COU -AA-302 trial of \nabiraterone and prednisone (n = 546) versus prednisone alone (n = 542) \nin patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, metastatic \nCRPC.710 Most participants in this trial were not taking narcotics for cancer \npain and none had visceral metastatic disease or prior ketoconazole \nexposure. The coprimary endpoint of radiographic PFS was improved by \ntreatment from 8.3 to 16.5 months (HR, 0.53; P  < .001). OS was improved \nat final analysis with a median follow -up of 49.2 months (34.7 months vs. \n30.3 months; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70– 0.93; P = .003).711 Key secondary \nendpoints of time to symptomatic deterioration, time to chemotherapy \ninitiation, time to pain progression, and PSA PFS improved significantly \nwith abiraterone treatment; PSA declines (62% vs. 24% with >50% \ndecline) and radiographic responses  (36% vs. 16% RECIST responses) \nwere more common.  \nThe most common adverse reactions with abiraterone/prednisone (>5%) \nwere fatigue (39%); back or joint discomfort (28% –32%); peripheral \nedema (28%); diarrhea, nausea, or constipation (22%); hypokalemia \n(17%); hypophosphatemia (24%); atrial fibrillation (4%); muscle discomfort \n(14% ); hot flushes (22%); urinary tract infection; cough; hypertension \n(22%, severe hypertension in 4%); urinary frequency and nocturia; dyspepsia; or upper respiratory tract infection. The most common adverse \ndrug reactions that resulted in drug discontinuati on were increased \naspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase (11% –12%), \nor cardiac disorders (19%, serious in 6%).  \nIn May 2018, the FDA approved a novel, fine- particle formulation of \nabiraterone, in combination with methylprednisolone, for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic CRPC. In studies of healthy males, this \nformulation at 500 mg was shown to be bioequivalent to 1000 mg of the \noriginator formulation.\n712,713 In a phase 2 therapeutic equivalence study, 53 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-59 patients with metastatic CRPC who were not treated previously with \nabiraterone, enzalutamide, radium -223, or chemotherapy (docetaxel for \nmetastatic CRPC completed ≥1 year prior to enrollment was allowed) were randomized to 500 mg daily of the new, fine- particle formulation plus 4 mg \nmethylprednisolone orally twice daily or to 1000 mg of the originator formulation daily plus 5 mg prednisone orally twice daily.\n714 Bioequivalence \nof these doses was confirmed based on serum testosterone levels, PSA \nresponse, and abiraterone pharmacokinetics. The rates of total and grade \n3/4 adverse events were similar between the arms, with musculoskeletal \nand connective tissue disor ders occurring more frequently in the \noriginator -treated patients (37.9% vs. 12.5%). The Panel believes that the \nfine-particle formulation of abiraterone can be used instead of the original \nformulation of abiraterone in the treatment of patients with metas tatic \nCRPC (category 2A).  \nBased on the studies described here, abiraterone is a category 1, \npreferred option for metastatic CRPC without prior novel hormone therapy. \nFor patients with metastatic CRPC and prior novel hormone therapy, \nabiraterone is included in the other recommended regimens  category. The \nfine-particle formulation of abiraterone is included under other \nrecommended options in all metastatic CRPC settings.  \nAbiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid (either oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily or oral methylprednisolone 4 mg twice daily, \ndepending on which formulation is given) to abrogate signs of \nmineralocorticoid excess that can result from treatment.  These signs \ninclude hypertension, hypokalemia, and peripheral edema. Thus, \nmonitoring of liver function, potassium and phosphate levels, and blood \npressure readings on a monthly basis is warranted during abiraterone \ntherapy. Symptom -directed assessment for cardiac disease also is \nwarranted, particularly in patients with pre- existing cardiovascular disease.  A randomized phase 2 non- inferiority study of 75 patients with M1 CRPC \ncompared 1000 mg/day abiraterone after an overnight fast with 250 \nmg/day after a low -fat breakfast.\n626 The primary endpoint was log change \nin PSA, with secondary endpoints of PSA response (≥50%) and PFS. The \nprimary endpoint favored the low -dose arm (log change in PSA, -1.59 vs. -\n1.19), as did the PSA response rate (58% vs. 50%), with an equal PFS of 9 mon ths in both arms. Noninferiority of the low dose was established \naccording to the predefined criteria. Therefore, abiraterone can be given at \n250 mg/day administered following a low -fat breakfast, as an alternative to \nthe dose of 1000 mg/day after an overnight fast in patients who will not \ntake or cannot afford the standard dose. The cost savings may reduce \nfinancial toxicity and improve adherence. Food impacts absorption \nunpredictably; side effects should be monitored and standard dosing \n(1000 mg on empty stomach) utilized if excess toxicity is observed on \nmodified dosing (250 mg with food).  \nAbiraterone with Dexamethasone in M1 CRPC  \nSwitching from prednisone to dexamethasone 1 mg/day can be \nconsidered for patients with M1 CRPC with disease progression on either \nformulation of abiraterone. Trials show improved PSA responses and PFS \nand acceptable safety using this strategy.  \nThe SWITCH study was a single- arm, open- label, phase 2 study of this \napproach with 26 enrolled patients.715 The primary endpoint, the proportion \nof patients with a PSA decline ≥30% in 6 weeks, was 46.2%. No \nsignificant toxicities were observed, and two radiologic responses were \nseen. In another study, 48 consecutive patients with metastatic CRPC, \nwith disease p rogression on abiraterone with prednisone, were switched to \nabiraterone with 0.5 mg/day dexamethasone.716 The primary endpoint of \nmedian PFS was 10.35 months, and PSA levels decreased or stabilized in 56% of patients after switching to dexamethasone.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-60 Enzalutamide in M0 and M1 CRPC  \nIn August 2012, the FDA approved enzalutamide, a next -generation \nantiandrogen, for treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC who had \nreceived prior docetaxel chemotherapy. Approval was based on the \nresults of the randomized, phase 3, placebo- controlled AFFIRM trial.717,718 \nAFFIRM randomized 1199 patients to enzalutamide or placebo in a 2:1 \nratio and the primary endpoint was OS. Median survival was improved \nwith enzalutamide from 13.6 to 18.4 months (HR, 0.63; P < .001). Survival \nwas improved in all subgroups analyzed. Secondary endpoints also were \nimproved significantly, which included the proportion of patients with >50% \nPSA decline (54% vs. 2%), radiographic response (29% vs. 4%), \nradiographic PFS (8.3 vs. 2.9 months), and time to first SRE (16.7 vs. 13.3 \nmonths). QOL meas ured using validated surveys was improved with \nenzalutamide compared to placebo. Adverse events were mild, and \nincluded fatigue (34% vs. 29%), diarrhea (21% vs. 18%), hot flushes (20% \nvs. 10%), headache (12% vs. 6%), and seizures (0.6% vs. 0%). The \nincidence of cardiac disorders did not differ between the arms. \nEnzalutamide is dosed at 160 mg daily. Patients in the AFFIRM study \nwere maintained on LHRH agonist/antagonist therapy and could receive \nbone supportive care medications. The seizure risk in the enzalutamide \nFDA label was 0.9% versus 0.6% in the manuscript.717,719  \nAnother phase 3 trial studied enzalutamide in the pre- chemotherapy \nsetting. The PREVAIL study randomly assigned 1717 patients with \nchemotherapy -naïve metastatic prostate cancer to daily enzalutamide or \nplacebo.720,721 The study was stopped early due to benefits shown in the \ntreatment arm. Compared to the placebo group, the enzalutamide group \nshowed improved median PFS (20.0 months vs. 5.4 months) and median \nOS (35.3 months vs. 31.3 months). Improvements in all secondar y \nendpoints were also observed (eg, the time until chemotherapy initiation or \nfirst SRE).  Two randomized clinical trials have reported that enzalutamide may be \nsuperior to bicalutamide for cancer control in metastatic CRPC. The \nTERRAIN study randomized 375 patients with treatment -naïve, metastatic \nCRPC to 160 mg/day enzalutamide or 50 mg/day bi calutamide in a 1:1 \nmanner.722 The enzalutamide group had significantly better PFS (defined \nas PSA progression, soft tissue progression, or development of additional \nbony metastases) compared to the bicalutamide group (median time to \nprogression, 15.7 vs. 5.8 months; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.34 –0.57).  \nThe STRIVE trial randomized 396 patients with M0 or M1 treatment -naïve \nCRPC to 160 mg/day enzalutamide or 50 mg/day bicalutamide in a 1:1 manner.\n723 The primary endpoint in this study was PFS, defined as either \nPSA progression, radiographic progression of disease, or death from any \ncause. Enzalutamide reduced the risk of progression or death by 76% \ncompared to bicalutamide (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.18– 0.32). These studies \ndemonstrated that enzalutamide extended PFS better than bicalutamide in \npatients choosing an antiandrogen for secondary hormonal therapy \ntreatment of CRPC. Bicalutamide can still be considered in some patients, \ngiven the different side- effect profiles of the agents and the increased cost \nof enzalutamide.  \nThus, enzalutamide represents a category 1, preferred treatment option for patients without prior novel hormone therapy in the metastatic CRPC \nsetting. For patients with metastatic CRPC and prior novel hormone \ntherapy, enzalutamide is included in the other recommended regimens  \ngroup of options.  \nThe randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled phase 3 PROSPER trial \nassessed the use of enzalutamide in 1401 patients with non- metastatic \nCRPC.\n724 Patients with PSADT less than or equal to 10 months were \nstratified according to PSADT (<6 months vs. ≥6 months) and use of bone -\nsparing agents and randomized 2:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus \nADT or placebo plus ADT.

Median OS \nwas longer in the enzalutamide group than in the placebo group (67.0 \nmonths vs. 56.3 months; HR for death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 –0.89; P = \n0.001).725 Adverse events included fatigue (33% vs. 14%), hypertension \n(12% vs. 5%), major adverse cardiovascular events (5% vs. 3%), and mental impairment disorders (5% vs. 2%). Patient -reported outcomes from \nPROSPER indicate that enzalutamide delayed pain progress ion, symptom \nworsening, and decrease in functional status, compared with placebo.\n726  \nThe FDA expanded approval for enzalutamide to include patients with non-metastatic CRPC in July 2018, and the Panel believes that patients \nwith M0 CRPC can be offered enzalutamide, if PSADT is less than or \nequal to 10 months (category 1, preferred option).  \nPatients receiving enzalutamide have no restrictions for food intake and \nconcurrent prednisone is permitted but not required.\n717  \nApalutamide in M0 CRPC  \nThe FDA approved apalutamide for treatment of patients with non-\nmetastatic CRPC in February 2018. This approval was based on the \nphase 3 SPARTAN trial of 1207 patients with M0 CRPC and PSADT less \nthan or equal to 10 months.727 Participants were stratified according to \nPSADT (>6 months vs. ≤6 months), use of bone -sparing agents, and the \npresence of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes (N0 vs. N1). After a median \nfollow- up of 20.3 months, apalutamide at 240 mg/day with ADT improved \nthe primary endpoint of metastasis -free survival over placebo with ADT \n(40.5 months vs. 16.2 months; HR for metastasis or death, 0.28; 95% CI, \n0.23– 0.35; P < .001). Adverse events included rash (24% vs. 5.5%), \nfracture (11% vs. 6.5%), and hypothyroidism (8% vs . 2%). In a \nprespecified exploratory analysis of SPARTAN, health- related QOL was \nmaintained in both the apalutamide and placebo groups.728 After a median follow -up of 52 months, final OS analysis showed that \nparticipants in SPARTAN experienced an improved median OS with \napalutamide versus placebo (73.9 months vs. 59.9 months; HR, 0.78; 95% \nCI, 0.64 –0.96; P = .016).729 This longer OS reached prespecified statistical \nsignificance, even though 19% of participants crossed over from placebo \nto apalutamide.  \nApalutamide is a category 1, preferred option for patients with M0 CRPC if PSADT is less than or equal to 10 months.  \nDarolutamide in M0 CRPC  \nThe FDA approved darolutamide for treatment of patients with non-\nmetastatic CRPC in July 2019. The phase 3 ARAMIS study randomized \n1509 patients with M0 CRPC and PSADT less than or equal to 10 months \n2:1 to darolutamide (600 mg twice daily) or placebo.\n730 Participants were \nstratified according to PSADT (>6 months vs. ≤6 months) and the use of \nosteoclast -targeted agents. The median follow -up time was 17.9 months. \nDarolutamide improved the primary endpoint of metastasis -free survival \ncompared to placebo (40. 4 months vs. 18.4 months; HR for metastasis or \ndeath, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.34– 0.50; P < .001).  \nPatients in the placebo group of ARAMIS crossed over to darolutamide (n = 170) or received other life- prolonging therapy (n = 137). Final analysis \noccurred after a median follow -up time of 29.0 months. The risk of death \nwas 31% lower in the darolutamide gr oup than in the placebo group (HR \nfor death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53– 0.88; P = .003).\n731 OS at 3 years was 83% \n(95% CI, 80– 86) in the darolutamide group compared with 77% (95% CI, \n72–81) in the placebo group. Adverse events that occurred more \nfrequently in the treatment arm included fatigue (12.1% vs. 8.7%), pain in \nan extremity (5.8% vs. 3.2%), and rash (2.9% vs. 0.9%). The incidence of \nfractures was similar between darolutamide and placebo (4.2% vs. \n3.6%).730 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-62 Darolutamide is a category 1, preferred option for patients with M0 CRPC \nif PSADT is less than or equal to 10 months.  \nOther Secondary Hormone Therapies  \nOther options for secondary hormone therapy include a first-generation \nantiandrogen, antiandrogen withdrawal, corticosteroid, or ketoconazole \n(adrenal enzyme inhibitor) with hydrocortisone.732- 734 However, none of \nthese strategies has yet been shown to prolong survival in randomized \nclinical trials.  \nA randomized phase 2 trial, TRANSFORMER, compared the effect of \nbipolar androgen therapy (BAT) with that of enzalutamide on PFS in 195 \npatients with asymptomatic, metastatic CRPC with prior progression on \nabiraterone.735 BAT involves rapid cycling between high and low serum \ntestosterone to disrupt the adaptive upregulation of the androgen receptor \nthat occurs with low testosterone levels. Patients in the BAT arm received \ntestosterone cypionate 400 mg intramuscularly once every 28 days. The \nPFS was 5.7 months in both arms (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.83 –1.55; P = .42). \nCrossover was allowed after disease progression, and OS was similar between the groups. BAT resulted in more favorable patient -reported \nQOL. The Panel awaits more data on this approach.   \nChemotherapy, Immunotherapy, and Targeted Therapy \nfor Metastatic CRPC \nResearch has expanded the therapeutic options for patients with \nmetastatic CRPC. In addition to the hormonal and radiopharmaceutical \ntherapies described in other sections, options include chemotherapy, \nimmunotherapy, and targeted therapy. As noted above, selection of \ntherapy depends on patient preferences, prior treatment exposures, the presence or absence of symptoms, the location of metastases, the \npresence of certain biomarkers, and consideration of potential side effec ts.  Docetaxel  \nTwo randomized phase 3 studies evaluated docetaxel -based regimens in \nsymptomatic or rapidly progressive CRPC (TAX 327 and SWOG \n9916).\n591,736,737 TAX 327 compared docetaxel (every 3 weeks or weekly) \nplus prednisone to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in 1006 patients.736 \nEvery -3-week docetaxel resulted in higher median OS than mitoxantrone \n(18.9 vs. 16.5 months; P  = .009). This survival benefit was maintained at \nextended follow -up.737 The SWOG 9916 study also showed improved \nsurvival with docetaxel when combined with estramustine compared to mitoxantrone plus prednisone.\n591  \nDocetaxel is FDA -approved for metastatic CRPC. The standard regimen is \nevery 3 weeks. An alternative to every -3-week docetaxel is a biweekly \nregimen of 50 mg/m2. This regimen is based on a large randomized phase \n2 trial of 346 patients with metastatic CRPC randomized to either every -2-\nweek docetaxel or every -3-week docetaxel, each with maintenance of \nADT and prednisone.738 Patients treated with the every -2-week regimen \nsurvived an average of 19.5 months compared to 17.0 months with the \nevery -3-week regimen ( P = .015). Time to progression and PSA decline \nrate favored every -2-week therapy. Tolerability was improved with every -\n2-week docetaxel; febrile neutropenia rate was 4% versus 14% and other \ntoxicities and overall QOL were similar.  \nTreatment with greater than or equal to 8 cycles of docetaxel may be \nassociated with better OS than fewer cycles in the metastatic CRPC \nsetting, but prospective trials are necessary to test 6 versus 10 cycles of docetaxel in the metastatic castration- sensitive and CRPC settings.\n739 \nRetrospective analysis from the GETUG -AFU 15 trial suggests that \ndocetaxel only benefits some patients with CRPC who received docetaxel \nin the castration- sensitive setting.740  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-63 Thus, docetaxel is a category 1 preferred option for treatment of \ndocetaxel -naïve metastatic CRPC. The Panel believes that docetaxel can \nbe given as a rechallenge after progression on a novel hormone in the metastatic CRPC setting if given in the castration -sensitive setting.  \nNCCN panelists agreed that docetaxel rechallenge may be useful in some \npatients (category 2A instead of category 1 in this setting), especially in \nthose who have not shown definitive evidence of progression on prior \ndocetaxel therapy. Docetaxel rechallenge can be considered in patients \nwho received docetaxel with ADT in the metastatic castration- sensitive \nsetting.  \nCabazitaxel  \nIn June 2010, the FDA approved cabazitaxel, a semi -synthetic taxane \nderivative, for patients with metastatic CRPC previously treated with a \ndocetaxel -containing regimen. An international randomized phase 3 trial \n(TROPIC) randomized 755 patients with progress ive metastatic CRPC to \nreceive cabazitaxel 25 mg/m\n2 or mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2, each with daily \nprednisone.741 A 2.4 -month improvement in OS was demonstrated with \ncabazitaxel compared to mitoxantrone (HR, 0.72; P < .0001). The \nimprovement in survival was balanced against a higher toxic death rate \nwith cabazitaxel (4.9% vs. 1.9%), which was due, in large part, to \ndifferences in rates of sepsis and renal failure. Febrile neutropenia was \nobserved in 7.5% of cabazitax el-treated patients versus 1.3% of \nmitoxantrone -treated patients. The incidences of severe diarrhea (6%), \nfatigue (5%), nausea/vomiting (2%), anemia (11%), and thrombocytopenia \n(4%) also were higher in cabazitaxel -treated patients, which indicated the \nneed for vigilance and treatment or prophylaxis in this setting to prevent \nfebrile neutropenia. The survival benefit was sustained at an updated \nanalysis with a median follow -up of 25.5 months.742 Furthermore, results of \na post -hoc analysis of this trial suggested that the occurrence of grade ≥3 neutropenia after cabazitaxel treatment was associated with \nimprovements in both PFS and OS.743 \nThe multicenter CARD study was a randomized, open- label clinical trial \nthat compared cabazitaxel with either abiraterone or enzalutamide in 255 patients with metastatic CRPC who had previously received docetaxel and \neither abiraterone or enzalutamide.\n744 Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m2 with \nconcurrent steroid improved the primary endpoint of radiographic PFS (8.0 \nvs. 3.7 months; HR, 0.54; P < .0001) and reduced the risk of death (13.6 \nvs. 11.0 months; HR, 0.64; P  = .008) compared with abiraterone or \nenzalutamide in these patients. Cabazitaxel was also associated with an \nincreased rate of pain response and delayed time to pain progression and \nSREs.745  \nThe phase 3 open- label, multinational, non -inferiority PROSELICA study \ncompared 20 mg/m2 cabazitaxel with 25 mg/m2 cabazitaxel in 1200 \npatients with metastatic CRPC who progressed on docetaxel.746 The lower \ndose was found to be noninferior to the higher dose for median OS (13.4 \nmonths [95% CI, 12.19– 14.88] vs. 14.5 months [95% CI, 13.47– 15.28]), \nand grade 3/4 adverse events were decreased (39.7% vs. 54.5%). In \nparticular, grade ≥3 neutropenia rates were 41.8% and 73.3% for the \nlower and higher dose groups, respectively.  \nResults from the phase 3 FIRSTANA study suggested that cabazitaxel has clinical activity in patients with chemotherapy -naïve mCRPC.\n747 Median \nOS, the primary endpoint, was similar between 20 mg/m2 cabazitaxel, 25 \nmg/m2 cabazitaxel, and 75 mg/m2 docetaxel (24.5 months, 25.2 months, \nand 24.3 months, respectively). Cabazitaxel was associated with lower \nrates of peripheral sensory neuropathy than docetaxel, particularly at 20 \nmg/m2 (12% vs. 25%). However, the Panel does not currently recommend \ncabazitaxel in docetaxel -naïve patients.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-64 Based on these data, cabazitaxel is included in these Guidelines as a \npreferred option after progression occurs on docetaxel in patients with \nmetastatic CRPC (category 1 after progression on docetaxel and a novel \nhormone therapy). Cabazitaxel at 20 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, with or without \ngrowth factor support, is the recommended dose for fit patients. Cabazitaxel at 25 mg/m\n2 may be considered for healthy patients who wish \nto be more aggressive.  \nCabazitaxel should be given with concurrent steroids (daily prednisone or \ndexamethasone on the day of chemotherapy). Physicians should follow \ncurrent guidelines for prophylactic white blood cell growth factor use, \nparticularly in this heavily pretreated, high -risk population. In addition, \nsupportive care should include antiemetics (prophylactic antihistamines, H2 antagonists, and corticosteroids prophylaxis) and symptom -directed \nantidiarrheal agents. Cabazitaxel was tested in patients with hepatic dysfuncti on in a small, phase I, dose- escalation study.\n748 Cabazitaxel was \ntolerated in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. However, cabazitaxel should not be used in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction. \nCabazitaxel should be stopped upon clinical disease progression or \nintolerance.  \nCabazitaxel/Carboplatin \nCabazitaxel 20 mg/m² plus carboplatin AUC 4 mg/mL per minute with growth factor support can be considered for fit patients with aggressive \nvariant metastatic CRPC (visceral metastases, low PSA and bulky \ndisease, high lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] , high carcinoembryonic \nantigen [CEA], lytic bone metastases, and neuroendocrine prostate cancer  \n[NEPC] histology) or unfavorable genomics (defects in at least 2 of PTEN , \nTP53, and RB1 ). This recommendation is based on a phase 1– 2, open \nlabel, randomized study.\n749 In the phase 2 portion, 160 patients were \nrandomized to receive cabazitaxel alone or with carboplatin, and the \nprimary endpoint was investigator -assessed PFS. In the ITT  population, median PFS was 4.5 months in the cabazitaxel arm versus 7.3 months in the cabazitaxel/carboplatin arm (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50– 0.95; P = .018). \nThe most common grade 3–5 adverse events (fatigue, anemia, \nneutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) were all more common in the \ncombination arm. Post -hoc analyses showed that patients with aggressive \nvariant disease had a longer median PFS in the combination arm than the \ncabazitaxel arm (7.5 vs. 1.7 months; P = .017). Patients without \naggressive variant tumors, on the other hand, had similar median PFS regardless of treatment (6.5 vs. 6.3 months; P  = .38).  \nSipuleucel -T \nIn April 2010, sipuleucel- T became the first in a new class of cancer \nimmunotherapeutic agents to be approved by the FDA. This autologous \ncancer “vaccine” involves collection of the white blood cell fraction-\ncontaining, antigen- presenting cells from each patient; exposure of the \ncells to the prostatic acid phosphatase- granulocyte macrophage colony -\nstimulating factor (PAP -GM-CSF recombinant fusion protein); and \nsubsequent reinfusion of the cells. The pivotal study was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind trial (D9902B).\n750 Five hundred \ntwelve patients with minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic metastatic \nCRPC were randomized 2:1 to receive sipuleucel -T or placebo. Eighteen-\npoint  two percent of patients had received prior chemotherapy, which \nincluded docetaxel; eligibility requirements included no chemotherapy for 3 \nmonths and no steroids for 1 month prior to enrollment. Median survival in \nthe vaccine arm was 25.8 months compared to 21.7 months in the control \narm. In a subset analysis, both those who did and those who did not  \nreceive prior chemotherapy benefited from sipuleucel -T treatment. \nSipuleucel -T treatment resulted in a 22% reduction in mortality risk (HR, \n0.78; 95% CI, 0.61– 0.98; P = .03). Common complications included mild \nto moderate chills (54.1%), pyrexia (29.3%), and headache (16.0%), which \nusually were transient.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-65 A prospective registry of patients with metastatic CRPC, PROCEED, \nenrolled 1976 patients from 2011 to 2017, who were followed for a median \nof 46.6 months.751 The safety and tolerability of sipuleucel -T were \nconsistent with previous findings, and the median OS was 30.7 months \n(95% CI, 28.6– 32.2 months).  \nSipuleucel -T is a category 1 option for certain patients with metastatic \nCRPC who have not had previous treatment with docetaxel or with a novel \nhormone therapy. Benefit of sipuleucel -T has not been reported in patients \nwith visceral metastases and is not recommended  if visceral metastases \nare present. Sipuleucel -T is also not recommended for patients with small \ncell prostate cancer /NEPC . The Panel prefers that sipuleucel -T be used as \na therapy for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with \nmetastatic CRPC, so that disease burden is lower and immune function is \npotentially more intact. However, it is also an option for patients with \nmetastatic CRPC who have had prior treatment with docetaxel or a novel \nhormone therapy, but not for patients who have already received both. \nPatients should have good performance level (ECOG 0- 1), estimated life \nexpectancy greater than 6 months, and no liver metastases. Clinicians and patients should be aware that the usual markers of benefit (decline in PSA \nand improvement in bone or CT scans) are not seen. Therefore, benefit to \nthe individual patient cannot be ascertained using currently available \ntesting.  \nTreatment after sipuleucel -T treatment should proceed as clinically \nindicated, particularly if symptoms develop.  \nPembrolizumab  \nThe FDA approved the use of pembrolizumab, an anti -PD1 antibody, for \ntreatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI -H or dMMR solid \ntumors who have progressed on prior treatment and who have no \nsatisfactory alternative treatment options in May 2017. This approval was based on the treatment of 149 patients across five clinical studies \ninvolving MSI -H or dMMR colorectal (n = 90) or non- colorectal (n = 59) \ncancer for an objective response rate of 40% (59/149).\n719 All patients \nreceived greater than or equal to 1 prior regimen. Among the non -\ncolorectal cohorts, two patients had metastatic CRPC: one achieved a \npartial objective response, and the other achieved stable disease for \ngreater than 9 months.  \nOutcomes of additional patients with metastatic CRPC treated with \npembrolizumab have been reported.72,752- 756 In an early study, 10 patients \nwith CRPC and non- visceral metastases (bone = 7; lymph nodes = 2; \nbone and liver = 1) who had disease progression on enzalutamide were \ntreated with pembrolizumab and enzalutamide.752 Some of the patients \nalso had experienced disease progression on additional therapies \n(docetaxel for castration- sensitive disease, abiraterone, and/or sipuleucel -\nT). Three of the 10 patients showed a near complete PSA response. Two \nof these three patients  had radiographically measurable disease and \nachieved a partial radiographic response (including a response in liver metastases). Of the remaining patients, three showed stable disease, and \nfour displayed no evidence of clinical benefit. Genetic analysis o f biopsy \ntissue revealed that one patient whose disease showed PSA response had an MSI -H tumor, whereas the other patient with responsive disease \nand two with non- responsive disease did not. The nonrandomized phase \nIb KEYNOTE- 028 trial included 23 patients  with advanced, progressive \nprostate cancer, of whom 74% had received greater than or equal to two previous therapies for metastatic disease.\n754 The objective response rate \nby investigator review was 17.4% (95% CI, 5.0% –38.8%), with four \nconfirmed partial responses. Eight patients (34.8%) had stable disease. \nTreatment -related adverse events occurred in 61% of patients after a \nmedian follow -up of 7.9 months; 17% of the cohort experienced grade 3/4 \nevents (ie, grade 4 lipase increase, grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, grade \n3 asthenia, grade 3 fatigue).

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-66 KEYNOTE- 199 was a multi -cohort, open- label phase II study in 258 \npatients with metastatic CRPC and prior treatment with docetaxel and at \nleast one novel hormonal therapy that assessed pembrolizumab in \npatients regardless of MSI status.757 Cohorts 1 and 2 included patients with \nPD-L1–positive (n = 133) and PD -L1–negative (n = 66) prostate cancer, \nrespectively. Cohort 3 included those with bone -predominant disease with \npositive or negative PD -L1 expression (n = 59). The primary endpoint of \noverall response rate ( ORR ) was 5% (95% CI, 2% –11%) in cohort 1 and \n3% (95% CI, <1% –11%) in cohort 2. Responses were durable (range, 1.9 \n– ≥21.8 months).  \nThe most common adverse events from pembrolizumab are fatigue, \npruritus, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, nausea, rash, fever, cough, \ndyspnea, and musculoskeletal pain. Pembrolizumab also may be \nassociated with immune- mediated side effects, which include colitis, \nhepatitis, endocrinopathies, pneumonitis, or nephritis.  \nBased on the available data, the Panel supports the use of pembrolizumab \nin patients with MSI -H or dMMR metastatic CRPC whose disease has \nprogressed through docetaxel and a novel hormone therapy. The prevalence of MMR deficiency in metastatic CPRC is estim ated at 2% to \n5%,\n36,753 and testing for MSI -H or dMMR can be performed using DNA \ntesting or immunohistochemistry. If tumor MSI -H or dMMR is identified, the \nPanel recommends referral to genetic counseling for consideration of \ngermline testing for Lynch syndrome.  \nIn June 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval for pembrolizumab’s use in patients with unresectable or metastatic TMB -high (TMB -H) [≥10 \nmutations/megabase (mut/Mb)] solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative \ntreatment options. Results from prospective biomarker analysis of the \nmulticohort, non- randomized, open -label, phase 2 KEYNOTE -158 trial \nsupport this approval.\n758 The prospective TMB study included an efficacy population of 790 patients with anal, biliary, cervical, endometrial, \nmesothelioma, neuroendocrine, salivary, small  cell lung, thyroid, or vulvar \ncancer who were evaluable for TMB. Of these, 102 patients (13%) had \nTMB -H status. Objective responses to pembrolizumab were seen in 30 of \n102 patients in the TMB -H group (29%; 95% CI, 21% –39%) and 43 of 688 \npatients in the non– TMB -H group (6%; 95% CI, 5% –8%). Safety was as \nexpected based on other studies of pembroliz umab. Even though there \nwere no patients with prostate cancer in the TMB pembrolizumab study, \nthe Panel includes pembrolizumab as an option for patients with \nmetastatic CRPC, prior docetaxel and novel hormone therapy, and TMB \n≥10 mut/Mb based on extrapolation from other tumor types.  \nMitoxantrone  \nTwo randomized trials assessed the role of mitoxantrone in patients with metastatic CRPC.\n759,760 Although there was no improvement in OS, \npalliative responses and improvements in QOL were seen with \nmitoxantrone.  \nMitoxantrone can be used for palliation in symptomatic patients with \nmetastatic CRPC who cannot tolerate other therapies after disease \nprogression on prior docetaxel . \nTreatment Options for Patients with DNA Repair Gene Mutations  \nEarly studies suggest germline and somatic mutations in HRR genes (eg, \nBRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D, CHEK2 ) may be \npredictive of the clinical benefit of poly -ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) \ninhibitors.761- 763 PARP inhibitors are oral agents that exert their activity \nthrough the concept of synthetic lethality.764 PARP inhibitor therapy options \nare discussed below.  \nDNA repair defects have also been reported to be predictive for sensitivity \nto platinum agents in CRPC and other cancers.765- 769 Platinum agents have PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-67 shown some activity in patients with CRPC without molecular selection.770 \nStudies of platinum agents in patients with CRPC that have DNA repair \ngene mutations are needed.  \nIn addition, results of one study suggested that patients with metastatic CRPC and germline mutations in DNA repair genes may have better \noutcomes if treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide than with taxanes.\n44 \nHowever, it should be noted that the response of patients with metastatic \nCRPC and HRR gene mutations to standard therapies is similar to the \nresponse of patients without mutations.771,772 \nPatients with CDK12  mutations tend to have aggressive disease,  with high \nrates of metastases and short OS. Their disease also does not respond \nwell to hormonal therapy, PARP inhibitors, or taxanes. Two large, multi -\ninstitutional, retrospective studies have shown that 11% to 33% of patients with metastatic CRPC and CDK12  mutations experienced disease \nresponse to PD -1 inhibitors (ie, nivolumab, pembrolizumab), some with \ndurable responses.\n773,774 The Panel awaits more data on the use of PD -1 \ninhibition in patients with CDK12  mutations.  \nOlaparib  \nPreliminary clinical data using olaparib suggested favorable activity of this \nagent in patients with HRR gene mutations, but not in those without HRR \nmutations.762,763,775 The phase 3 PROfound study was a randomized trial \nevaluating olaparib 300 mg twice daily versus physician’s choice of \nabiraterone or enzalutamide in patients with metastatic CRPC and \nprogression on at least one novel hormonal agent (abiraterone or \nenzalut amide) and up to one prior taxane agent (permitted but not \nrequired).776 Patients were required to have a somatic or germline HRR \ngene mutation, and were allocated to one of two cohorts: cohort A \ncomprised patients with BRCA1/2  or ATM  mutations, and cohort B \ncomprised patients with a mutation in at least one of 12 other HRR genes (BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L ). The primary endpoint of \nimproving radiographic PFS with olaparib versus abiraterone/enzalutamide was met in cohort A (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25– 0.47; P < .001),  and \nradiographic PFS was also superior in the entire study population encompassing cohorts A+B (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38– 0.63; P < .001).  \nIn addition, final OS analysis of PROfound showed that OS was improved with olaparib versus abiraterone/enzalutamide in cohort A (HR, 0.69; 95% \nCI, 0.50 –0.97; P = .02), despite the fact that 86 of 131 patients (66%) \ncrossed over to olaparib after disease progression in the control arm.\n777 \nThe Panel notes that there may be heterogeneity of response to olaparib \nbased on which gene has a mutation. Efficacy in PROfound appears to be \ndriven by the cohort of patients with at least one alteration in BRCA2 , \nBRCA1 , or ATM , and in particular by patients with BRCA2  or BRCA1  \nmutations based on exploratory gene -by-gene analysis.777 Patients with \nBRCA2  mutations in PROfound experienced an OS benefit with olaparib \n(HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37 –0.95), whereas the HR for OS in patients with \nATM  mutations was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.53– 1.75).777 Furthermore, there were \nfew patients in PROfound with mutations in some of the genes. For example, only 4 patients had BRIP1 mutations (2 in olaparib arm and 2 in \ncontrol arm), 2 patients had RAD51D mutations (both in olaparib arm), and \nno patients had RAD51C mutations.\n776 Patients with PPP2R2A mutations \nin PROfound experienced an unfavorable risk -benefit profile.  \nAs a result of the favorable efficacy data from the PROfound trial, the FDA \napproved olaparib (300 mg twice daily) in May 2020 for use in patients \nwith metastatic CRPC and deleterious or suspected deleterious germline \nor somatic HRR gene mutations in at least one of 14 genes ( BRCA1, \nBRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, \nRAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L ) and who had previously \nreceived treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-68 Since prior taxane therapy was not mandated in the PROfound study, \nolaparib use might be reasonable in metastatic CRPC patients before or \nafter docetaxel treatment. Adverse events that may occur with olaparib \ntreatment include anemia (including that requir ing transfusion), fatigue, \nnausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, creatinine elevation, cough, and dyspnea. Rare but serious side effects \nmay include thromboembolic events (including pulmonary emboli), drug -\ninduced pneumonit is, and a theoretical risk of myelodysplasia or acute \nmyeloid leukemia.\n776  \nThe Panel recommends olaparib as an option for patients with metastatic CRPC, previous androgen receptor -directed therapy, and an HRRm \nregardless of prior docetaxel therapy  (category 1). The HRR genes to be \nconsidered for use of olaparib are BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, \nCDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D \nand RAD54L .  \nAny commercially available analytically and clinically validated somatic tumor and ctDNA assays and germline assays can be used to identify \npatients for treatment. Careful monitoring of complete blood counts and \nhepatic and renal function, along with type and screens and potential \ntransfusion support and/or dose reductions as needed for severe anemia \nor intolerance are recommended during olaparib therapy.  \nRucaparib  \nRucaparib is another PARP inhibitor approved for use in patients with metastatic CRPC. This agent received accelerated FDA approval in May \n2020 based on the preliminary favorable data from the TRITON2 clinical \ntrial. In that open -label , single -arm, phase 2 trial, patients with m etastatic \nCRPC harboring a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutation, who had previously received therapy \nwith a novel hormonal agent plus one taxane chemotherapy, were treated \nwith rucaparib 600 mg twice daily.\n778 The primary endpoint of TRITON2 was the objective response rate in patients with measurable disease, and \nwas 43.5% (95% CI, 31.0% –56.7%) in this BRCA1/2 -mutated population. \nMedian radiographic PFS, a key secondary endpoint, was 9.0 months \n(95% CI, 8.3– 13.5 months). The most common adverse events were \nasthenia/fatigue, nausea, and anemia/decreased hemoglobin, with grade ≥3 anemia/decreased hemoglobin in 25.2% of participants. Final analysis \nof TRITON2 confirmed results of the earlier analysis.\n779  \nIn the randomized phase 3 TRITON3 study, patients with m etastatic \nCRPC and a germline or somatic BRCA1/2  or ATM  mutation who have \npreviously received a novel hormonal agent but no chemotherapy for \nmCRPC were randomized 2:1 to rucaparib versus physician’s choice of \ntherapy (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or docetaxel).780 The primary endpoint \nof TRITON3, the median duration of imaging- based PFS, was significantly \nlonger at 62 months in the group of 270 participants assigned to receive rucaparib than in the 135 participants who received a control medication \n(10.2 months vs.  6.4 months; HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47– 0.80; P < .001). \nThis effect was also seen in the 201 patients and 101 patients in each group with a BRCA m (11.2 months vs. 6.4 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, \n0.36– 0.69). For those with ATM  mutations, an exploratory analysis \nsuggested a possible improvement as well (8.1 months vs. 6.8 months; \nHR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.59– 1.52). As in TRITON2, the most frequent adverse \nevents with rucaparib were fatigue and nausea.  \nThe Panel recommends rucaparib as an option for patients with metastatic CRPC, prior treatment with a novel hormone therapy, and a BRCA1 or \nBRCA2 mutation. Rucaparib should not be used in patients with HRR \ngene mutations other than BRCA1/2 .\n781 Adverse events that may occur \nwith rucaparib include anemia (including that requiring transfusion), \nfatigue, asthenia, nausea or vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea or \nconstipation, thrombocytopenia, increased creatinine, increased liver \ntransaminas es, and rash.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-69 include a theoretical risk of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia, as \nwell as fetal teratogenicity.778,781  \nThe preferred method of selecting patients for rucaparib treatment is \nsomatic analysis of BRCA1  and BRCA2  using a circulating tumor DNA \nsample. As with olaparib, careful monitoring of complete blood counts and \nhepatic and renal function, along with type and screens and potential \ntransfusion support and/or dose reductions as needed for severe anemia \nor intoler ance are recommended during treatment with rucaparib.  \nOlaparib Plus Abiraterone  \nPre-clinical data suggest that PARP -1 promotes androgen receptor \nactivity.782 Additional pre- clinical data show that androgen receptor \ninhibitors can down -regulate DNA repair genes, creating a situation similar \nto that of HRR mutation.783,784 These results suggest that the combination \nof PARP inhibition with androgen receptor inhibition may have an enhanced antitumor effect and that this effect may not be limited to \npatients with HRR mutations. In fact, a randomized phase 2 trial showed \nthat t he combination of abiraterone with olaparib increased radiographic \nPFS over abiraterone and placebo in patients with metastatic CRPC regardless of HRR status (ITT population: HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44– 0.97; P \n= .034).\n763 \nThe PROpel trial was an international, double- blind, phase 3 trial \ncomparing abiraterone and olaparib with abiraterone and placebo in 796 \npatients with metastatic CRPC regardless of HRR mutation status.785 Prior \ndocetaxel in the localized or metastatic castration- sensitive setting was \nallowed, but patients were untreated for CRPC. The primary endpoint, imaging- based PFS by investigator assessment in the ITT  population, was \nsignificantly longer in the abiraterone/olaparib group than in the \nabiraterone/placebo group (24.8 vs. 16.6 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54–\n0.81; P < .001). HRR mutations were identified in tumors of 226 patients; \n552 patients did not have HRR tumor mutations. The HR for the primary endpoint in those with HRR mutations was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.34– 0.73). The \nsafety profile of the olaparib/abiraterone combination was as expected \nbased on the known safety profiles of the individual drugs, with the most \ncommon adverse events being anemia, fatigue/asthenia, and nausea.  \nOS data from PROpel were presented at the 2023 ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.\n786 A trend towards an OS benefit with the \nabiraterone/olaparib combination was seen in the ITT population and in \nthe HRRm, non -HRRm, BRCAm, and non -BRCAm subgroups. However, \ncrossover was not allowed, so patients with HRRm in the control arm were \nunable to r eceive olaparib, likely contributing to the inferior survival in the \ncontrol group.  \nIn May 2023, the FDA approved the combination of olaparib with \nabiraterone for the treatment of adult patients with BRCAm metastatic \nCRPC. Based on the results of PROpel, olaparib/abiraterone is included in \nthe NCCN Guidelines as an option in first -line m etastatic CRPC for \npatients with a pathogenic BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutation (germline and/or \nsomatic) who have not yet received a novel hormone therapy or docetaxel  \n(category 1) and for those who received prior docetaxel in the castration-sensitive setting (category 2A) . \nTalazoparib Plus Enzalutamide  \nTalazoparib is another PARP inhibitor; it has had an FDA indication in \nbreast cancer. The open -label, international phase 2 TALAPRO -1 trial \nincluded 127 patients with an HRR mutation and progressive, metastatic \nCRPC, all of whom received at least one dose of talazoparib.787 The \nobjective response rate after a median follow -up of 16.4 months was \n29.8% (95% CI, 21.2– 39.6). The most common grade 3– 4 treatment -\nemergent adverse events were anemia (31%), thrombocytopenia (9%), \nand neutropenia (8%).

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-70 As noted above (see Olaparib Plus Abiraterone), pre -clinical data suggest \nthat the PARP inhibition combined with  androgen receptor inhibition may \nhave an enhanced antitumor effect that may not be limited to those with \nHRR mutations. The randomized, double- blind, phase 3 TALAPRO -2 \nstudy compared enzalutamide plus talazoparib with enzalutamide plus placebo in 805 patients with untreated metastatic CRPC.\n788 HRR gene \nalteration status and treatment with docetaxel and/or abiraterone in the \ncastration- sensitive setting were used to stratify the randomization. The \nprimary endpoint was radiographic PFS in the ITT population. At the \nplanned primary analysis, median radiographic PFS was not reached \n(95% CI, 27.5 months –not reached) for the talazoparib group and was \n21.9 months (95% CI, 16.6– 25.1) for the control group (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, \n0.51– 0.78; P < .0001).  \nHRR mutations were present in 21% of TALAPRO -2 participants, with \nBRCA  alterations being  the most common.788 The HR for radiographic PFS \nin the HRR- deficient subgroup was more strongly in favor of the \ntalazoparib combination than in the HRR -proficient/unknown population \n(0.46 [95% CI, 0.30– 0.70; P = .0003] vs. 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54 –0.89; P = \n.0039]). Among HRR mutations, talazoparib conferred a 77% lower risk of \nradiographic progression or death in those with tumor mutations in BRCA1  \nor BRCA2  (HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.10– 0.53; P = .0002), whereas the \ncorresponding reduction was 34% (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.39– 1.12; P = .12) \nin those with non- BRCA  HRR alterations.  \nPrior therapy also affected the radiographic PFS outcomes in this trial.788 \nIn the 179 participants in TALAPRO -2 who had received docetaxel in \nearlier disease settings, the HR for radiographic PFS was 0.51 (95% CI, \n0.32– 0.81; P = .0034). In the small population of 50 participants in the ITT \npopulation who had received prior novel hormonal therapy, the \ncorresponding HR was non- significant at 0.57 (95% CI, 0.28– 1.16; P = \n.12). The safety profile of enzalutamide plus talazoparib was consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual drugs, with the most common \nadverse events in those who received talazoparib being anemia, \nneutropenia, and fatigue. However, hematologic adverse events were of \nhigher grades and occurred more frequently than would be expected with \ntalazoparib alone. Overall, the combination had significant toxicity, with \ndose interruption due to adverse events in 75% of participants in the \ntalazoparib group c ompared with 23% in the placebo group. Dose \nreductions due to adverse events occurred in 56% and 7% of the talazoparib and placebo groups, respectively.  \nBased on these results, the FDA approved talazoparib plus enzalutamide for HRRm metastatic CRPC in June 2023. The Panel includes talazoparib \nplus enzalutamide as a treatment option for patients with metastatic CRPC \nand a pathogenic mutation (germline and/or somatic) in one of certain \nHRR and other DNA repair genes ( BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, ATR, CDK12, \nCHEK2, FANCA, MLH1, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2 , or RAD51C) who have \nnot yet had treatment in the setting of CRPC. This is a category 1 \nrecommendation for those without prior docetaxel or prior novel hormone \ntherapy. It is a category 2A recommendation for those with prior docetaxel \nin the castration- sensitive setting and no prior novel hormone therapy. Use \nof talazoparib/enzalutamide for those who have received prior novel hormone therapy without prior docetaxel is controversial (category 2B) \nbecause a benefit of this combination over use of a PARP inhibitor alone \nhas not been shown in this setting, but responses are likely.  \nNiraparib Plus Abiraterone  \nAnother PARP inhibitor, niraparib, has also been studied in combination \nwith androgen inhibition in the setting of metastatic CRPC.

After a \nmedian follow -up of 18.6 months, radiographic PFS was improved for \nthose receiving niraparib in the HRRm group overall (16.5 months vs . 13.7 \nmonths; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56– 0.96; P = .022) as well as in the BRCAm \nsubgroup (16.6 months vs . 10.9 months; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36– 0.79; P \n= .001). However, radiographic PFS was not improved in the subgroup of \npatients with non- BRCA  HRR mutations (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68– 1.44). \nFor the cohort without HRR mutations, futility was declared based on prespecified criteria. The secondary endpoints of time to symptomatic \nprogression and time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy were \nimproved with the combination therapy in the HRRm and BRCAm cohorts.  \nA second interim analysis of MAGNITUDE included a prespecified, inverse probability censoring weighting analysis of OS, which was designed to \naccount for the receipt of subsequent therapies, including PARP \ninhibitors.\n790 Results of this analysis suggest that there may be an OS \nbenefit for the combination therapy (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33– 0.90; nominal \nP = .0181).  \nThe incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was higher with the combination of niraparib plus abiraterone compared with placebo and \nabiraterone (67.0% vs . 46.4%).\n789 Anemia (28.3% v s. 7.6%) and \nhypertension (14.6% v s. 12.3%) were the most reported grade ≥3 adverse \nevents. Overall, the combination was tolerable and QOL  was maintained.  \nBased on these results, the FDA approved niraparib plus abiraterone for \nthe treatment of patients with BRCAm metastatic CRPC in August 2023. \nThe Panel includes niraparib plus abiraterone as a treatment option for patients with metastatic CRPC and a pathogenic BRCA1  or BRCA2  \nmutation (germline and/or somatic)  who have not yet had treatment in the \nsetting of metastatic CRPC . This is a category 1 recommendation for \nthose without prior docetaxel or prior novel hormone therapy. It is a \ncategory 2A recommendation for those with prior docetaxel and no prior \nnovel hormone therapy.  Use of niraparib/abiraterone for those who have \nreceived prior novel hormone therapy without prior docetaxel is \ncontroversial (category 2B) because a benefit of this combination over use \nof a PARP inhibitor alone has not been shown in this setting, but \nresponses are likely.    \nRadiopharmaceuticals for Metastatic CRPC \nLutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan  \nLu-177-PSMA -617 is a radiopharmaceutical that is administered \nintravenously and is indicated for PSMA -positive M1 CRPC that has been \ntreated with androgen receptor pathway inhibition and taxane- based \nchemotherapy.

Approval was \nbased on clinical data from a multicenter, phase 3, randomized trial \n(ALSYMPCA) that included 921 patients with symptomatic CRPC, two or \nmore bone metastases, and no known visceral disease.792 Fifty-seven \npercent of the patients received prior docetaxel and all patients received \nbest supportive care. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 6 monthly \nradium -223 intravenous injections or placebo. Compared to placebo, radium -223 significantly improved OS (median 14.9 months vs. 11.3 \nmonths; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.058– 0.83; P < .001) and prolonged time to \nfirst SRE (median 15.6 months vs. 9.8 months). Preplanned subset analyses showed that the survival benefit of radium -223 was maintained \nregardles s of prior docetaxel use.\n793 ITT analyses from ALSYMPCA \nshowed that radium -223 also may reduce the risk of symptomatic SREs.794 \nGrade  3/4 hematologic toxicity was low (3% neutropenia, 6% \nthrombocytopenia, and 13% anemia), likely due to the short range of \nradioactivity.792 Fecal elimination of the agent led to generally mild non-\nhematologic side effects, which included nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. \nRadium -223 was associated with improved or slower decline of QOL in \nALSYMPCA.795 \nThe multicenter, international, double- blind, placebo- controlled, phase 3 \nERA 223 trial randomized patients with bone- metastatic chemotherapy -\nnaïve CRPC to abiraterone with or without radium -223.796 The patients \nwere asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The primary endpoint of \nsymptomatic skeletal event -free survival in the ITT  population was not \nmet. In fact, the addition of radium -223 to abiraterone was associated with \nan increased frequency of bone fractures compared with placebo. The PEACE III trial (NCT02194842) is also comparing radium -223 in \ncombination with a secondary hormonal therapy to secondary hormone therapy alone in patients with mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC. In this \ntrial, the use of bone -protecting agents (denosumab or zoledronic acid) \nwas made mandatory following results from ERA 223. The cumulative incidence of fractures at 1.5 years in patients who received a bone -\nprotecting agent was 2.8% in participants receiving radium -223 plus \nenzalutamide and 3.9% in those receiving enzalutamide alone.\n797 In the \nabsence of bone agents, these numbers were 45.9% and 22.3%, \nrespectively. This result suggests that radium -223 combined with a \nsecondary hormone therapy may be safe if preventive administration of a bone agent is used.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-73 recommending radium -223 in combination with a secondary hormonal \ntherapy.  \nRadium -223 is a category 1 option to treat symptomatic bone metastases \nwithout visceral metastases.  Hematologic evaluation should be performed \naccording to the FDA label before treatment initiation and before each \nsubsequent dose.719 Radium -223 given in combination with chemotherapy \n(such as docetaxel) outside of a clinical trial has the potential for additive \nmyelosuppression.719 It is not recommended for use in combination with \ndocetaxel or any other systemic therapy except ADT. It should not be used in patients with visceral metastases. Based on the PEACE III results \ndescribed above, all patients receiving radium -223 should be given \nconcomitant denosumab or zoledronic acid.  \nSmall Cell/Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer \nDe novo small cell carcinoma in untreated prostate cancer occurs rarely \nand is very aggressive.798 Treatment -associated small cell  prostate \ncancer /NEPC  that occurs in patients with metastatic CRPC is more \ncommon.799 In a multi -institution prospective series of 202 consecutive \npatients with metastatic CRPC, all of whom underwent metastatic \nbiopsies, small cell/neuroendocrine histology was present in 17%  of \npatients .799 Patients with small cell/neuroendocrine tumors and prior \nabiraterone and/or enzalutamide had a shorter OS when compared with those with adenocarcinoma and prior abiraterone and/or enzalutamide \n(HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.07 –3.82). Genomic analysis showed that DN A repair \nmutations and small cell/neuroendocrine histology were almost mutually \nexclusive.  \nSmall cell/neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate should be considered \nin patients with disease that no longer responds to ADT and who test \npositive for metastases. These relatively rare tumors are associated with \nlow PSA levels despite large metastatic burden and visceral disease.\n800 Those with initial Grade Group 5 are especially at risk. Biopsy of \naccessible metastatic lesions to identify patients with small \ncell/neuroendocrine histomorphologic features is recommended in patients \nwith metastatic CRPC.  \nThese patients may be treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy (ie, cisplatin/etoposide, carboplatin/etoposide, docetaxel/carboplatin, \ncabazitaxel/carboplatin).\n749,801,802 Physicians should consult t he NCCN \nGuidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer for additional options in the first and \nsubsequent lines of therapy (available at www.NCCN.org ), because the \nbehavior of small cell/neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate is similar to that of small cell carcinoma of the lung.  \nAdditional Treatment Options for Bone Metastases  \nIn a multicenter study, 643 patients with CRPC and asymptomatic or \nminimally symptomatic bone metastases were randomized to intravenous \nzoledronic acid every 3 weeks or placebo.803 At 15 months, fewer patients \nin the zoledronic acid 4 -mg group than patients in the placebo group had \nSREs (33% vs. 44%; P  = .02). An update at 24 months also revealed an \nincrease in the median time to first SRE (488 days vs. 321 days; P = \n.01).804 No significant differences were found in OS. Other \nbisphosphonates have not been shown to be effective for prevention of \ndisease- related skeletal complications. Earlier use of zoledronic acid in \npatients with castration- sensitive prostate cancer  and bone metastases is \nnot associated with lower risk for SREs, and in general should not be used for SRE prevention until the development of metastatic CRPC.\n805 \nThe randomized TRAPEZE trial used a 2 X 2 factorial design to compare \nclinical PFS (pain progression, SREs, or death) as the primary outcome in \n757 patients with bone metastatic CRPC treated with docetaxel alone or \nwith zoledronic acid, 89Sr, or both.806 The bone -directed therapies had no \nstatistically significant effect on the primary outcome or on OS in PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 6:01:28 PM.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-74 unadjusted analysis. However, adjusted analysis revealed a small effect \nfor 89Sr on clinical PFS (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73– 0.99; P = .03). For \nsecondary outcomes, zoledronic acid improved the SRE -free interval (HR, \n0.78; 95% CI, 0.65– 0.95; P = .01) and decreased the total SREs (424 vs. \n605) compared with docetaxel alone.  \nDenosumab was compared to zoledronic acid in a randomized, double-\nblind, placebo- controlled study in patients with CRPC.807 The absolute \nincidence of SREs was similar in the two groups; however, the median time to first SRE was delayed by 3.6 months by denosumab compared to \nzoledronic acid (20.7 vs. 17.1 months; P  = .0002 for non -inferiority, P = \n.008 for superiority). The rates of important SREs with denosumab were \nsimilar to zoledronic acid and included spinal cord compression (3% vs. \n4%), need for radiation (19% vs. 21%), and pathologic fracture (14% vs. \n15%).  \nTreatment -related toxicities reported for zoledronic acid and denosumab \nwere similar and included hypocalcemia (more common with denosumab \n13% vs. 6%), arthralgias, and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ, 1% –2% \nincidence). Most, but not all, patients who develo p ONJ have preexisting \ndental problems.\n808 \nTherefore, denosumab every 4 weeks (category 1, preferred) or zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended for patients with CRPC and bone \nmetastases to prevent or delay disease- associated SREs. SREs include \npathologic fractures, spinal cord compressi on, operation, or EBRT to \nbone. The optimal duration of zoledronic acid or denosumab in patients \nwith CRPC and bone metastases remains unclear. A multi -institutional, \nopen- label, randomized trial in 1822 patients with bone- metastatic prostate \ncancer, breas t cancer, or multiple myeloma found that zoledronic acid \nevery 12 weeks was non -inferior to zoledronic acid every 4 weeks.\n809 In \nthe every -12-weeks and every -4-weeks arms, 28.6% and 29.5% \nexperienced at least 1 SRE within 2 years of randomization, respectively.  Oral hygiene, baseline dental evaluation for high- risk individuals, and \navoidance of invasive dental surgery during therapy are recommended to reduce the risk of ONJ.\n810 If invasive dental surgery is necessary, therapy \nshould be deferred until the dentist confirms that the patient has healed \ncompletely from the dental procedure. Supplemental calcium and vitamin \nD are recommended to prevent hypocalcemia in patients receivi ng either \ndenosumab or zoledronic acid.  \nMonitoring of creatinine clearance is required to guide dosing of zoledronic \nacid. Zoledronic acid should be dose reduced in patients with impaired \nrenal function (estimated creatinine clearance 30 –60 mL/min ) and  held for \ncreatinine clearance <30 mL/min. Denosumab may be administered to \npatients with impaired renal function or even patients on hemodialysis; \nhowever, the risk for severe hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia is \ngreater, and the dose, schedule, and safet y of denosumab have not yet \nbeen defined. A single study of 55 patients with creatinine clearance <30 \nmL/min or on hemodialysis evaluated the use of 60- mg-dose \ndenosumab.719 Hypocalcemia should be corrected before starting \ndenosumab, and serum calcium monitoring is required for denosumab and recommended for zoledronic acid, with repletion as needed.  \nRadium -223 is a category 1 option to treat symptomatic bone metastases \nwithout visceral metastases. The use of palliative, systemic radiation with \neither 89Sr or 153Sm with or without focal EBRT remains an option, \nthough they are seldom used these days wit h other available options (see \nRadium -223, above). EBRT alone is also an option.  \nClinical research on the prevention or delay of disease spread to bone \ncontinues. A phase 3 randomized trial of 1432 patients with non -metastatic \nCRPC at high risk of bone involvement showed that denosumab delayed bone metastasis by 4 months compared to pl acebo.\n811 OS was not \nimproved, and the FDA did not approve denosumab for the prevention of \nbone metastases.

NCCN Guidelines Version  2.2025 \nProstate Cancer  \n \nMS-75 Considerations for Visceral Metastases \nThe panel defines visceral metastases as those occurring in the liver, lung, \nadrenal gland, peritoneum, or brain. Soft tissue/lymph node sites are not \nconsidered visceral metastases. In general, there are fewer  data on \ntreatment of patients with CRPC and visceral metastases than for those without visceral metastases. This is especially true in patients who have \nalready received docetaxel and a novel hormone therapy, where most \nsystemic therapies are given a category 2B recommendation.  \nSequencing of Therapy in CRPC \nThe number of treatment options for patients with CRPC has expanded rapidly over the past several years. Although the optimal sequence of \ntherapies remains undefined, some data are  emerging that can help with \ntreatment selection in some cases.  \nAfter abiraterone or enzalutamide, data suggest that giving the alternate \nnovel hormone therapy may not be the optimal strategy considering the \navailability of other treatment options, including chemotherapy. The CARD \ntrial, for instance, showed that treat ment with cabazitaxel significantly \nimproved clinical outcomes over enzalutamide or abiraterone in patients with metastatic CRPC who had been previously treated with docetaxel and \nthe alternate hormonal therapy (abiraterone or enzalutamide).\n744 \nFurthermore, data suggest cross -resistance between abiraterone and \nenzalutamide.812- 815 Results of a randomized, open- label, phase 2, \ncrossover trial suggest that the sequence of abiraterone followed by enzalutamide is more efficacious than the reverse.\n816 \nSome data inform the sequencing of therapies in patients with actionable \nbiomarkers. The multicenter, unblinded, randomized phase 2 TheraP trial \ncompared PSA response after Lu- 177-PSMA- 617 vs. cabazitaxel in 200 \npatients with PSMA -positive metastatic CRPC who previously received \ndocetaxel.817 Prior androgen receptor -directed therapy was permitted. Among the ITT population, the PSA response rate was 66% in the Lu -177-\nPSMA- 617 arm compared with 37% in the cabazitaxel arm (difference \n29%; 95% CI, 16– 42; P < .0001). These numbers were 66% and 44%, \nrespectively , in those who received treatment (difference 23%; 95% CI, 9–\n37; P = .0016). Furthermore, grade 3– 4 adverse events were less frequent \nin the Lu -177-PSMA -617 arm than in the cabazitaxel arm (33% vs. 53%).  \nResults from the phase 3 PSMAfore trial (NCT04689828), which may inform the choice between Lu- 177-PSMA- 617 and switching to a different \nandrogen receptor -directed therapy in docetaxel -naïve patients, are \nawaited. Data for patients with HRRm metastatic CRPC are more limited, \nbut comparative effectiveness research suggests that olaparib may result \nin superior radiographic PFS than cabazitaxel in patients  with BRCA1  or \nBRCA2  mutations and prior treatment with docetaxel.\n818 \nNo chemotherapy regimen has demonstrated improved survival or QOL \nafter cabazitaxel or cabazitaxel/carboplatin, although several systemic \nagents other than mitoxantrone have shown palliative and radiographic \nresponse benefits in clinical trials (ie, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, \ndoxorubicin, vinorelbine, carboplatin/etoposide, docetaxel/carboplatin, \ngemcitabine/oxaliplatin, paclitaxel/carboplatin819- 828). No survival benefit for \nthese combination regimens over sequential single- agent regimens has \nbeen demonstrated, and toxicity is higher. Treatment with these regimens \ncould be considered after an informed discussion between the physician \nand an individual patient about treatment goals and risks/side effects and \nalternatives, which must include best supportive care. Prednisone or \ndexamethasone at low doses may provide palliative benefits in the \nchemotherapy -refractory setting.829 Participation in a clinical trial is \nencouraged.  \nSummary  \nThe intention of these guidelines  is to provide a framework on which to \nbase treatment decisions.
