Stelljes M, et al. Lancet Haematol 2024;11:e324-e335.\n• Footnote removed: Reinduction therapy may be appropriate in certain circumstances, such as in patients with long first remission (there are no \ndata regarding re-induction with dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin). This strategy primarily applies to cytotoxic \nchemotherapy and excludes the re-use of targeted agents due to the potential development of resistance. Targeted therapies may be retried if agents \nwere not administered continuously and not stopped due to development of clinical resistance. If a second CR is achieved, then consolidation with \nallogeneic HCT should be considered.\nAML-9 (previously AML-J 1 OF 2)\n• Therapy For Relapsed/Refractory Disease\n\u0017Targeted therapy: Therapy for AML with lysine methyltransferase 2A gene (KMT2A) rearrangement, revumenib added\n• Intensive Aggressive  therapy for appropriate patients\n\u00173rd regimen modified: Fludarabine + cytarabine + G-CSF ± idarubicin ± venetoclax\n\u00176th regimen added: CLIA (cladribine + idarubicin + cytarabine) + venetoclax (category 2B)\n• Less intensive  aggressive  therapy\n• Footnote t added: Patients whose disease has progressed to AML from MDS after significant exposure to HMAs (ie, azacitidine, decitabine) may be \nless likely to derive benefit from continued treatment with HMAs compared to patients who are HMA-naïve. Alternative treatment strategies should be \nconsidered. DiNardo CD, et al.

Other genetic lesions may \nhave therapeutic significance. The field of genomics in myeloid malignancies and related implications in AML are evolving rapidly. Mutations should be tested in all \npatients. Multiplex gene panels and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis are recommended for the ongoing management of AML in various phases of \ntreatment. (Papaemmanuil E, et al. N Engl J Med 2016;374:2209-2221; Lindsley RC, et al. Blood 2015;125:1367-1376; Dohner H, et al. Blood 2022;140:1345-1377) \n(Discussion ). If a test is not available at your institution, consult the pathology team (prior to performing the BM evaluation) about preserving material from the original \ndiagnostic sample for future testing at an outside reference lab. Peripheral blood may alternatively be used to detect molecular abnormalities in patients with disease \nwith morphologically detectable, circulating leukemic blasts. \nb A heritable hematologic malignancy predisposition syndrome may account for cytopenias with or without MDS in some patients, whether presenting to pediatric or \nadult care centers (eg, GATA2 deficiency syndrome, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, telomere biology disorders). Functional laboratory studies and constitutional \n(germline) genetic testing using large NGS panels to include genes listed on MDS-E in the NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes , whole exome or whole \ngenome sequencing complemented within silico copy number variant (CNV) calling, and/or laboratory analysis for CNVs, such as microarray testing, is recommended \nfor certain patients. See Genetic Familial High-Risk Assessment: Hereditary Myeloid Malignancy Predisposition Syndromes (MDS-D) and Gene Mutations Associated \nwith Hereditary Myeloid Malignancy Predisposition Syndromes (MDS-E) in the NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes . \nc Consider administration of one dose of intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine, or a combination of these agents) at time of diagnostic LP . See \nEvaluation and Treatment of CNS Leukemia (AML-B) . \nd At the moment, there are discrepancies between two recognized classification systems (Khoury JD, et al. Leukemia 2022;36:1703-1719; Arber DA, et al. Blood \n2022;140:1200-1228) for AML. The NCCN Guidelines do not advocate for one over another. Providers should exercise their best clinical judgment related to these \ndiscrepancies, and the NCCN Panel recommends classification systems be written to allow for maximal clinical trial participation.\ne When presented with rare cases such as acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (ALAL), including mixed phenotype acute leukemias (MP AL) (according to 2022 WHO \nclassification), consultation with an experienced hematopathologist is strongly recommended.\nf Patients with AML should preferably be cared for at experienced leukemia centers where clinical trials may be more available. Young adults may be eligible for pediatric \ntrials.\ng ATRA should be available in all community hospitals, so appropriate therapy can be started promptly.FOOTNOTES FOR EVALUATION FOR AML\nEVAL-2AREFERENCES FOR EVALUATION FOR AML\n1 Arber DA, Vardiman JW, Brunning RD, et al.

In patients receiving the ATRA/arsenic regimen, \nconsider earlier sampling at 3–4 months during consolidation. Prior practice guidelines have recommended monitoring blood by PCR every 3 mo for 2 y to detect \nmolecular relapse. We continue to endorse this for patients with high-risk disease, those >60 y of age or who had long interruptions during consolidation, or patients \non regimens that use maintenance and are not able to tolerate maintenance. Clinical experience indicates that risk of relapse in patients with low-risk disease who are \nin molecular remission at completion of consolidation is low and monitoring may not be necessary outside the setting of a clinical trial. While long-term monitoring has \nbeen standard, with newer, more effective regimens, the value is less certain.\nn To confirm PCR positivity, a second blood sample should be done in 2–4 weeks in a reliable laboratory. If molecular relapse is confirmed by a second positive test, \ntreat as first relapse (APL-6). If the second test is negative, frequent monitoring (every 3 mo for 2 y) is strongly recommended to confirm that the test remains negative. \nThe PCR testing lab should indicate the level of sensitivity of assay for positivity (most clinical labs have a sensitivity level of 10-4), and testing should be done in the \nsame lab to maintain the same level of sensitivity.

Monitor daily until coagulopathy \nresolves.\n\u0017Avoid use of tunneled catheter or port-a-cath.\n• Leukapheresis1 is not routinely recommended in patients with a high WBC count in APL because of the difference in leukemia biology; however, in \nlife-threatening cases with leukostasis that is not responsive to other modalities, leukapheresis can be considered with caution.\n• Hydroxyurea can be used to treat leukocytosis in individuals with low-risk disease who experience a rise in WBC count after treatment with an \nATRA/arsenic trioxide based regimen.\n• APL differentiation syndrome:\n\u0017Maintain a high index of suspicion of APL differentiation syndrome (ie, fever, often associated with increasing WBC count >10 x 109/L, usually \nat initial diagnosis or relapse; shortness of breath; hypoxemia; pleural or pericardial effusions).2 Close monitoring of volume overload and \npulmonary status is indicated. Initiate dexamethasone at first signs or symptoms of respiratory compromise (ie, hypoxemia, pulmonary infiltrates, \npericardial or pleural effusions) (10 mg BID for 3–5 days with a taper over 2 weeks). Consider interrupting ATRA therapy until hypoxia resolves.\n\u0017For patients at high risk (WBC count > 10 x 109/L) for developing differentiation syndrome, initiate prophylaxis with corticosteroids, either \nprednisone 0.5 mg/kg day 1 or dexamethasone 10 mg every 12 h (NCCN Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Cancer-Related Infections ). \nTaper the steroid dose over a period of several days. If patient develops differentiation syndrome, change prednisone to dexamethasone 10 mg \nevery 12 h until count recovery or risk of differentiation has abated.2,3\n\u0017Hydroxyurea can be used to treat leukocytosis associated with differentiation syndrome. In difficult-to-treat cases, an anthracycline (daunorubicin \nor idarubicin) or gemtuzumab ozogamicin can be used. \n• Arsenic trioxide monitoring:\n\u0017Prior to initiating therapy \n ◊ECG for prolonged QTc interval assessment \n ◊Serum electrolytes (Ca, K, Mg, phosphorus) and creatinine \n\u0017During therapy (weekly during induction therapy and before each course of post-remission therapy)\n ◊Minimize use of drugs that may prolong QT interval.\n ◊Maintain K and Mg concentrations within middle or upper range of normal.\n ◊In patients with prolonged QTc interval >500 millisec, correct electrolytes and proceed with caution. QTcF is recommended; however, in settings \nwhere QTcF corrections are unavailable, a cardiology consult may be appropriate for patients with prolonged QTc.4 \n• Myeloid growth factors should not be used during induction. They may be considered during consolidation in selected cases (ie, life-threatening \ninfections, signs/symptoms of sepsis); however, there are no outcomes data regarding the prophylactic use of growth factors in consolidation. \na Antiviral prophylaxis against varicella-zoster virus for duration of treatment may \nbe appropriate.

Measures to rapidly reduce the WBC count include \nleukapheresis, hydroxyurea, and/or a single dose of cytarabine.

See Discussion .\nk For CBF-AML with FLT3-TKD mutation, the Panel prefers gemtuzumab ozogamicin over an FLT3 inhibitor.\nl Patients who receive transplant shortly following gemtuzumab ozogamicin administration may be at risk for developing sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). \nWadleigh M, et al. Blood 2003;102:1578-1582. If transplant is planned, note that prior studies have used a 60- to 90-day interval between the last administration of \ngemtuzumab ozogamicin and HCT.\nm Threshold for CD33 is not well-defined and may be ≥1% by flow cytometry .\nn In times of fludarabine shortage, cladribine can be substituted for fludarabine.\no Gemtuzumab ozogamicin may be beneficial in NPM1-mutated AML (Kapp-Schwoerer S, et al. Blood 2020;136:3041-3050). The role of gemtuzumab ozogamicin in \nCEBPA-mutated AML is not established. \np The RATIFY trial studied patients aged 18–60 y with FLT3-mutated AML. An extrapolation of the data suggests that patients aged 61–70 years with FLT3-mutated AML \nwho are fit to receive 7 + 3 should be offered midostaurin since it seems to provide a survival benefit without undue toxicity.

Blood 2012;119:2114-2121) \nand the Panel prioritizes clinical trial enrollment in this setting. While conventional induction chemotherapy regimens can be given in the setting of a TP53 mutation, \nless intensive chemotherapy is preferred for patients not enrolled in clinical trials (DiNardo CD, et al. N Engl J Med 2020;383:617-629; W elch JS, et al. N Engl J Med \n2016;375:2023-2036). \nr There are limited data supporting the use of this regimen in patients aged <60 years. For patients with AML with cytogenetic changes consistent with MDS (previously \nclassified as AML-MRC) and previous hypomethylating agent (HMA) exposure, the benefit from standard induction did not differ from the benefit with CPX-351/dual-\ndrug liposomal encapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin. Lancet JE, et al. J Clin Oncol 2018;36:2684-2692. While the mutational definition of AML-MRC as it \napplies to the use of CPX-351/dual-drug liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin was not studied in the original trial, its use can be considered.\ns Venetoclax combination regimens may be continued for patients whose disease demonstrates clinical improvement (CR/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery \n[CRi]), with consideration of subsequent transplant, where appropriate. DiNardo CD, et al. Lancet Oncol 2018;19:216-228; Wei A, et al. Blood 2017;130:890; DiNardo \nCD, et al. Blood 2019;133:7-17; DiNardo CD, et al. N Engl J Med 2020;383:617-629; Kadia TM, et al. J Clin Oncol 2022;40:3848-3857.\nt Patients whose disease has progressed to AML from MDS after significant exposure to HMAs (ie, azacitidine, decitabine) may be less likely to derive benefit from \ncontinued treatment with HMAs compared to patients who are HMA-naïve. Alternative treatment strategies should be considered. DiNardo CD, et al. Blood 2019;133:7-\n17.\nu Patients with disease in remission should take breaks between cycles.

For lack of response to induction, alternative therapy to achieve remission is encouraged prior to HCT. See NCCN Guidelines \nfor Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.\nkk Patients eligible for allogeneic HCT may require at least one cycle of consolidation while donor search is in progress or while awaiting collaboration with a transplant \ncenter to maintain remission.

Iron supplementation may be avoided in someone with excess iron \nlevels.\n• Consider use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), G-CSF, and thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics after a thorough discussion of potential \nrisks, benefits, and uncertainties. \n• Consider bed rest and supplemental oxygenation in patients with severe anemia.\nDisease-Specific Considerations\n• Test for actionable mutations and consider use of targeted agents instead of intensive chemotherapy, particularly in a non-curative setting.\n• May consider use of less myelosuppressive induction including dose reduction of anthracyclines, and use of non-intensive chemotherapy .6 \n• Consider referring to centers with experience in bloodless autologous HCT. \n1 Laszio D, Agazzi A, Goldhirsch A, et al.

Doses of cytarabine ≥2 g/m2 should be used with caution in patients ≥60 years and \npatients with renal failure due to concern for neurotoxicity.\ni Patients with disease in remission should take breaks between cycles. For more details about cycle length, see AML-J.\nj The use of doses of cytarabine ≥2 g/m2 for induction outside the setting of a clinical trial is still controversial. While the remission rates are the same for doses of \ncytarabine >100 to 200 mg/m2 and doses of cytarabine ≥2 g/m2, two studies have shown more rapid BM blast clearance after one cycle of high-dose therapy.

N Engl J Med 2007;356:348-359.PRINCIPLES OF SUPPORTIVE CARE FOR AML\nThere are variations among institutions, but the following issues are important to consider in the management of AML.\nGeneral\n• Blood products: \n\u0017Leukocyte-depleted products should be used for transfusion. \n\u0017All patients with AML are at risk for acute graft-versus-host disease \n(aGVHD) and management should be based on institutional \npractice/preference.  See NCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Cell \nTransplantation.\n\u0017Transfusion thresholds: red blood cell (RBC) counts for hemoglobin \n≤7 to 8 g/dL or per institutional guidelines or symptoms of anemia; \nplatelets for patients with platelets <10,000/mcL or with any signs of \nbleeding.a \n\u0017Cytomegalovirus (CMV) screening for potential HCT candidates may \nbe considered.\n• Tumor lysis prophylaxis: hydration with diuresis, and allopurinol or \nrasburicase. Rasburicase should be considered as initial treatment \nin patients with rapidly increasing blast counts, high uric acid, or \nevidence of impaired renal function. \n\u0017Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should \nbe checked when possible. However, it is not always feasible to do \nso rapidly. If there is high suspicion of G6PD deficiency, caution is \nnecessary; rasburicase may be contraindicated.\n• Unless a site-specific contraindication exists, a central venous access \ndevice (CVAD) with multiple lumens is recommended to allow the \nadministration of peripherally contraindicated systemic therapies and \npossibly multiple infusions during higher risk periods of cytopenias \nrelated to disease and/or myelosuppressive therapy. \n\u0017CVAD routine care and maintenance should be provided as per \ninstitutional policy.\n\u0017CVAD removal and/or replacement should be determined based on \nindividual clinical circumstances.\na Patients who are alloimmunized should receive cross-match–compatible \nand/or HLA-specific blood products.• Patients receiving doses of cytarabine ≥2 g/m2 (particularly those \nwith impaired renal function), or doses of cytarabine 1–1.5 g/m2 \n in patients >60 years of age, are at risk for cerebellar toxicity. \nNeurologic assessment, including tests for nystagmus, slurred \nspeech, and dysmetria, should be performed before each dose of \ncytarabine. \n\u0017In patients exhibiting rapidly rising creatinine due to tumor \nlysis, doses of cytarabine ≥2 g/m2 should be discontinued until \ncreatinine normalizes.\n\u0017In patients who develop cerebellar toxicity, cytarabine should be \nstopped. Rechallenge with doses of cytarabine ≥2 g/m2 in future \ntreatment cycles should not be attempted.1 \n• Steroid eye drops should be administered to both eyes 4 times \ndaily for all patients undergoing cytarabine therapy at doses of  \n≥2 g/m2 until 24 hours post completion of cytarabine.\n• Growth factors may be considered as a part of supportive care \nfor post-remission therapy. Note that such use may confound \ninterpretation of the BM evaluation. Patients should be off \ngranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or \nG-CSF for a minimum of 7 days before obtaining BM to document \nremission.\n• Decisions regarding use and choice of antibiotics should be made \nby the individual institutions based on the prevailing organisms \nand their drug resistance patterns. Posaconazole has been shown \nto significantly decrease fungal infections when compared to \nfluconazole and itraconazole.2 Outcomes with other azoles, such \nas voriconazole, echinocandins, or amphotericin B, may produce \nequivalent results. See the NCCN Guidelines for the Prevention and \nTreatment of Cancer-Related Infections and commensurate with the \ninstitutional practice for antibiotic stewardship.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

If the patient is receiving nephrotoxic agents, closer monitoring is required \nthrough the period of hospitalization.\n• Consider reduced frequency of labs to 1–2 times per week following completion of chemotherapy based on individual circumstances, such \nas degree of count recovery, intensity of induction, and/or patient preference.\n• Coagulation panel 1–2 times per week. \n\u0017For patients who have evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), coagulation parameters including fibrinogen should be \nmonitored daily until resolution of DIC.\n• BM aspirate/biopsy 14–21 days after start of therapy to document hypoplasia. If hypoplasia is not documented or indeterminate, repeat biopsy \nwithin 7 days to clarify persistence of leukemia. If hypoplasia, then repeat biopsy at time of hematologic recovery to document remission. If \ncytogenetics were initially abnormal, include cytogenetics as part of the remission documentation.\nPost-Remission Therapy\n• CBC, platelets 2 times per week during chemotherapy.\n• Chemistry profile, electrolytes daily during chemotherapy.\n• Outpatient monitoring post chemotherapy: CBC, platelets, differential, and electrolytes 2–3 times per week until recovery .\n• BM aspirate/biopsy only if peripheral blood counts are abnormal or if counts have not recovered within 5 weeks.\n• Patients with AML with high-risk features, including poor-prognosis cytogenetics, therapy-related AML, prior MDS, or possibly 2 or more \ninductions to achieve a CR are at increased risk for relapse and should be considered for early alternate donor search, as indicated on AML-6.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Patients whose \ndisease achieved a CR by morphologic assessment alone can still harbor a large number of leukemic cells in the BM.2 After completion of \ntherapy, “molecular relapses” can predict hematologic relapses within a 3- to 6-month timeframe.1\n• There are distinct differences between diagnostic threshold assessments and MRD assessments. Standard next-generation sequencing \n(NGS) diagnostic tests are not designed for MRD assessment due to inferior sensitivity .\n• With contemporary measurement techniques, the role of MRD in treatment decision-making is evolving.\n• The threshold to define MRD+ and MRD- samples depends on the technique and subgroup of AML. \n• There are commercially available tests that can be used for MRD assessments, as well as further testing methods at certain academic \ncenters.\n• The most frequently employed methods for MRD assessment include quantitative molecular assays such as real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-\nPCR) and multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) assays specifically designed to detect abnormal MRD immunophenotypes.2\n• The optimal sample for initial MRD assessment is a first, dedicated pull of the BM aspirate. The quality of the sample is of paramount \nimportance to have reliable evaluation. Once MRD-negative remission by BM is achieved, peripheral blood can be utilized for surveillance of \nMRD for PML:RAR alpha, NPM1,3 CBFB::MYH11, and RUNX1::RUNX1T1 .4\n• Mutations associated with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and aging (ie, DNMT3A, TET2, potentially ASXL1) are not \nconsidered reliable markers for MRD and are difficult to differentiate in routine practice.5-7General\nMethods of Testing\nFlow Cytometry \n• If using flow cytometry to assess MRD, it is recommended that a specific MRD assay that incorporates leukemia-associated \nimmunophenotypes (LAIPs) assessment is utilized, but, most importantly , that it is interpreted by an experienced hematopathologist, \npreferably at the same laboratory as diagnostic flow cytometry for consistency . Utilization of an assay with minimum limit of detection of \n≤10-3 is recommended.\nMolecular\n• The Panel recommends RQ-PCR for detection of NPM1,3 CBFB::MYH11, and RUNX1::RUNX1T1 .4 Utilization of an assay with minimum limit of \ndetection of ≤10-4 is recommended.\n• For detection of FLT3-ITD, the Panel recommends a highly sensitive, NGS-based, targeted, deep-sequencing assay with a sensitivity level of \n≤10-5.\n• The Panel does not routinely recommend other NGS–based assays to detect mutated genes (targeted sequencing, 20–50 genes per panel)5,6 \nfor MRD assessment due to inferior sensitivity.\nReferences on AML-H 3 of 3ContinuedPLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Therefore, repeat testing may be obtained.Timing of MRD Assessment\n• It is recommended that repeat testing should be performed within a short interval (eg, 1 month) if there is no hematologic relapse and \na BM biopsy and aspirate should be performed. Confirmation of MRD positivity in this setting is an indicator of high risk of relapse and \nconsideration should be made for allogeneic HCT, clinical trial, consolidation strategies, targeted therapy where appropriate, or therapy for \nrelapsed/refractory disease as clinically indicated. \n• For NPM1, CBFB::MYH11, and RUNX1::RUNX1T1- mutated AML, if MRD is persistently positive after induction and/or consolidation, consider \na clinical trial or alternative therapies, including allogeneic HCT.Management of MRD Positivity\n• In a study of patients with NPM1-mutated AML, proceeding to allogeneic HCT in CR1 led to a significant improvement in OS for patients with \nMRD-detectable disease but no benefit for patients with MRD-negative disease.9 \n• In a planned subgroup analysis of the MORPHO trial, post-transplant maintenance therapy with gilteritinib was found to improve relapse-free \nsurvival (RFS) (P = .0105) and OS ( P = .0731) for patients with BM FLT3-ITD MRD ≥10-6 by PCR-NGS pre- or post-allogeneic HCT.10 \n• The SORMAIN trial revealed that post-transplant sorafenib maintenance had the greatest impact for patients with FLT3-ITD AML who \nachieved MRD negativity pre-transplant and those with detectable MRD post-transplant.11\n• In a subgroup analysis of the QUAZAR AML-001 trial, oral azacitidine maintenance therapy significantly improved survival among patients \nwho were ineligible for allogeneic HCT with NPM1-mutated AML in CR1 following intensive chemotherapy, with either detectable or \nundetectable MRD by MFC.12\n• In an analysis of patients treated with azacitidine + venetoclax on the VIALE-A  trial, those who achieved composite CR (CRc) with MRD \n<10-3 by MFC had improvements in median duration of remission and event-free survival (EFS), as well as a significant improvement in OS \ncompared to patients with MRD ≥10-3.13Relevant Clinical Trial Results\nReferences on AML-H 3 of 3PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

MS-2 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nOverview  \nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematologic \nmalignancy characterized by the clonal expansion of myeloid blasts in the \nperipheral blood, bone marrow  (BM) , and/or other tissues. It is the most \ncommon form of acute leukemia among adults and accounts for the \nlargest number of annual deaths from leukemias in the United States.1 An \nestimated 22,020  people will be diagnosed with AML in 202 5, and 11,090 \npatients will die of the disease.1 According to the SEER Cancer Statistics \nReview, the median age at diagnosis is 68 years , with approximately 60% \nof patients diagnosed at ≥65 years of age and approximately a third \ndiagnosed at ≥75 years of age.2 Other registries report the median age of \ndiagnosis at 71 years .3 Thus, as the population ages, the incidence of \nAML, along with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), seems to be rising.  \nEnvironmental factors that have long been established to increase the \nrisks of MDS and AML include prolonged exposure to petrochemicals; \nsolvents such as benzene; pesticides; and ionizing radiation.4  \nTherapy -related MDS/AML (secondary MDS/AML) is a well -recognized \nconsequence of cancer treatment in a proportion of patients receiving \ncytotoxic therapy for solid tumors or hematologic malignancies. Reports \nsuggest that therapy -related MDS/AML may account for 5% to 20% of \npatients with MDS/AML.5-7 The rate of therapy -related MDS/AML is higher \namong patients with certain primary tumors, including breast cancer, \ngynecologic cancers, and lymphomas (both non -Hodgkin lymphoma and \nHodgkin lymphoma), largely owing to the more leukemogenic cytotoxic \nagents that are commonly used in the treatment of these tumors.7-10 Two \nwell-documented categories of cytotoxic agents associated with the \ndevelopment of therapy -related MDS/AML are alkylating agents and \ntopoisomerase inhibitors.5,8,9 Treatment with antimetabolites, such as the purine analog fludarabine, has also been associated with therapy -related \nMDS/AML in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders, particularly when \nadministered in combination with alkylating agents.11,12 Radiation therapy \n(RT), especially in the context of myeloablative therapy (eg, total  body \nirradiation  [TBI] , radioimmunotherapy) given before autologous \nhematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may also increase the risk for \ntherapy -related MDS/AML.13,14 The disease course of therapy -related \nMDS/AML is generally progressive and may be more resistant to \nconventional cytotoxic therapies than de novo  cases of MDS/AML.9 \nImportantly, clinical outcomes in patients with therapy -related AML have \nbeen shown to be significantly inferior (both in terms of relapse -free \nsurvival [RFS] and overall survival [OS]) compared with patients with de \nnovo  cases,8,15 except those with the therapy -related acute promyelocytic \nleukemia (APL) subtype .7,16 The proportion of patients with unfavorable \ncytogenetics tends to be higher in the population with therapy -related \nAML. Even among patients with core binding factor (CBF) translocations, \nwhich are associated with favorable outcomes, patients with therapy -\nrelated CBF-AML tend to do less well .17 \nThe Panel  for the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN \nGuidelines®) for Acute Myeloid Leukemia convenes annually to update \nrecommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of AML in adults. These \nrecommendations are based on a review of recently published clinical \ntrials that have led to significant improvements in treatment or have \nyielded new infor mation regarding biologic factors that may have \nprognostic importance.  \nGuidelines Update Methodology  \nThe complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN \nGuidelines are available at www.NCCN.org .

MS-3 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nLiterature Search Criteria  \nPrior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines® for AML, an electronic search \nof the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature in AML \npublished since the previous Guidelines update , using the following search \nterms: acute myeloid leukemia or acute promyelocytic leukemia  or blastic \nplasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm . The PubMed database was chosen \nas it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and \nindexes peer -reviewed biomedical literature.18 Results were confined to \nthe following article types: Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; \nGuideline; Practice Guideline; Meta -Analysis; Randomized Controlled \nTrial; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.  \nThe data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional \nsources deemed as relevant to these Guidelines and discussed by the \nPanel during the Guidelines update have been included in this version of \nthe Discussion section. Recommendations for which high -level evidence is \nlacking are based on the Panel’s review of lower -level evidence and \nexpert opinion.  \nSensitive/Inclusive Language Usage  \nNCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of \nequity, inclusion, and representation.19 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use \nlanguage that is person -first; not stigmatizing; anti -racist, anti -classist, \nanti-misogynist, anti -ageist, anti -ableist, and anti -weight -biased; and \ninclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. \nNCCN Guidelines incorporate non -gendered language, instead focusing \non organ -specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate \nand more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of \nall sexual orientations and gender identit ies. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing \nstatistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do \nnot use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender \ndata are collected and use these terms inte rchangeably or inconsistently. \nIf sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs \npresent, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender \nindividuals. NCCN encourages researchers to colle ct more specific data in \nfuture studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate \nlanguage in their future analyses.  \nInitial Evaluation  \nThe initial evaluation of AML has two objectives. The first is to characterize \nthe disease process based on factors such as prior toxic exposure, \nantecedent myelodysplasia, and karyotypic and molecular abnormalities, \nwhich may provide prognostic information that can impact responsiveness \nto chemotherapy , risk of relapse , and appropriateness for the use of \ntargeted therapies . The second objective focuses on patient -specific \nfactors, including assessment of comorbid conditions, which may affect an \nindividual’ s ability to tolerate therapy. Both disease -specific and individual \npatient factors are taken into consideration when deciding on a treatment  \nstrategy . \nWorkup  \nThe evaluation and initial workup for suspected AML consists of a \ncomprehensive medical history and physical examination. Laboratory \nevaluations include a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete \nblood count (CBC) , including platelets and a differential of white blood \ncells (WBCs). Serum uric acid and lactate dehydrogenase  (LDH)  have \nprognostic relevance and should be evaluated.20,21 Vitamin B12 and folic PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Molecular analyses for lesions that allow risk stratification \nper ELN 2022 are recommended for all patients at diagnosis (see Risk \nStratification by Biological Disease Factors ). This includes but is not \nlimited to  ASXL1 , BCOR , EZH2, FLT3 -internal tandem duplication ( ITD), \nFLT3 -tyrosine kinase domain ( TKD), KIT, NPM1 , in-frame basic leucine \nzipper ( bZIP ) insertions/deletions  in CEBPA , IDH1/IDH2 , RUNX1 , SF3B1 , \nSRSF2 , STAG2 , TP53 , U2AF1 , ZRSR2 , BCR ::ABL, and  PML::RARα (See \nRisk Stratification by Biological Disease Factors for Patients with  Non-APL \nAML Treated with Intensive Induction Chemotherapy in the algorithm) .22 \nOther genetic lesions may have therapeutic significance. The field of \ngenomics in myeloid malignancies and related implications in AML are \nevolving rapidly. All patients should be tested for mutations, and multiplex \ngene panels and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis are \nrecommended for the ongoing management of AML in various phases of \ntreatment .22-24 Additional molecular and genetic testing for heritable \nhematologic malignancy predisposition may be considered in a subset of \npatients, particularly in patients <50 years of age  or with a family history . \nSee MDS -D and MDS -E in the NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic \nSyndromes . To appropriately stratify therapy options, test results of molecular and \ncytogenetic analyses of immediately actionable genes  or chromosomal \nabnormalities  should be expedited. For patients with hyperleukocytosis , \nhydroxyurea , leukaph eresis , or a single  dose of cytarabine  (1–2 g) may be \nconsidered prior to initiation of therapy . A retrospective study of three  \nclinical trials compared the use of cytoreduction with hydroxyurea or \ncytarabine versus  no cytoreduction .25 There was no significant difference \nin OS between the two groups , with 30 - and 60 -day mortality rates of 2% \nand 7% versus  2% (P = .978) and 6% ( P = .652), suggesting that urgent \ncytoreduction with hydroxyurea or cytarabine while awaiting complete \ndiagnostic information is a safe approach that may provide a bridge to \nappropriate incorporation of targeted therapies or clinical trial enrollment.25 \nFor patients who prefer not to receive blood transfusions as part of \ntherapy, see Supportive Care for Patients with AML Who Prefer Not to \nReceive Blood Transfusions for general considerations , although the \ncommittee believes that in most  cases, good outcomes from these  \nstrateg ies are rare . If blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm \n(BPDCN) is suspected, see Management of B lastic Plasmacytoid \nDendritic Cell Neoplasm  for workup, diagnosis , and treatment \nrecommendations.  \nStudies have reported on the prognostic impact of a number of molecular \nabnormalities in patients with AML (see Risk Stratification by Biological \nDisease Factors ). Adequate marrow should be available at the time of \ndiagnosis or relapse for molecular studies as per the institutional practice. \nLocal pathologists should be consulted to discuss ways to optimize \nsample collection and preservation.

Circulating leukemic blasts from peripheral \nblood may alternatively be used to detect molecular abnormalities.  \nExtramedullary presentation, including central nervous system (CNS) \ndisease, is uncommon in patients with AML. However, if extramedullary \ndisease is suspected, a n FDG -PET/CT should be considered . Patients \nwith significant CNS signs or symptoms at presentation should be \nevaluated using appropriate imaging techniques, such as radiography, CT, \nor MRI for the detection of intracranial bleeding, leptomeningeal disease, \nor mass lesions in either the br ain or spinal cord. If CNS hemorrhage is \nsuspected, a CT of the brain without contrast is recommended. If leukemic \nmeningitis is suspected, a brain MRI with  and without  contrast is \nrecommended. However, if symptoms persist, and bleeding and mass  \nlesions are excluded, the patient should have a lumbar puncture (LP) for \ndiagnostic purposes once coagulopathy has been corrected, adequate \nplatelet support is available, and the circulating disease has been cleared \nthrough the initiation of systemic thera py. One dose of intrathecal (IT) \nchemotherapy (methotrexate , cytarabine , or a combination of these \nagents ) can be considered at the time of diagnostic LP. Routine screening \nLPs are not warranted at the time of diagnosis in patients with AML. \nHowever, for patients at high risk for CNS disease, such as those with \nmonocytic differentiation , other extramedullary involvement,  or high WBC \ncount (>40  x 109/L)26 at presentation, a diagnostic LP should be \nconsidered as part of the documentation of remission status. Screening \nLPs should be considered at first remission before first consolidation in \npatients with monocytic differentiation, mixed phenotype acute leuk emia \n(MPAL), WBC count >40 x 109/L at diagnosis, high -risk APL, FLT3 \nmutations , or extramedullary disease, particularly in patients not receiving \ndoses of  cytarabine ≥2 g/m2 (ie, patients  who are not fit for intensive \ninduction therapy ). For patients who p resent  with solitary extramedullary disease (currently referred to as myeloid sarcoma, and historically as \ngranulocytic sarcoma , or chloroma) without overt marrow disease, the \ninitial treatment should still be based on systemic induction chemotherapy. \nRT or surgical resection may be incorporated with systemic chemotherapy \nin emergent situations; however, these modalities, if needed at all, should \nbe optimally deferred until after count recovery to avoid excess toxicity.  \nCoagulopathy is common at presentation in many leukemias; it is \ntherefore standard clinical practice to screen for coagulopathy by \nevaluating prothrombin time  (PT), partial thromboplastin time  (PTT) , and \nfibrinogen activity as part of the initial evaluation and before performing \nany invasive procedure. The need for a cardiac evaluation (eg, \nechocardiogram or multigated acquisition [MUGA] scan) should be \ndetermined based on individual risk factors. Pa tients with a history or \nsymptoms of cardiac disease, prior exposure to cardiotoxic drugs or \nthoracic RT, or those of an older age, should have an echocardiogram. In \npatients who are younger and are otherwise a symptomatic with no history \nof cardiac disease , an echocardiogram can be considered. In cases of \npatients who are acutely ill, treatment should not be delayed for an \nechocardiogram. A small study of 76 patients with cancer who were \nscreened for cardiac disease identified only 4 patients with cardiac \nabnormalities. Of these 4 patients, the presence of cardiac disease did not \nchange the course of treatment.27  \nEarly referral to a transplant center is recommended  and human leukocyte \nantigen (HLA) typing should be performed in all patients with newly \ndiagnosed AML for whom allogeneic HCT would be considered. HLA \ntyping of family members is recommended for these patients and tissue \ntyping should be broadened to include alternative donor searches.

Fertility perseveration \nmay be considered for appropriate patients (see NCCN Guidelines for \nAYA Oncology ).  \nEarly integration of palliative care should also be considered.  See NCCN \nGuidelines for Palliative Care . A randomized trial of 160 patients with AML \nassessed  patient -reported outcomes in those receiving integrated \npalliative and oncology care compared to patients assigned to usual \ncare.28 Patients assigned to integrated palliative and oncology care \nreported better quality of life ( P = .048), less depression ( P = .04), less \nanxiety ( P = .04), and less post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) \nsymptoms ( P = .002) during intensive chemotherapy and for up to 24 \nweeks.  \nDiagnosis  \nOriginally, the classification system for AML was defined by the French \nAmerican British (FAB) system, which relied on cytochemical stains and \nmorphology to separate AML from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) \nand to categorize the disease based on degree of myeloid and monocytic \ndifferentiation. In 1999, WHO developed a newer classification system, \nwhich incorporates information from cytogenetics and evidence of \nantecedent myelodysplasia, to refine prognostic subgroups that may \ndefine treatment strategies.29 During this transition from the FAB system to \nthe WHO classification, the percent blasts threshold for defining \nhigh-grade MDS and AML was lowered. The FAB classification had set \nthe threshold between high -grade MDS and AML at 30% blasts, whereas \nthe WHO classification lowered the threshold for diagnosing AML to ≥20% blasts . This change was based on the finding that the biologic behavior \n(and survival outcomes) of the FAB MDS subgroup of “refractory anemia \nwith excess blasts in transformation (RAEB -T),” de fined as patients with \n20% to 30% blasts, was similar compared with that of patients with >30% \nblasts. In an appropriate clinical setting, the WHO classification system \nfurther allowed AML to be diagnosed in patients with abnormal \nhematopoiesis and characteristic clonal structural cytogenetic \nabnormalities with t(15;17), t(8;21), and inv(16) or t(16;16) regardless of \nthe percentage of marrow blasts . \nIn 2003, the International Working Group for Diagnosis, Standardization of \nResponse Criteria accepted the cytochemical and immunophenotypic \nWHO criteria as the standard for diagnosing AML, including the reporting \nof myelodysplasia according to morphology.30 However, no evidence \nshows that myelodysplasia represents an independent risk factor, likely \nbecause it is frequently linked to poor -risk cytogenetics.  \nIn 2008, WHO revised the diagnostic and response criteria for AML to \ninclude additional recurrent genetic abnormalities created by reciprocal \ntranslocations/inversions, and a new provisional category for some of the \nmolecular markers that have been found t o have a prognostic impact.31 \nAdditionally, the category of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities was \nexpanded to include the following: t(9;11)(p22;q23), t(6;9)(p23;q34) \n(provisional entity), inv(3)(q21 q26.2) or inv(3;3)(q21;q26.2) (provisional \nentity), and t(1;22)(p13;q13) (prov isional entity), in addition to the \npreviously recognized t(8;21)(q22;q22); inv(16)(p13;1q22) or \nt(16;16)(p13.1;q22); and t(15;17)(q22;q12) [APL subtype]. Other \nprovisional entities include d AML with molecular abnormalities such as \nmutated NPM1 or CEBPA genes (further information on these genetic \nlesions is provided later).31  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

MS-7 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \n \nIn 2016, WHO expanded the recurrent genetic abnormalities to include \ntwo provisional categories, AML with BCR ::ABL1  rearrangement and AML \nwith RUNX1 mutation.32 AML with BCR ::ABL1  rearrangement is a rare de \nnovo  AML that may benefit from therapies that entail tyrosine kinase \ninhibitors. AML with RUNX1  mutation is associated with a poorer \nprognosis  in patients treated with intensive chemotherapy .  \n \nIn 2022, WHO  eliminated blast cutoffs for most types of AML with defining \ngenetical alterations (excluding AML with BCR ::ABL1 and AML with \nCEBPA  mutation), though the 20% blast cutoff to differentiate MDS from \nAML was retained.33 AML with defining genetic abnormalities (eg, AML \nwith NPM1  mutation, AML with RUNX1 ::RUNX1T1  fusion) was also \nseparated from AML defined by differentiation (eg, AML with maturation, \nAML with minimal differentiation) , eliminating  the term AML , not otherwise \nspecified (NOS) .33 A new section on AML with other defined genetic \nalterations was also added , with incorporation of subtypes of AML with \nrare genetic fusions .33 In addition, the term AML  with \nmyelodysplasia -related changes (AML -MRC) was replaced with the term \nAML, myelodysplasia -related (AML -MR). Updates were made to the \ndefining cytogenetic criteria for this type of AML and a mutation -based \ndefinition was introduced based on the following 8 genes: SRSF2, SF3B1, \nU2AF1, ZRSR2, ASXL1, EZH2, BCOR, and STAG2.33 \nThe accurate classification of AML requires multidisciplinary diagnostic \nstudies including morphology, immunophenotyping  (IHC and flow \ncytometry) , and molecular genetics analysis.  The latter should include the \nanalysis of structural variations by cytogenetics, FISH, or whole -genome \nsequencing and advanced molecular analysis techniques, as needed, to \nspecify both translocations and gene mutations.  The NCCN AML Panel suggests that complementary diagnostic techniques can be used at the \ndiscretion of the pathology department of the individual institution. Some \ncases may still show evidence of both myeloid and lymphoid antigen \nexpression on the leukemic cells and are defi ned as acute leu kemias of \nambiguous lineage  (ALAL) and MPAL , which were grouped into a single \ncategory with the WHO 2022 update to reflect their overlapping \nimmunophenotypic and clinical characteristics.33 With the WHO 2022 \nupdate, ALAL/MPAL were separated into those with defining genetic \nabnormalities and those defined based on immunophenotyping only. \nLineage assignment criteria were refined to highlight principles of intensity \nand pattern. In addition, MPAL with ZNF384  rearrangement and ALAL with \nBCL11B  rearrangement were added as subtypes of ALAL with defining \ngenetic alterations.33 Due to the rarity of ALAL/MPAL,  consultation with an \nexperienced hematopathologist should be sought.  \nCurrently, there are discrepancies between two recognized classification \nsystems for AML , WHO and the International Consensus Classification \n(ICC) .33,34  For example, as noted previously, WHO 2022 eliminated blast \ncutoffs for most types of AML with genetical alterations, while the ICC \nretains a blast cutoff of ≥10% for AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities. \nIn addition, ICC 2022 created a separate category of AML with mutated \nTP53 that supersedes their classifications of AML with myelodysplasia -\nrelated gene mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities. ICC also \nrecognized a new category of MDS/AML in 2022 which requires 10 -19% \nblasts while WHO 2022 has retai ned the classification of MDS -increased \nblasts.  \nThe NCCN Guidelines do not advocate for one over another.

The NCCN \nAML Panel has adopted the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) \nrecommendations for risk stratificatio n,22 which were updated in 2022  (See \nRisk Stratification by Biological Disease Factors for Patients with  Non-APL \nAML Treated with Intensive Induction Chemotherapy in the algorithm) .ELN  \nrisk categories  are  based on results observed in  patients treated with  \nintensive induction chemotherapy ; however, as use of venetoclax -based \nregimens in the upfront setting has increased, data has emerged that \ncertain genetic abnormalities that confer poor outcomes with intensive \nchemotherapy are associated with improved survival in the setting of lower \nintensity therapy with venetoclax .  \nCytogenetics   \nIn an analysis of data from pediatric and adult patients with AML \n(n = 1612) enrolled in the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (UK \nMRC) AML 10 trial, the 5 -year survival rates for those with AML with \nfavorable -, intermediate -, and unfavorable -risk cytogenetics were 65%, 41%, and 14%, respectively.35 In a review of data from adult patients \ntreated in a phase III Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)/Eastern \nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) intergroup study (n  = 609), the \n5-year survival rates for those with  AML with  favorable -, intermediate -, and \nadverse -risk cytogenetics were 55%, 38%, and 11%, respectively.36 \nSimilarly, in a retrospective review of adult patients with AML treated on \nCancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocols (n  = 1213), the 5 -year \nsurvival rates for patients with AML with favorable -, intermediate -, and \npoor-risk cytogenetics were 55%, 24%, and 5%, respectively.37 The AML \n11 trial had similar results with 5 -year survival rates for those with AML \nwith favorable -, intermediate -, and poor -risk cytogenetics of 34%, 13%, \nand 2%, respectively.38 This last study included a population of patients  \n≥55 years  of age , which is believed to attribute to the overall lower percent \nsurvival in all groups.  \nThe importance of obtaining adequate samples of marrow or peripheral \nblood at diagnosis for full karyotyping and FISH cytogenetic analysis for \nthe most common abnormalities cannot be overemphasized. Although \nFISH studies for common cytogenetic abnormalitie s may allow for rapid \nscreening to identify either favorable -, intermediate -, or poor/adverse -risk \ngroups, additional tests are needed to provide a full picture of the genetic \nfactors that contribute to risk (see Molecular Markers ). \nThe presence of autosomal chromosome monosomies in AML has \nemerged as an important prognostic factor associated with extremely poor \nprognosis.39-41 Data from three large studies have identified monosomal \nkaryotypes (defined as ≥2 autosomal monosomies, or a single monosomy \nwith an additional structural abnormality) as a subset of unfavorable \ncytogenetic prognosticators.

MS-9 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \ncategorized as high -risk/poor/adverse cytogenetics, the presence of a \nmonosomal karyotype was found to confer further negative prognostic \ninfluence within the high -risk group. This high -risk subgroup was first \nidentified in a joint study conducted by the Dutch -Belgian -Swiss \ncooperative groups (HOVON/SAKK), which evaluated the correlation \nbetween cytogenetics and OS outcomes in patients ≥60 years  of age  with \nAML (n  = 1975). The 4 -year OS rate in patients with  AML with  monosomal \nkaryotype was 4% compared with  26% in those with AML with complex \nkaryotype (but without monosomal karyotype).39  \nThese findings were confirmed in subsequent analyses from other large \ncooperative group studies. In an analysis of data from patients treated on \nSWOG protocols (n  = 1344; age 16 –88 years), 13% of patients were \nfound to have monosomal karyotype ; nearly all of these cases (98%) \noccurred within the unfavorable cytogenetics category.40 The incidence of \nmonosomal karyotype increased with age, from 4% in patients ≥30 years \nof age to 20% in patients >60 years  of age. Among the unfavorable \ncytogenetics  cohort , the 4 -year OS rate in the setting of  monosomal \nkaryotype was 3% compared with 13% in the subgroup without \nmonosomal karyotype. In patients with  AML with  monosomy 7, \nmonosomal karyotype did not appear to influence outcomes (4 -year OS, \n0%–3%); the 4 -year OS rates for patients with AML with inv(3)/t(3;3) and \nt(6;9) and those with AML without monosomal karyotype were 0% and 9%, \nrespectively.40 In a retrospective study that evaluated the prognostic \nimpact of monosomal karyotype in patients >60 years  of age  (n = 186) \nwith unfavorable cytogenetics treated in a GOELAMS trial, the 2 -year OS \nrate was significantly decreased among patients with AML with \nmonosomal karyotype compared  with patients with AML without this \nabnormality (7% vs. 22%; P < .0001). Similar outcomes were observed \nwithin the subgroup of patients with  AML with  complex karyotype.41  These studies show that monosomal karyotype, independent of other \nadverse  cytogenetic factors, confers very poor prognosis. In the NCCN \nGuidelines, the presence  of monosomal karyotype is included in the \npoor/adverse -risk category of AML based on cytogenetics (see Risk \nStratification by Biological Disease Factors for Patients with  Non-APL AML  \nTreated with Intensive Induction Chemotherapy  in the algorithm).  \nMolecular Markers  \nThe intermediate -risk cytogenetic category is the most heterogeneous \ngroup in AML, because it encompasses both normal karyotype AML \n(NK-AML) without gross structural abnormalities and those with structural \nchanges that are considered neither adverse risk nor favorable. Based on \nretrospective analyses of data from large cooperative group studies, 40% \nto 50% of patients with de novo AML have normal karyotype, which is \nassociated with intermediate risk as measured in terms of survival \noutcomes.35,37 However, even in patients with NK -AML, clinical outcome is \nheterogeneous.  \nIdentification of mutations that carry prognostic and therapeutic impact is \nrendering molecular profiling for all AML cases a standard part of the \ndiagnostic workup. In addition to basic cytogenetic analysis, new \nmolecular markers can help refine prognosti cs groups, particularly in the \nsetting of  a normal karyotype. These markers include NPM1 , FLT3 , \nCEBPA , IDH1/2, DNMT3A , and KIT, TP53 , RUNX1 , and ASXL1  gene \nmutations.42-54 Tests for these molecular markers are now available in \ncommercial reference laboratories and in referral centers. Therefore, it is \nimportant for physicians to confer with the local pathologist on how to \noptimize sample collection from the time of diagnosi s for subsequent \nmolecular diagnostic tests. Testing for additional mutations may also be \nrecommended.

MS-10 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nNPM1 Mutations  \nThe NPM1  gene encodes a shuttle protein within the nucleolus of cells. \nMutations in this gene occur in 28% to 35% of AML cases.52,55,56 The \nNPM1  mutation has been shown to be associated with NK -AML with a \nreported frequency of 48% to 53%.44,50,57 Isolated NPM1  mutation, which \nlocalizes to the cytoplasm, confers a higher complete remission  (CR) rate \nand improved event -free survival (EFS) and OS compared with patients \nwho have NK-AML with wild-type NPM1 , resulting in outcomes similar to \npatients with CBF -AML.44,45,50,52,53 However, a meta -analysis revealed that \nwhen adverse -risk cytogenetics are present, NPM1  mutation is associated \nwith poor outcome.58  \nFLT3 Mutations  \nThe FLT3  gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in \nhematopoiesis. Two major classes of activating FLT3  mutations have \nbeen identified in AML, which include the ITD and TKD point mutations.59-\n64 FLT3 -ITD mutations occur in approximately 30% of cases and are more \ncommon than FLT3 -TKD mutations, which occur in approximately 10% of \ncases .42,46,57,63 -67  \nNumerous studies have shown the negative prognostic influence of \nFLT3 -ITD in patients with AML, resulting in shorter remission durations \n(eg, decreased disease -free survival [DFS] in patients who achieve a CR) \nand poorer survival outcomes compared with patients who have wild -type \nFLT3  AML.42,46,60,61,63,65,66,68 Among patients with FLT3 -ITD and NK -AML, \nmedian OS from the time of diagnosis ranged from 6 to 12 months.42,46,63,66  \nInterestingly, a study in patients with NK -AML showed that prognosis was \nworse among patients with AML with FLT3 -ITD without wild -type FLT3 , \ncompared with those with FLT3 -ITD with wild -type FLT3  in the second allele. The median OS among patients with FLT3 -ITD in the absence of a \nwild-type FLT3  was only 7 months compared with 46 months among \npatients with wild-type FLT3 with or without FLT3 -ITD.63 The FLT3 -TKD \nmutations predominantly occur independently of FLT3 -ITD, and most \nfrequently involve mutations in the D835 residue of a TKD. Although the \npresence of FLT3 -TKD mutations has been shown to be associated with \nshorter remission durations (eg, decreased DFS) and decreased OS \noutcomes in some studies,46,60,64,67 other studies have reported no impact \nof FLT3 -TKD on prognosis57,68,69 or even a favorable outcome on OS with \nFLT3 -TKD mutations.70 In the latter study from the UK MRC, the 5 -year \nOS rates among patients with and without FLT3 -TKD mutations were 53% \nversus 37%, respectively. Patients with a higher level of FLT3 -TKD \nmutations (>25%) had a significantly higher 5 -year OS rate compared with \nthose with lower levels of mutations, which showed an OS rate similar to \nthat of patients without FLT3 -TKD mutations (71% vs. 37%; adjusted \nP = .004).70  \nThe discrepant findings from these studies may be a result of important \ndifferences such as patient baseline characteristics, presence of \nconcurrent genetic lesions (eg, NPM1, CEBPA  mutations), or inclusion of \nthe APL subtypes. Studies have shown that FLT3 -TKD mutations can \noccur in a subgroup of patients with the prognostically favorable NPM1  or \nCEBPA  mutations.57,69 Moreover, FLT3 -TKD mutations as the sole genetic \naberration or occurring concurrently with t(15;17)/ PML::RARA  (underlying \nlesion in the APL subtype) or with FLT3 -ITD ( FLT3  double mutation) ha ve \nbeen associated with poorer outcomes.57,69 \nCEBPA Mutations  \nAnother mutation associated with prognosis is the CEBPA  gene, a \ntranscription factor that plays a key role in the differentiation of PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

The 8 -year OS rates reported in this study for patients with \ndouble -mutant –positive, single -mutation, and wild -type CEBPA  genes \nwere 54%, 31%, and 34%, respectively.72 The revised 2016 WHO \nclassification of AML redefined mutated CEBPA  to indicate that biallelic \nmutation s (and not single CEBPA  mutation s) are associated with improved \nprognosis.32  \nMore recent studies have investigated the prognostic significance of \nCEBPA  mutations  or insertions/deletions  in the bZIP region , irrespective of \nbiallelic status .74-76 In a report from the Children’s Oncology Group  (COG) , \nCEBPA  mutations in 2958 children and young adults with newly diagnosed \nAML were evaluated, including a cohort with a single CEBPA -bZIP \nmutation and a cohort harboring a second CEBPA  mutation \n(CEBPA -double -mutated [ CEBPA -dm]).74 EFS was identical between the \ntwo CEBPA  cohorts (64%) and OS was similar, at 81% for the CEBPA -dm \ncohort and 89% for  the CEBPA -bZIP cohort ( P = .259) . Outcomes were \nworse in the CEBPA  wild-type cohort, with EFS of 46% and OS of 61% \n(both P < .001). This study highlighted favorable outcomes in the setting of \nCEBPA -bZIP domain mutations, irrespective of monoallelic or biallelic \nstatus.  \nA retrospective analysis of 240 adult patients with AML with CEBPA  \nmutations revealed improved EFS in the setting of CEBPA-dm and CEBPA -bZIP  mutations compared to CEBPA mutations affecting the \nN-terminal transactivation domains  (CEBPAsmTAD), at 20.7,  17.1,  and 5.7 \nmonths,  respectively.75 Similarly,  OS was significantly  improved  in the \nsetting  of CEBPA-dm and CEBPA -bZIP  mutations compared to \nCEBPAsmTAD  mutations, at 103, 63, and 13 months,  respectively.   \nAn additional retrospective analysis evaluated prognosis in 1028 patients \nwith AML with CEBPA  mutations.76 The presence of CEBPA -bZIP \nmutations was associated with higher CR rate s compared  to AML without \nCEBPA -bZIP mutations (90.2% for all age groups, 92.7% for patients ≤70 \nyears  of age ; P < .001). AML with CEBPA -bZIP mutation was also \nassociated with longer OS than AML without CEBPA -bZIP mutation (not \nreached [NR] vs. 945 days for all age groups; P < .001 and NR vs. 1296 \ndays for patients ≤70 years  of age  and in the setting of intermediate -risk \nkaryotype; P < .001). Similarly, AML with CEBPA -bZIP mutation was \nassociated with longer median time to relapse than AML without \nCEBPA -bZIP mutation ( NR vs. 612 days for all age groups; P < .001 and \nNR vs. 671 days for patients ≤70 years  of age  and in the setting of \nintermediate -risk karyotype; P < .001). The favorable prognostic \nsignificance of CEBPA -bZIP mutations was also observed in the setting of \nsingle -mutated  CEBPA -sm (OS for all patients, P = .008; OS for patients \n≤70 years of age and in the setting of intermediate -risk karyotype, P = \n.008; cumulativ e incidence of relapse for all patients, P = .063; cumulative \nincidence of relapse for patients ≤70 years  of age  and in the setting of \nintermediate -risk karyotype, P = .026).

Some studies have reported the lack of prognostic value of \nIDH2 mutations,77,78,82 whereas others have reported favorable outcomes \nwith IDH2  mutations.56,83 In one study, an association was found between \nIDH2  mutations and poorer prognosis in the subgroup of patients with \nNK-AML and otherwise favorable risk ( NPM1 mutation without \nFLT3 -ITD).82 However, in another study, the IDH2  mutation (restricted to \nIDH2 -R140) was associated with improved survival among the overall \nstudy population, and among the subgroup of patients with favorable risk \n(intermediate -risk AML with NPM1 mutation without FLT3 -ITD).56 In this \nlatter subgroup, the presence of IDH1 or IDH2 mutations was associated \nwith a significantly increased 3 -year OS rate compared with NPM1 \nmutation without FLT3 -ITD and without IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (89% vs. \n31%; P < .0001). These results seem to suggest that in patients with \nNK-AML without FLT3 -ITD, NPM1 mutations confer a survival benefit only \nin the presence of concurrent IDH mutations.56  \nThe prognosis of IDH1 - or IDH2 -mutated AML is more recently being \nimpacted by the increasingly use of lower -intensity treatment options \nincluding  venetoclax -based regimens  and IDH1/2 inhibitors . In a \nretrospective study that evaluated 556 patients with newly diagnosed AML \nwith IDH1 , IDH2 , or NPM1  mutations, IDH1  mutations were associated \nwith an increased risk of death compared to IDH2  mutations; however , this \nrisk was partially negated by treatment with lower intensity, venetoclax -\nbased regimens .84 OS rates were similar between patients with IDH2 -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

In another  \nstudy including  81 patients (median age 74 years) with newly diagnosed \nAML treated with venetoclax combined with an HMA or LDAC, CR was \nachieved in 82% of patients with IDH1 -mutated AML and in 100% of \npatients with IDH-2 mutated AML.85  IDH1/2  inhibitors used alone or in \ncombination with venetoclax have also improved outcomes for IDH-\nmutated AML, with remission rates of >40 -50% single agent and >60 -70% \nwhen combined with venetoclax. 86-89 \nDNMT3A Mutations  \nThe DNMT3A  mutations have been reported in 18% to 22% of AML  \ncases ,56,90,91 with a frequency of 29% to 34% in those with NK -AML.92-94 \nR882 is the most commonly  mutated residue. This mutation has also been \nobserved in conjunction with NPM1 mutations and FLT3 mutations.91,93,94 \nData concerning the prognostic significance of DNMT3A mutations have \nthus far been conflicting. Some studies in the overall AML population and \nin patients with intermediate -risk disease reported no significant effect of \nDNMT3A mutations on survival outcomes,56,93 whereas other studies have \nshown a negative prognostic effect in the overall population or specific \nsubgroups.90-92,94 Studies have shown significantly decreased OS \noutcomes among patients with DNMT3A -mutat ed AML  compared with \npatients with DNMT3A wild-type AML (median OS, 12 –21 vs. 40 –41 \nmonths).90,91 Significantly decreased OS with DNMT3A  mutations has also been reported in the subgroup of patients with NK -AML who have \nwild-type NPM1  with or without FLT3 -ITD, or NPM1  mutation in the \npresence of FLT3 -ITD, but not in the favorable subgroup with NPM1  \nmutation without FLT3 -ITD.91 A study reported that in  patients <60 years  of \nage with NK -AML, the presence of DNMT3A mutations was associated \nwith significantly decreased OS compared with the wild -type gene (5 -year \nOS rate, 23% vs. 45%; P = .02).94 Another study also showed that in \npatients <60 years  of age  with NK -AML, a DNMT3A  mutation was \nassociated with significantly decreased DFS (3 -year rate, 20% vs. 49%; \nP = .007) and a trend toward decreased OS.92 In this latter study, \nnon-R882 DNMT3A  mutations were significantly associated with poorer \noutcomes in patients <60 years of age but not R882 mutations; in contrast, \nDNMT3A -R882 mutations (but not non -R882 mutations) in patients ≥60 \nyears of age were associated with significantly decreased DFS (3 -year \nrate, 3% vs. 21%; P = .006) and OS (3 -year rate, 4% vs. 24%; P = .01).92 \nThe authors concluded that the prognostic relevance of DNMT3A  \nmutations may depend on age and mutation type. Currently, the \ninteractions of IDH1 or IDH2 and DNMT3  mutations with other molecular \nchanges require further investigation to determine the prognostic value in \npatients with NK -AML.

In addition, 25% of cases had more than one of \nthese mutations. Mutations in KIT and RAS were less likely to occur \nconcurrently, whereas mutations in KIT and FLT3  occurred concurrently in \n6% of cases .99 Of these secondary genetic lesions, KIT mutation and \ntrisomy 22 were significant independent factors predictive of RFS in \nmultivariable analysis; FLT3  mutations, trisomy 22, and trisomy 8 were \nsignificant independent predictors for OS.99 These studies demonstrate \nthe importance of secondary genetic mutations in the prognostic \nclassification of patients with otherwise favorable -risk CBF -AML (see Risk \nStratification by Biological Disease Factors for Patien ts with  Non-APL AML  \nTreated with Intensive Induction Chemotherapy  in the algorithm).  \nKMT2A Rearrangements  \nThe mixed lineage leukemia gene ( MLL; also called HRX , ALL-1, or \ncurrently  KMT2A ), located on chromosome 11q23, was initially recognized \nas a recurrent locus of chromosomal translocation in AML and ALL.100,101 \nIn one series of 1897 AML cases, the incidence of 11q23/ KMT2A  \nrearrangements was 2.8%, and they were significantly higher in \ntherapy -related AML than in de novo  AML (9.4% vs. 2.6 %; P < .0001).102 \nThe frequency of KMT2A  rearrangements was also significantly higher in \npatients <60 years of age (5.3% vs. 0.8 %; P < .0001).102 Depending on the fusion partner, the 11q23/  KMT2A  rearrangement is associated with \nintermediate to poor prognosis.103-105 NK-AML can be characterized by \npartial tandem duplication in the KMT2A  gene ( KMT2A -PTD),106-108 and \nKMT2A -PTD is associated with reduced OS.56  \nRUNX1 Mutations  \nThe RUNX1  gene, encoding a myeloid transcription factor, is mutated in \napproximately 10% of de novo  AML cases and is associated with \nadverse prognoses.24,109,110 In a study of adult patients with newly \ndiagnosed AML (n = 2439), RUNX1  mutations were associated with age  \n≥60 years , male  gender, more immature morphology, and secondary \nAML evolving from MDS.110 RUNX1  mutations frequently co -occurred \nwith epigenetic modifiers ASXL1 , IDH2 , KMT2A , and EZH2 .110 In a study \nexamining the impact of multiple RUNX1  mutations and loss of wild -type \nRUNX1  in AML, both loss of wild -type RUNX1 (OS, 5 months) and \nhaving ≥1 RUNX1  mutation (14 months) had an adverse impact on \nprognosis compared to 1 RUNX1  mutation (22 months; P < .002 and \n.048, respectively).111   \nHowever, in a retrospective study comparing outcomes for patients who \nreceived intensive induction (n = 149)  vs. venetoclax/azacitidine  (n = \n143), the presence of a RUNX1  mutation favored venetoclax/azacitidine \nover intensive chemotherapy for CR/CRi rate ( P = .0397) and , in those \n≥65 years of age,  OS ( P = .0166 ).112 In a separate cohort propensity \nmatched for ELN risk group, HCT status, and age, RUNX1  mutation \nagain favored venetoclax/azacitidine over intensive chemotherapy for OS \n(P = .0125).

In patients  ≥60 years  of age , ASXL1  mutations were significantly \nassociated with wild -type NPM1 , FLT3 -ITD mutations, mutated CEBPA , \nand lower survival.115 A large series analyzing younger adult  patients \nwith AML (range, 18 –61 years) also observed that ASXL1  mutations \nwere associated with age  >61 years  (P = .0001) and decreased EFS and \nOS.120 In this study, ASXL1  mutations were also significantly associated \nwith RUNX1  (P = .0001).120 In another study analyzing biological and \nprognostic subgroups based on mutations in ASXL1, RUNX1 , DNMT3A , \nNPM1 , FLT3 , and TP53  in patients with AML -MRC  (n = 125), ASXL1  (n = \n26; 21%) and TP53  (n = 28; 22%) were independently associated with \nshorter OS ( HR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.40 –4.6; P = .002).121 A more recent  \nmeta -analysis of 10 studies, including 5816 patients with AML, also \nrevealed worse OS for patients ≥60 years with ASXL1 -mutated AML \ncompared to patients <60 years (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.34 –6.08; P = \n.006).122 TP53 Mutations  \nTP53  mutations have been reported in approximately 12%  to 13% of \nAML cases, and are associated with adverse risk and poor \noutcomes.23,123,124 TP53  mutations are also most common in AML with \ncomplex karyotype.123 However, in therapy -related AML, TP53  mutations \nare more frequently associated with monosomal karyotype, and with \nabnormalities in chromosomes 5 and 7.123 In therapy -related AML, the \nfrequency of TP53  mutations is approximately 23%.24 In a large analysis \nof different hematologic malignancies including 858 AML cases, TP53  \nmutations or deletions were observed in 7% and 1%, respectively, of the \nAML cases, and both TP53  mutations and deletions were observed in \n5% of the cases.124 TP53  mutations were significantly more frequently \nseen in patients ≥60 years  of age  when compared to patients <60 years \nof age (9% vs. 2 %; P < .001).124 Interestingly, compared to TP53  \ndeletions, TP53  mutations negatively impacted survival in AML (36 \nmonths vs. 9 months, respectively; P < .001), suggesting the importance \nof evaluating both TP53  mutation and deletion status.124 \nClassification and Prognostic Relevance of Gene Mutations  \nThe NCCN AML Panel adopted the 20 22 ELN recommendations for risk \nstratification.22 Therefore, both NCCN and the ELN classify patients with \nNK-AML, CBF -AML,  mutated NPM1  without FLT3 -ITD, or bZIP in -frame \nmutated CEBPA  as having favorable -risk disease  (see Risk Stratification \nby Biological Disease Factors for Patients with Non -APL AML  Treated with \nIntensive Induction Chemotherapy  in the algorithm).22,125 In the updated \n2022 ELN guidelines , FLT3 -ITD allelic ratio is no longer taken into \nconsideration ; thus, AML with FLT3 -ITD and no adverse -risk genetic \nlesions is categorized as intermediate -risk, regardless of NPM1  mutation \nstatus .22 The reasoning behind this change was multifactorial, in part due \nto standardization issues with the FLT3 -ITD allelic ratio assay, the impact PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

NPM1  mutations can occur \nconcurrently with FLT3 -ITD, and patients who have both genetic lesions \nhave an outcome more similar to those with isolated FLT3 -ITD \nmutations.44,50 Thus, NPM1  mutation confers favorable prognosis only in \nthe absence of FLT3 -ITD.57 Similarly, the benefit in OS outcomes seen \nwith CEBPA mutations seems to be lost in the presence of concurrent \nFLT3 -ITD.72 As previously mentioned , studies suggest that FLT3 -TKD in \nthe presence of FLT3 -ITD is associated with poorer prognosis. In contrast, \nFLT3 -TKD may be associated with an additional favorable prognosis in the presence of NPM1  or CEBPA  mutations.69 A systematic review and \nmeta -analysis in patients <60 years of age with NK -AML further \nestablished  the prognostic role of these markers.54 OS and RFS predicted \nunfavorable prognosis for FLT3 -ITD ( hazard ratio [ HR], 1.86 and 1.75, \nrespectively) and favorable prognosis for NPM1  (HR, 0.56 and 0.37, \nrespectively) and CEBPA  (HR, 0.56 and 0.42, respectively).  \nThe clinical significance of FLT3 mutations in patients with APL remains  \ncontroversial. FLT3 -ITD is associated with a higher incidence of several \nhematologic features associated with APL (eg, higher WBC count, \ndecreased fibrogen levels, higher Sanz risk score).126,127 However, there \nremains a paucity of data to support a correlation of FLT3 -ITD on OS and \nrate of relapse.126,128,129 Although mutation status alone may not reflect \npatient outcome, there was a trend for decreased OS and EFS with a \nhigher FLT3 -ITD mutational load suggesting that further studies are \nnecessary to elucidate the clinical significance of this mutation.129 \nConversely, FLT3 -TKD has not been associated with the hematologic \nfeatures of APL and studies do not show a correlation of FLT3 -TKD on \noutcome.126,127,129 -131  \nThe molecular markers discussed provide prognostic information that aid \nrisk stratification of patients with AML and may influence subsequent \ntreatment decisions. Research into basic leukemia biology using banked \nsamples from clinical trials may provide ke ys to altered cellular pathways, \nwhich may lead to new treatment options. Risk stratification incorporating \nmolecular data along with cytogenetics is summarized in the guidelines \n(see Risk Stratification by Biological Disease Factors for Patients with \nNon-APL AML  Treated with Intensive Induction Chemotherapy in the \nalgorithm).

Again, \nit is important for physicians to confer with the local pathologist on how to \noptimize sample collection from the time of diagnosis for future molecular \ndiagnostics in patients who h ave NK -AML or in other situations where \nmolecular analysis may refine the prognostic category.  \nFamilial Genetic Alterations in AML  \nRelative to sporadic cases of AML and MDS, t he prevalence of known \nfamilial acute leukemia and MDS syndromes is felt to be rare , but with \nincreasing recognition of germline mutations associated with \npredisposition to developing AML/MDS,  identifying these syndromes is \nimportant for optimal care of patients and their relatives.132-135 The NCCN \nPanel recommends additional molecular and genetic testing for heritable  \nhematologic malignancy predisposition in a subset of patients, particularly  \nin patients <50 years  of age  and those with a family history . A heritable \nhematologic malignancy predisposition syndrome may account for \ncytopenias with or without MDS in some patients, whether presenting to \npediatric or  adult care centers (eg, GATA2 deficiency syndrome, \nShwachman -Diamond syndrome, telomere biology disorders). Functional \nlaboratory stu dies and constitutional  (germline) genetic testing using large \nNGS panels to include genes listed on MDS -E in the NCCN Guidelines for \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes , whole exome or whole genome sequencing  \ncomplemented with in silico copy number variant (CNV) calling, and/or \nlaboratory analysis for CNVs, such as microarray testing, is recommended  \nfor certain patients. See Genetic Familial High -Risk Assessment: \nHereditary Myeloid  Malignancy Predisposition Syndromes (MDS -D) and \nGene Mutations  Associated with Hereditary Myeloid  Malignancy \nPredisposition Syndromes (MDS -E) in the NCCN Guidelines for \nMyelodysplastic Syndromes . Principles of Acute Myeloid Leukemia  Treatment   \nTreatment of acute leukemia has historically been divided into induction \nchemotherapy and postremission (eg, consolidation) therapy. The \ninduction strategy , intensive chemotherapy or lower -intensity \nchemotherapy  is influenced by individual patient characteristics such as \nfitness, presence of comorbid conditions affecting performance status, \npreexisting  myelodysplasia , and disease characteristics . For those eligible \nfor intensive chemotherapy, obtaining a remission is the first step in \ncontrolling the diseas e; however , it is also important for patients  to emerge \nfrom the induction phase in a condition to tolerate subsequent, more \nintensive treatments during consolidation  to achieve durable disease \ncontrol.  \nIn patients  fit for intensive induction therapy , strategies for consolidation \nare based on the potential risk of relapse, with patients  with higher  risk \ndisease  receiving more intensive therapy. Cytogenetic and molecular \nabnormalities are the most significant prognostic indicators; however, \nfailure to achieve remission after 1 cycle of induction therapy or high tumor \nburden, defined as a WBC count ≥40 x 109/L,26 are included as poor -risk \nfactors for long -term remission. Therefore, response is assessed based on \nBM morphology and cytogenetic and molecular responses taken at \nseveral points during the course of treatment (see Response Criteria \nDefinitions for Acute Myeloid Leukemia  and Monitoring During Therapy  in \nthe algorithm for definitions of CR and partial remission [PR] and disease \nrelapse). The use of flow cytometry and/or molecular methods to assess \nMRD is emerging as a novel determinant to assess the depth of  \ntherapeutic response at the time of morphologic remission in patients  with \nAML (see Role of MRD Monitoring ).

MS-18 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nFor patients who initiate treatment with lower intensity therapy, such as \nazacitidine plus venetoclax, and achieve response, allogeneic HCT or \ncontinuation of the lower intensity treatment regimen are subsequent \noptions.  \nAdditionally, best supportive care may be an appropriate choice for certain \npatients based on performance status, patient wishes, and disease \ncharacteristics.  \nIn some cases, patients who either received postremission therapy or \nthose who did not may experience relapse, usually within 6 to 9 months  \nFinally, all patients require attentive supportive care related to the \nunderlying leukemia (ie, tumor lysis syndrome  [TLS] ) and the adverse \neffects of chemotherapy (see Principles of Supportive Care  in the \nalgorithm).  \nManagement of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia  \nAPL is a particularly aggressive subtype of AML, comprising \napproximately 10% of AML cases. APL has a distinct morphology and \nclinical presentation that may be associated with a high early death rate \ndue to potentially fatal coagulopathy.136-138 In an analysis of data (from \n1992 –2007) from the National Cancer Institute SEER registry, the \nage-adjusted annual incidence rate of APL was 0.23 per 100,000 \npersons.139 The median age of APL diagnosis was 44 years, which is \nyounger than that of patients with AML (median age , 67 years ).139,140 APL \nis cytogenetically distinguished by the t(15;17) chromosomal translocation. \nThe translocation of the PML gene on chromosome 15 to the RAR A gene \non chromosome 17 [ie, t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1)] produces a PML::RAR A \nfusion gene that can be quantitatively monitored using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to document disease burden and to ultimately confirm \nmolecular remission. As further emphasis of the cytogenetic attribute of \nAPL, the 2016 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute \nleukemia changed the definition of APL from the cytogenetic criteria of \nt(15;17) to the molecular definition of “APL with PML::RARA ” to be \ninclusive of complex or cryptic rearrangements that lead to a functional \ntranscription factor.32 \nAPL may be de novo  or therapy -related. Some of the following attributes \nof therapy -related APL (t -APL) were highlighted in a systematic review: 1) \nthe average age of diagnosis is 47 years with a higher incidence in \nfemales ; 2) the risk significantly  declines 2 years after completion of \ntreatment for the primary antecedent disease; 3) breast cancer, \nhematologic malignancy, multiple sclerosis, and genitourinary malignancy \nare the most common antecedent diseases; 4) topoisomerase II inhibitors \nand RT have the highest risk associated with developing t -APL; 5) the \nclinicopathology of t -APL is not different from de novo APL; 6) the single \nmutation t(15;17) is most common; and 7) the remission rate of t -APL is \n80%, which is comparable to de novo APL.141 Therefore, t -APL and de \nnovo APL are treated similarly.  \nThe incorporation of all -trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and the use of risk \nstratification (based on WBC counts) in the management of APL has \nlargely improved outcomes for patients with this subtype.  The unique \nability of ATRA to produce differentiation in APL blasts can reverse the \ncoagulopathy, which is the major cause of death during induction. To \nminimize early induction mortality due to coagulopathy, patients with a \npresumptive diagnosis of APL b ased on morphology, immunophenotype, \nand/or coagulopathy with a positive disseminated intravascular \ncoagulation screen should promptly start ATRA.

The \ninitial clinical diagnosis of APL may be confirmed by FISH or PCR ideally \nin the peripheral blood and if not confirmed, ATRA may be discontinued \nand standard AML therapy initiated.  \nStudies have demonstrated the necessity of early recognition and prompt \ninitiation of ATRA based on a presumed diagnosis of APL to reduce the \nrate of early mortality. This is evidenced by early death rates below 10% \nreported for patients enrolled in clinical trials142-146 compared to the general \npopulation where early mortality rates are still in excess of 15%.139,147 -149 \nData from the SEER registry measured 2 -year survival and 30 -day \nmortality from 1977 to 2007 and found a 61% improvement in 3 -year \nsurvival per decade ( P = .001) but a consistent rate of 30 -day mortality \naveraging 20%.147 Education of heath care providers to identify the first \nsuspicion of APL may extend the improved outcomes seen in clinical trials \nto the general population if treatment is not delayed.   \nFor patients with APL being treated at a community center, collaboration \nwith a center with expertise has been shown to reduce induction \nmortality .150 In this prospective trial, seven physicians with an expertise in \nAPL at six academic lead centers created a simplified APL treatment \nalgorithm. When patients with suspected APL presented to community \ncenters, the APL experts provided community center physicians with a \nplan for an initial workup and therapy and were available for 24/7 support \nin the setting of complications or need for treatment modification. A total of \n202 patients (median age , 53 years; range , 18–91 years) were enrolled in \nthe study, 62 a t academic lead centers and 140 at community centers. \nInduction survival and 1-year OS were the same between patients treated \nat academic lead center s or community centers, at 97% and 94.5%, \nrespectively.  There is a high frequency of FLT3  mutations in APL. In a  systematic \nreview including 11 studies, FLT3 -ITD frequency in APL occurred in about \n12% to 38% of cases and FLT3 -TKD occurred in 2% to 20% of cases.151 \nData are inconsistent about whether FLT3 -ITD in APL results in a negative \nprognosis. Several studies support this association and further correlate \nFLT3 -ITD with higher WBC counts, lower platelet counts, and the \nexpression of the bcr3 PML::RARA  fusion transcript.151-155 However, data \nfrom other studies have not shown a correlation.65,156 It has been proposed \nthat the discrepancy between studies may be at least partially resolved by \nincorporation of a FLT3 -ITD/wild -type ratio to measure the effect on \nprognosis.129,157 Data showed that a ratio of >0.66 resulted in a shorter \n5-year RFS.157 Similarly, shorter EFS and OS were observed in patients \nwith a ≥0.5 ratio compared to patients with <0.5 (EFS, P = .029; OS, \nP = .084).129 In a retrospective study evaluating survival outcomes in \ncases of de novo  APL with FLT3 -ITD mutation, the presence of FLT3 -ITD \nmutation did not significantly impact OS (86% vs . 70%; P = .32) or EFS \n(86% vs . 70%; P = .33).155 While data may correlate with prognosis, there \ncurrently remains no change in treatment course depending on expression \nof FLT3 -ITD and no recommendation to utilize a FLT3  inhibitor .  \nInduction Therapy for Patients with APL  \nThe evolution of treatment strategies for APL, built on clinical observation \nand well -constructed clinical trials, represents one of the most rewarding \nsagas of modern hematology. An early study by a group in Shanghai \nreported a CR rate of 85% in response to single -agent ATRA.158 The first \nNorth American Intergroup study confirmed a 70% CR rate with \nsingle -agent ATRA, which was equivalent to rates obtained with \nconventional doses of cytarabine and daunorubicin.159,160 Induction \nregimens with ATRA combined with anthracyclines (with or without \ncytarabine) are associated with CR rates >90%, as demonstrated in PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

MS-20 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nseveral large cooperative group trials.161-164 Using ATRA -based induction \nregimens followed by consolidation with regimens containing either ATRA \nwith anthracyclines, or cytarabine with anthracyclines, >80% of patients \nwith APL can be cured of their disease.161,163 -165 ATRA with arsenic trioxide \n(ATO) has resulted in improved outcomes for patients with APL.166 Risk \nstratification is a major consideration in the treatment of APL (see APL: \nClassification and Treatment Recommendation  in the algorithm ).164 \nAlthough clinical trials may group patients into those with low -, \nintermediate -, or high -risk disease, the NCCN Panel categorizes patients \nwith APL as having low -risk disease (WBC count ≤10  x 109/L) or high -risk \ndisease (WBC count  >10 x 109/L). Patients with low -risk disease are \ntypically treated with less intensive consolidation regimens compared with \nregimens used for high -risk disease . \nThe French APL 93 trial compared sequential therapy of ATRA followed \nby chemotherapy (cytarabine and daunorubicin) with concurrent ATRA \nplus chemotherapy. CR rates were 92% in both arms, but the relapse rate \nat 2 years was 6% in the combined ATRA plus chem otherapy group \nversus 16% for the sequential group.143,167 Induction regimens were pared \ndown to ATRA and idarubicin (the AIDA schedule) in both the Italian \nGIMEMA 93 trial and the Spanish PETHEMA LPA 94 trial, which produced \nCR rates of 89% to 95%, raising the question of whether there was a need \nfor cytarabine in APL induction.142,146 In these trials, 51 % to 61% of \nevaluable patients achieved PCR -negative status for PML::RARA  \nfollowing induction therapy; 93% to 98% were PCR -negative after \nconsolidation. The estimated 2 -year EFS rate was 79% in both trials.142,146 \nIn the PETHEMA trial, the 2 -year OS rate was 82%.146  \nFollowing observational data that correlated elevated WBC counts and \nhigh-risk disease (based on both the higher number of deaths during induction and the increased rates of relapse), in the PETHEMA LPA 94 \ntrials, Sanz et al168,169 devised a risk stratification study based solely on \nWBC and platelet counts at presentation. In this study, the induction \nregimen remained the same (AIDA), but ATRA was added to consolidation \ncycles 1 to 3 for all but  patients with low -risk disease (ie, WBC ≤10 x 109/L \nand platelets >40  x 109/L). The CR rate in this trial was 90% , with inability \nto achieve CR in the remaining 10% mostly  attributed  to hemorrhage, \ninfection, or differentiation syndrome. Factors predictive of death during \ninduction were a WBC  count >10 x 109/L, age >60 years, creatinine ≥1.4, \nand male sex.168,169 In 2006, Ades et al170 reported the outcome of the \nFrench APL 2000 trial (n  = 340) in which patients <60 years of age with \nWBC counts <10 x 109/L were randomized  to receive ATRA (45 mg/m2) \nand daunorubicin (60 mg/m2/day for 3 days) as induction therapy with or \nwithout cytarabine (200 mg/m2/day for 7 days). Those randomized to \ncytarabine for induction also received cytarabine during consolidation.170 \nPatients with WBC counts >10 x 109/L or age >60 years received \ncytarabine. While the CR rates were similar between the randomized \ngroups (99% with cytarabine and 94% without cytarabine), those receiving \ncytarabine had a lower 2 -year cumulative incidence of relapse (5% with \ncytarabine and 16% without cytarabine) that translated into an improved \nEFS rate (93% with cytarabine and 77% with no cytarabine) at 2 years. \nThe 2 -year OS rate was 98% with cytarabine and 90% without cytarabine. \nAmong patients with a WB C count >10 x 109/L, the CR rate was 97%; the \n2-year EFS rate was 89% for those <60 years of age and 79% for those \n>60 years of age.170 A report of a joint analysis of the outcomes in the \nPETHEMA 99 and the French APL 2000 trials in patients <65 years of age \nshowed that in patients with a WBC count <10 x 109/L, CR rates were \nsimilar, but the relapse rates at 3 years were lower in the PETHEMA trial, \nwhich used AIDA and no cytarabine during induction (with ATRA during \nconsolidation), than in the APL 2000 cytarabine -containing regimen (4% PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Time to hematologic \nresponse was more rapid and RFS (after a median follow -up of 18 \nmonths) was improved with the combination regimen compared with the \nmonotherapy regimens.173 Subsequently, Estey et al174 used a similar \ncombination of ATRA and ATO to treat patients with low -risk APL.174 \nPatients with h igh-risk disease in the same study were treated with ATRA \nand ATO combined with gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO; 9 mg/m2 on day 1 \nof induction therapy). In a report from this study (n  = 82), the CR rate in all \npatients was 92% (95% for low -risk and 81% for high -risk disease ) and the \nestimated 3 -year OS rate was 85%.175 The authors suggested that ATRA \ncombined with ATO, with or without GO, may be an alternative to \nconventional chemotherapy in patients with untreated APL. A subsequent \nstudy examined the long -term outcomes of patients with newly diagnosed \nAPL treated with ATRA and ATO with or without GO [9 mg/m2 on day 1 of \ninduction therapy for high -risk APL patients] (n = 187; median age, 50 \nyears; range, 18 –84 years).176 The CR rate was 96% for patients with both low- and high -risk APL. With a median follow -up of 47.6 months (range, \n2.7–159.7 months), the 5 -year EFS, DFS, and OS rates for patients with \nlow-risk disease  were 87%, 99%, and 89%, respectively, and for the \npatients with high-risk disease  were 81%, 89%, and 86%, respectively.176 \nThese data suggested that ATRA and ATO combined with GO is feasible \nand elicits durable responses. In another study by Es tey et al,177 patients \nwith APL were treated with ATRA and GO (9 mg/m2 on day 1 or 5 of \ninduction therapy). Patients with WBC counts of >30  x 109/L also received \nidarubicin (12 mg/m2/day on days 1 –3). In this study (n = 19), the CR rate \nin all patients who received ATRA  plus GO and idarubicin  was 84%, and \n88% in patients who received ATRA plus GO.177 However, clinicians \nshould be aware of possible adverse events associated with GO including \nsinusoidal obstruction syndrome  (SOS)  similar to which is  described in the \ntransplant setting.178,179  \nA phase II study (APML4) from Australia/New Zealand evaluated an \ninduction regimen with ATO added to a backbone of AIDA in patients with \npreviously untreated APL (n  = 124; median age, 44 years).180 Patients \nreceived 1 cycle of induction therapy with ATRA (45 mg/m2 days 1 –36 in \ndivided doses), age -adjusted idarubicin (6 –12 mg/m2 days 2, 4, 6, and 8), \nand ATO (0.15 mg/kg days 9 –36 as a 2 -hour IV infusion). All patients \nreceived prednisone (1 mg/kg/d ay for at least 10 days) regardless of initial \nWBC count as prophylaxis for differentiation syndrome.180 The most \ncommon grade 3 or 4 non -hematologic adverse events during induction \nincluded infections (76%; including febrile neutropenia), hepatic toxicity \n(44%), gastrointestinal toxicity (28%), metabolic abnormalities (16%), and \nprolonged QTc interval (14%); grade 3 or 4 differentiation syn drome \noccurred in 14% of patients.

The he matologic CR rate after induction was 95%; \nearly death (during induction) occurred in 3% of patients. The 2 -year DFS \nand failure -free survival rates were 97.5% and 88%, respectively. The \n2-year OS rate was 93%.180 This trial enrolled 24 patients who were \nconsidered to have high-risk disease per the Sanz criteria. OS was not \naffected by the Sanz risk group ( P[trend] = .17), although a correlation was \nmade with the failure -free survival rate ( P[trend] = .03). This association may \nbe attributed to the method of analysis that included patients who withdrew \nfrom the study due to  declining  treatment or excessive toxicity, as well as \npatients who had relapse, death, or who were unable to achieve a \nmolecular CR.  \nIn a phase III randomized trial of the Italian -German  Cooperative Group, \ninduction with ATRA combined with ATO was compared with the AIDA \nregimen in patients with newly diagnosed, low -, or intermediate -risk APL \n(n = 162; APL0406 study).166 Patients in Arm A received ATRA (45 mg/m2) \nplus ATO (0.15 mg/kg) daily until CR, then ATO 5 days per week for 4 \nweeks every 8 weeks for a total of 4 courses, and ATRA daily for 2 weeks \nevery 4 weeks for a total of 7 courses. Patients in Arm B received \nstandard AIDA induction followed by consolidation with 3 cycles of \nanthracycline -based consolidation combined with ATRA and then \nmaintenance comprising low -dose chemotherapy and ATRA.165 In \naddition, all patients received prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/d ay from day 1 until \nthe end of induction)  as prophylaxis for differentiation syndrome. The \nprimary endpoint of this study was the 2 -year EFS rate. Among patients \nwith evaluable data (n = 156), CR rates were not different between Arm A and Arm B (100% vs. 95%). After a median follow -up period of 34.4 \nmonths, the 2 -year EFS rate was significantly higher in Arm A compared \nwith Arm B (97% vs. 86%; P < .001 for non -inferiority; P = .02 for \nsuperiority). The 2 -year OS probability was also significantly higher in Arm \nA compared with Arm B (99% vs. 91%; P = .02). Four patients in Arm B \ndied during induction therapy (2 deaths were caused by differentiation \nsyndrome). One patient in Arm A and 3 patients in Arm B died during \nconsolidation. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia lasting >15 \ndays were significantly more frequent in Arm B compared with Arm A \nthroughout induction and consolidation cycles. Grade 3 or 4 hepatic \ntoxicities also occurred more frequently in Arm A compared with Arm B \n(63% vs. 6%; P < .001).166 Health -related quality -of-life outcomes were not \nsignificantly different between treatment groups except for fatigue severity. \nThere was improvement in fatigue following induction in the ATRA plus \nATO group ( P = .022), though the benefit was negligible by third \nconsolidation ( P = .660).181 This randomized study showed noninferiority \nof an ATRA plus ATO regimen compared with AIDA, which may allow for \nelimination of chemotherapy agents in the initial treatment of patients with \nnon–high-risk APL.  \nData from the randomized phase  III AML17 trial compared ATRA plus \nATO to AIDA in a cohort of 235 patients. ATRA was given to both groups \nin daily divided oral doses (45 mg/m2) until remission or until day 60, after \nwhich patients were treated 2 weeks on then 2 weeks off.182 The AIDA \ngroup received 4 cycles of consolidation consisting of 12 mg/m2 IV \nidarubicin on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 in the first course; 5 mg/m2 IV idarubicin \non days 1 through 4 in course 2; 10 mg/m2 mitoxantrone on days 1 \nthrough 4 in course 3; and 12 mg/m2 idarubicin on day 1 of the final \ncourse.182 The ATRA plus ATO treatment entailed 0.3 mg/kg IV ATO on \ndays 1 through 5 in the first week and 0.25 mg/kg twice weekly in weeks 2 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Patients with h igh-risk disease  could receive an initial \ndose of GO (6 mg/m2 IV). Comparison between the ATRA plus ATO group \nand the AIDA group showed a higher 4 -year EFS (91% vs. 70%; P = .002) \nand lower 4 -year cumulative incidence of morphologic relapse (1% vs. \n18%; P = .0007) for ATRA plus ATO compared to AIDA, though no \nstatistically significant difference in 4 -year survival was seen (93% vs. \n89%; P = .25). Quality of life was equivalent in the treatment groups for \nboth patients with high- and low -risk disease as measured by the primary \noutcome of global functioning (effect size, 2.17; 95% CI, -2.79 to 7.12; \nP = .39).182 However, the data from the trial measured more supportive \ncare treatments and higher liver toxicity with AIDA. Treatment schedule \ndiffered from previous trials by moving to a higher dose of ATO given at a \nlower frequency of twice weekly. Though data are l imited to this single \ntrial, the NCCN AML Panel recognizes that this alternative dosing \nschedule may be more manageable for patients who have difficulty getting \nto the clinic.  \nAll five induction regimens discussed above offer excellent outcomes. \nThese regimens are ATRA plus ATO (0.15 mg/kg; with the addition of \nidarubicin for patients with high-risk disease only); ATRA plus \ndaunorubicin (50 mg/m2 daily for 4 days) plus cytarabine; ATRA plus \ndaunorubicin (60 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) plus cytarabine; AIDA; or ATRA \nplus ATO (0.3 mg/kg). Choice of regimen will be influenced by risk group, \nfitness , and cardiovascular risks.  \nNCCN Recommendations for Induction Therapy for Patients with APL  \nThe NCCN AML Panel recommends that patients with APL be treated \naccording to one of the regimens established from the clinical trials; \nimportantly, one should use a regimen consistently through all components of the protocol and not mix induction regimens from one trial \nwith consolidation regimens from another trial. With the advances in \ntreatment regimens, the Panel emphasizes the importance of receiving \ntreatment from an established treatment center for the monitoring and \ntreatment of adverse events, rega rdless of risk stratification. However, as \npreviously noted, for patients with APL being treated at a community \ncenter, collaboration with a center with expertise has been shown to \nreduce induction mortality.150 The recommendations within the guidelines \nare broken down by: 1) risk classification using WBC count (cutoff of 10  x \n109/L) at diagnosis; and 2) whether patients with high-risk disease have \ncardiac issues. It is important for the management of APL that regimens \ncontaining ATRA and ATO be administered unless there is a \ncontraindication based on extenuating patient circumstances.  \nFor patients  with low -risk disease  (WBC counts ≤10 x 109/L), for initial \ninduction the Panel recommends ATRA plus daily ATO (0.15 mg/kg)166; or \nATRA plus intermittent ATO (0.3 mg/kg)182 as category 1, preferred \nregimen  options . If ATO is contraindicated or not available, the Panel \nrecommends  AIDA  (ATRA + idarubicin)164 (category 1);  ATRA plus a \nsingle dose of GO (6 or 9 mg/m2 on day 5)177,182; or enrollment in a clinical \ntrial.  \nFor patients with high -risk disease (WBC counts >10  x 109/L), the NCCN \nAML Panel historically recommended a regimen that included cytarabine \nalong with ATRA plus daunorubicin (PETHEMA LPA 99 trial) over AIDA \n(APL 2000 trial) because of higher CR and 3 -year OS rates.162,164 To \nimprove patient outcome, the PETHEMA LPA 99 trial and the GIMEMA \nAIDA -0493 study were modified to incorporate the combination of ATRA \nwith cytarabine either during induction (LPA 2005)164 or during \nconsolidation (AIDA -2000).165 The improved outcomes in both of these PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

MS-24 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nstudies suggest a supra -additive effect with ATRA plus cytarabine, \nindependent of the anthracycline. The APML4 trial has shown the benefit \nof induction that includes ATRA and ATO. Unlike the other regimens, the \nAPML4 trial does not use cytarabine during induction. In light of the se \nstudies, the Panel recommends initial induction with these preferred \nregimens: ATRA and idarubicin and ATO,180 or ATRA and either daily or \nintermittent ATO with a single dose of GO (9176 mg/m2 or 6182 mg/m2 that \nmay be given on day 1, day 2, day 3 , or day 4). Other recommended \nregimens include ATRA plus daunorubicin and cytarabine160,162,163; AIDA \nalone164; or enrollment in a clinical trial.  \nIn patients with high-risk disease with cardiac issues that include low \nejection fraction, the Panel recommends initial induction with ATRA and \neither daily or intermittent ATO with a single dose of GO (9 mg/m2 on day \n1176 or 6 mg/m2 on day 1182). If the patient with high-risk disease  develops \na prolonged QTc F, the Panel recommends initial induction with ATRA and \na single dose of GO 9 mg/m2177 or 6 mg/m2182 on day 1 ; ATRA plus \ndaunorubicin and cytarabine160,162; or AIDA alone.164 For cytarabine -\ncontaining regimens, dose adjustments of cytarabine may be needed for \npatients >60 years of age or those with renal dysfunction.  \nThe sudden onset of differentiation syndrome and the severity of the \ncomplications have resulted in the frequent use of preemptive \ndexamethasone, because there are no markers to predict its development. \nThe Panel recommends the prophylactic administration of corticosteroids \nin patients with a WBC count >10 x 109/L (or in patients receiving induction \nwith both ATRA and ATO, regardless of WBC count) to prevent \ndifferentiation syndrome. The ATRA plus ATO regimens defined by \nLo-Coco et al166 or Iland et al180,183 use prednisone 0.5 mg/kg as \nprophylaxis for differentiation syndrome but with differing durations and tapering schedules. For patients who develop differentiation syndrome on \nthese regimens despite prednisone prophylaxis, prednisone should be \nstopped and replaced with dexamethasone 10 mg twice daily (see \nPrinciples of  Supportive Care  for APL  in the algorithm). If using non -ATO \nregimens, either steroid regimen is acceptable although there may be a \nslight preference for dexamethasone for high -risk disease. W hile the Panel \nrecommends the use of prophylactic corticosteroids, it is acknowledged \nthat corticosteroids may not be necessary in all patients  and that the \noptimal duration of steroid prophylaxis is unknown . Some institutions may \nadvocate a low threshold for initiating corticosteroids instead of defaulting \nto prophylaxis. Until more studies are done to address this issue, \nconsistency to the selected protocol should be sought.  \nConsolidation Therapy for Patients with APL  \nBecause the differentiating action of ATRA occurs over a longer time \nperiod than the cytoreduction of conventional chemotherapy, early marrow \nevaluations for hematologic response at days 7 to 14 post induction are \nmisleading and may lead to overtreatment. Marrow evaluation is not \nrecommended until recovery of blood counts, usually 4 to 6 weeks after \ninduction. Cytogenetic analysis is usually normal by this point, but \nmolecular remission often requires at least 2 cycles of consolidation. Thus, \nthe first asse ssment of molecular remission should not be performed prior \nto count recovery. At count recovery following induction therapy, patients \nshould proceed with consolidation . For patients with low -risk disease, if a \npatient is cytopenic on days 28  to 35, BM biopsy and aspirate is \nrecommended to document <5% blasts and no abnormal promyelocytes  \nand to assess whether the  marrow is suppresse d and to determine  \nwhether  ATRA  and ATO should be held  to allow count recovery .

For patients with high -risk disease, LP \nshould be considered at count recovery following induction therapy, before \nproceeding with consolidation.184 Many consolidation regimens involve \nhigh cumulative doses of cardiotoxic agents. It is therefore important to \nassess the cardiac function of patients prior to initiating each \nanthracycline - or mitoxantrone -containing consolidation cycle. \nConsolidation regimens using ATO will require monitoring of the QTc \ninterval and optimizing electrolytes (see Principles of  Supportive Care  for \nAPL in the algorithm and Supportive Care for Patients with APL in the \ndiscussion).  \nAccording to the package insert, for QTc >450 msec for males and 460 \nmsec for females , corrective measures should be initiated and \nreassessment with serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) should be performed \nprior to ATO treatment.   \nThe goal of consolidation therapy for APL is a durable molecular \nremission. Data from the two sequential PETHEMA trials,146,168,169 which \nproduced the current risk model, were used to construct subsequent trials \nthat intensify therapy for the high -risk groups. In the second PETHEMA \ntrial (LPA 99), 15 days of ATRA (45 mg/m2) were added to each of 3 \ncycles of anthracycline -based consolidation therapy. Overall, relapse rates \nwere reduced from 20% to 9% with the incorporation of ATRA in the \nconsolidation phase.168 For the low -risk group, there was no difference in \nrelapse rate (3% –6%) or in 3 -year DFS rate (93% –97%) between the \nATRA group compared with a similar consolidation without ATRA in the \nLPA 94 trial.168 Among patients with intermediate -risk disease , the relapse \nrate was reduced from 14% to 2.5% with the incorporation of ATRA; the \n3-year DFS rate was 97% with ATRA consolidation versus 82% in \nhistorical controls.168 Although the addition of ATRA to the high -risk group improved relapse and DFS rates, there were significant rates of relapse \n(26%) and 3 -year DFS (77%). In the PETHEMA LPA 2005 study, both \nATRA and cytarabine were included in the anthracycline -containing \nconsolidation regimen for the patients with high-risk disease .164 In this \nhigh-risk group, the 3 -year relapse rate was reduced to 11% (compared \nwith 26% from the LPA 99 study), and the 3 -year DFS and OS rates were \n82% and 79%, respectively. The LPA 2005 trial also began to approach \nthe question of how to reduce toxicity during consolidation therapy in \npatients with low- and intermediate -risk disease by dose reduction of \nmitoxantrone (from 10 mg/m2/day for 5 days to 10 mg/m2/day for 3 days in \ncycle 2) and a small reduction of idarubicin dose for low - and \nintermediate -risk groups (from 7 mg/m2/day for 4 days to 5 mg/m2/day for \n4 days in cycle 1 and from 2 doses of 12 mg/m2/day to 1 dose of 12 \nmg/m2/day in cycle 3). Based on results in the low - and intermediate -risk \ngroups, lowering the dose of mitoxantrone resulted in reduction of toxicity \nand hospital stay while maintaining the anti -leukemic activity (compared \nwith results in low - and intermediate -risk g roups from the LPA 99 study). \nWith the consolidation regimens evaluated in the LPA 2005 study, \noutcomes were similar between low -risk and intermediate -risk groups with \nregard to the 3 -year cumulative incidence of relapse (6% vs. 6%), the \n3-year DFS (93% vs. 94%), and the 3 -year OS rate (96% vs. 93%).164  \nThe AIDA -2000 trial of the Italian GIMEMA group has confirmed that \ninclusion of ATRA in consolidation significantly improved outcome, most \nnotably for patients with high-risk disease ; the high -risk group received a \nconsolidation regimen containing ATRA and cytarabine along with \nanthracyclines.165 In this study, the 6 -year cumulative incidence of relapse \nwas 9% for patients in the high -risk group; the 6 -year DFS and OS rates in \nthis group were 84.5% and 83%, respectively.

For patients in the low - and intermediate -risk group, the 6 -year \ncumulative incidence of relapse was 11%; the 6 -year DFS and OS rates in \nthis group were 86% and 89%, respectively.165 \nIn the European APL 2000 trial, which randomized daunorubicin with or \nwithout cytarabine for the consolidation phase (no ATRA during \nconsolidation) for the low - and intermediate -risk (ie, “standard risk”) \ngroups, the 2 -year EFS rate was higher with the addition of cytarabine.170 \nLong -term follow -up from this study showed that in patients with standard -\nrisk disease , the addition of cytarabine substantially reduced cumulative \nincidence of relapse (7 -year relapse rate , 13% vs. 29%; P = .0065) and \nincreased 7 -year EFS rates (83% vs. 65%; P = .0029) compared with the \nregimen without cytarabine.185 A poorer response was seen in patients \nwho did not receive cytarabine despite maintenance treatment of \ncontinuous 6 -mercaptopurine plus methotrexate and intermittent ATRA. \nFurthermore, all patients with high-risk disease received cytarabine during \ninduction and consolidation resulting in a 7 -year relapse rate, EFS rate, \nand OS rate of 7.1%, 82.2%, and 87.6%, respectively, an outcome that \nwas slightly improved over patients with standard -risk disease treated \nwithout cytarabine. Although the results of the E uropean APL 2000 trial \nare limited by the use of a single anthracycline in all study arms, the data \nsupport the use of cytarabine in standard -risk APL with the anthracycline \ndaunorubicin.  \nThe North American Intergroup trial also focused on decreasing toxicity \nduring consolidation by incorporating ATO into the consolidation schema directly after achieving remission.163 In this trial, patients who were \nrandomized to receive 2 courses of 25 days of ATO (5 days a week for 5 \nweeks) immediately after entering CR followed by the standard \npost-remission regimen with 2 more courses of ATRA plus daunorubicin, \nhad a significantly higher 3 -year EFS rate (80% vs. 63%; P < .0001) and \nimproved OS outcomes (3 -year OS rate , 86% vs. 81%; P = .06) compared \nwith those who received only the 2 courses of ATRA plus chemotherapy. \nThe 3 -year DFS rate was also significantly improved with the add ition of \nATO (90% vs. 70%; P < .0001). The favorable outcomes with the \nincorporation of ATO were observed in patients with low -/intermediate -risk \nand high -risk disease.163 Notably, in the high -risk group, DFS outcomes \nwith the addition of ATO were similar to the DFS rate observed for the \nlow-/intermediate -risk group, suggesting that ATO may help to overcome \nthe negative prognostic influence of high -risk disease. The overall \noutcomes do not appear to be superior to the less complex consolidation \nschedules used in either of the two most recent European trials for \npatients in the low - and intermediate -risk groups, but did appear to offer \nimproved survival for patients with high -risk disease. However, the \nconsolidation phase in the North American Intergroup protocol is longer \nand may be difficult for some patients to complete.  \nThe French APL 2006 randomized trial evaluated the role of ATO in \nconsolidation therapy for previously untreated APL, both for patients with \nstandard -risk disease  (WBC count <10  x 109/L; ATO  vs. cytarabine vs. \nATRA, all in combination with idarubicin during consolidation) and patients \nwith high-risk disease (WBC >10  x 109/L; cytarabine vs. ATO + cytarabine, \nboth in combination with idarubicin during consolidation).186,187 Based on \nresults from the interim analysis (median follow -up, 22 –24 months), all \nregimens resulted in CR rates exceeding 95% with low rates of relapse. \nHowever, the use of ATO in the consolidation phase was associated with PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Data from this analysis show a \n99.4% CR across all groups encompassing a total of 347 patients.187 \nWhile the 2-year EFS and OS rates were >95% for all three groups, there \nwas a reduction of myelosuppression in the group treated with AIDA \ncompared to idarubicin plus cytarabine and idarubicin plus ATO, which \nhad similar durations.187 The potential benefits of the use of ATO or ATRA \nin consolidation may rest in a lower risk for long -term cardiovascular \ncomplications and a lower risk for secondary myelodysplasia.  \nIn the phase II APML4 study from Australia/New Zealand, 2 cycles of ATO \nand ATRA were used as consolidation in patients who achieved a CR after \na 3-drug induction with ATRA, idarubicin, and A TO.180 Among the patients \nwho proceeded to consolidation (n  = 112), all achieved molecular \nremission, and the 2 -year DFS rate was 97.5%. The 2 -year OS rate in all \npatients  with evaluable data  in this study (n  = 124) was 93%.180 As \ndiscussed earlier, in the phase III randomized trial of ATRA combined with \nATO versus the AIDA regimen (APL0406 study) in patients with newly \ndiagnosed, low -, or intermediate -risk APL (n  = 162), patients in the ATRA \nplus ATO arm received consolidation with ATO 5 days per week for 4 \nweeks every 8 weeks for a total of 4 courses, and ATRA daily for 2 weeks \nevery 4 weeks for a total of 7 courses (Arm A).166 Patients in the AIDA arm \n(Arm B) received 3 cycles of anthracycline -based consolidation combined \nwith ATRA and then maintenance with low -dose chemotherapy and \nATRA.165 After a median follow -up period of 31 months, the 2 -year EFS \nrate was significantly longer in Arm A compared with Arm B (97% vs. 86%; \nP < .001 for noninferiority; P = .02 for superiority of ATRA -ATO). In \naddition, the 2 -year OS was also longer in Arm A (99% vs. 91%; P = .02), with no differences in 2 -year DFS (97% vs. 90%; P = .11) or cumulative \nincidence of relapse (1% vs. 6%; P = .24) between treatment arms.166  \nIn the French APL 93 trial , a 4% incidence of CNS relapse was reported in \npatients with WBC counts >10 x 109/L. In the APL 2000 trial, that high -risk \npopulation received five doses of IT chemotherapy using a combination of \nmethotrexate, cytarabine, and steroids, upon count recovery following \ninduction therapy. These patients also received a higher dose of \ncytarabine (2 g/m2) during consolidation (in cycle 2) as compared with 1 \ng/m2 in the APL 93 trial. There were no cases of CNS relapse in the APL \n2000 trial, compared with 5 cases in the APL 93 trial. While the original \ntreatment protocol on APL 2000 used  high-dose cytarabine  (HiDAC ) in the \nsecond cycle of consolidation, some investigators suggest the use of \nHiDAC earlier, particularly in those patients who are not rece iving IT \ntherapy for CNS prophylaxis.  \nNCCN Recommendations for Consolidation  Therapy for Patients with APL  \nFor patients with low-risk disease , the NCCN AML Panel has positioned \nthe ATRA plus ATO regimen first, based on results from the APL0406 \nphase III randomized trial in comparison with the AIDA regimen.166 An \nadditional ATRA plus ATO regimen based on the AML 17 trial182 is also a \npreferred option. The GIMEMA AIDA -2000 regimen165 is an additional \noption. However, all three of these regimens will yield excellent results. It \nis important to note that clinicians should use a regimen consistently \nthrough all components of the treatment protocol and not mix induction \nregimens from one trial with consolidation regimens from another trial. It is \nalso important for the management of APL that regimens containing ATRA \nand ATO be administered unless there is a contraindication based on \nextenuating  patient circumstances.

If the patient received ATRA and GO as \ninduction therapy, consolidation with ATRA and GO should follow.177 As \nmentioned previously, the Panel suggests that a regimen should be used \nconsistently through all components and physicians should not mix \ninduction therapy from one trial with consolidation therapy from another.  For patients with high-risk APL, IT chemotherapy  (eg, 2 doses for each \nconsolidation cycle)  can be considered  for CNS prophylaxis . IT \nchemotherapy may include agents such as methotrexate alternating with \ncytarabine either alone or combined with corticosteroids; the choice of \nsingle drug versus combinations may vary based on clinical situation and \ninstitutional practice. Usually IT chemotherapy is started at the completion \nof induction and then given at the start and at count recovery on \nsubsequent consolidations. IT chemotherapy can be omitted during cycles \nof higher dose cytarabine.   \nPost -Consolidation or Maintenance for Patients with APL  \nFollowing consolidation therapy, patients are assessed for molecular \nremission using RT -PCR techniques on BM samples. For patients who \nachieve PCR negativ ity, a 1- to 2-year course of ATRA maintenance \ntherapy, which may be combined with 6 -mercaptopurine and \nmethotrexate, may be a reasonable approach. The recommendations for \nmaintenance ATRA arose from several early trials that showed superior \nRFS for patients receiving ATRA alone or in combination as maintenance \ntherapy. The French APL 93 t rial randomized e ligible patients (n  = 289) to \nfour different maintenance regimens: no maintenance, continuous \nchemotherapy with 6 -mercaptopurine and methotrexate, intermittent \nATRA, and the combination of ATRA with 6 -mercaptopurine and \nmethotrexate.143 Results showed decreased 2 -year relapse rates with \ncontinuous chemotherapy (11.5% vs. 27% with no chemotherapy) and \nwith ATRA (13.5% vs. 25% with no ATRA). The estimated 2 -year relapse \nrate for patients who received maintenance with ATRA in combination with \nchemotherapy was 7.4%, suggesting an additive benefit with the \ncombination.

The 5 -year DFS rates for the four randomization \ngroups, chemotherapy induction plus observation, chemotherapy induction \nplus ATRA maintenance, AT RA induction plus observation, and ATRA \ninduction plus ATRA maintenance, were 16%, 47%, 55%, and 74%, respectively.160 Thus, the incorporation of ATRA during induction and \nmaintenance appeared to improve long -term remission durations. It should \nbe noted that in the above North American Intergroup trial, molecular \nremission status was not assessed prior to randomization to maintenance \ntreatment.  \nThe Japanese APL 97 randomized study evaluated the role of \nmaintenance with intensified chemotherapy compared with observation in \npatients with APL who were in molecular remission following consolidation \n(n = ).188 The estimated 6 -year DFS was not significantly different between \nthe chemotherapy maintenance and observation arms (63% vs. 80%). In \nfact, the estimated 6 -year OS was significantly lower with maintenance \n(86% vs. 99%; P = .014), which the investigators attributed to possible \neffects of chemotherapy maintenance on the development of secondary \nmalignancies and responses to subsequent (second -line) therapies.188 \nData from the AIDA 0493 trial suggested that there was no long -term \nbenefit to maintenance therapy (ie, combination chemotherapy with \n6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, ATRA alone, or ATRA in combination \nwith chemotherapy) in patients who had achieved  molecular remission \n(PCR negativ ity) at the end of consolidation therapy.189 In this trial, ATRA \nwas not given during consolidation. The above studies have not \ndemonstrated long -term benefit with the use of maintenance therapy in \npatients who achieve molecular remission following consolidation therapy.  \nFurther data from randomized trials are needed to address the question of \nmaintenance. A phase III cooperative group trial (SWOG 0521) is \ndesigned to examine the need for maintenance therapy (using the \ncombination of ATRA, 6 -mercaptopurine, and methotrexate) in patients \nwith low -risk APL.

Patients are then randomized to \nreceive maintenance therapy or no further treatment (observation only). \nNo benefit for maintenance was observed.190 The benefit of maintenance \ntherapy likely depends on the regimens used during induction and \nconsolidation therapies. Therefore, it is important to use maintenance \ntherapy in conjunction with the treatment protocols in which they have \nbeen shown to confer benefit.  \nNCCN Recommendations for Post -Consolidation  or Maintenance  for \nPatients with APL  \nRT-PCR should be performed on a blood sample at completion of \nconsolidation to document molecular remission. It is at the discretion of the \ntreating physician to determine the appropriate frequency of monitoring for \nindividual patients. In patients receiving the ATRA/arsenic regimen, earlier \nsampling at 3  to 4 months during consolidation may be considered.  \nWhile long -term moni toring has been standard, with newer, more effective  \nregimens, the value is less certain. Periodic monitoring is recommended \nfor up to 2 years after completion of  treatment  to detect molecular  relapse \nin patients with high -risk disease, patients >60 years or who had long \ninterruptions during consolidation, or patients on regimens that use \nmaintenance and are not able to tolerate maintenance. Clinical experience \nindicates that the risk of relapse in patients with low -risk disease who are \nin molecular remission at completion of consolidation is low, and \nmonitoring may not be necessary outside the setting of a clinical trial. At \nthe current level of test sensitivity/specificity, a change from PCR negative \nto positive status should be confirm ed in a blood sample by a reliable \nlaboratory within 2 to 4 weeks. If molecular relapse is confirmed by a \nsecond positive test, the patient should be treated for relapsed disease \n(see APL:  Therapy for Relapse  in the algorithm). A prospective study that analyzed 6727 serial RT -PCR assays from patients with newly diagnosed \nAPL receiving ATRA and anthracycline -based induction therapy found that \nsequential RT -PCR monitoring was the strongest predictor of clinical \nrelapse ( P < .0001) and RFS ( P < .0001) .191 If the second test was \nnegative, maintenance therapy and frequent monitoring (eg, every 2 –3 \nmonths) for up to an additional 2 years is strongly recommended  to ensure \ncontinued PCR negativ ity. Testing should be done in the same laboratory \nto maintain a consistent level of sensitivity. Most clinical labs have a \nsensitivity level of 10-4. If results are equivocal, consultation with a \nphysician experienced in molecular diagnostics should  be considered. For \npatients who develop cytopenias and who have a negativ e RT -PCR, a BM \naspirate is recommended to assess for new cytogenetic abnormalities, as \nsecondary MDS and AML can occur following APL therapy.  \nManagement of Relapsed APL  \nATO is recommended for patients who do not achieve molecular remission \nat completion of consolidation or who subsequently demonstrate \nmolecular or morphologic relapse. As a single agent, ATO produced CR \nrates of 80% to 90% in patients with hematologic rela pse and achieved \nmolecular remissions in 70% to 80% of those patients.172,192 -194 In a \nretrospective analysis of patients with APL who  experienced  relapse after \nfirst-line therapy with ATRA combined with chemotherapy (n  = 23), \nreinduction therapy with ATO -containing regimens (ATO monotherapy, \nn = 20; ATO combined with ATRA and anthracycline, n  = 2; ATO \ncombined with mitoxantrone, n  = 1) resulted in hematologic CR in 95% \nand molecular remission in 83% of patients.195 ATRA and ATO appear to \nbe synergistic and one could consider using the combination in patients \nwho have not received ATRA during consolidation.171-173 However, in a \nsmall randomized study of patients with relapsed APL (n  = 20), all patients \npreviously treated with ATRA -containing chemotherapy showed no PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

A retrospective \nanalysis in a small number of patients reported a second CR rate of 93% \n(both for hematologic CR and molecular remission) among patients who \nwere ret reated with ATO combined with ATRA (with or without \nanthracyclines) after a relapse following first -line therapy with single -agent \nATO (n  = 14).195 A small multicenter study evaluated 22 patients with APL \ntreated with prolonged ATRA -ATO at the time of relapse and reported that \n90% of patients achieved molecular CR after 2 cycles.197 At a median \nfollow -up of 58 months, 4 -year OS probability was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.61 –\n0.94), DFS was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.49 –0.88), and EFS was 0.68 (95% CI, \n0.45–0.83).  \nFor patients with APL who experience relapse early (<6 months) after an \ninitial CR to first -line therapy with ATRA and ATO with no prior exposure to \nanthracyclines, anthracycline -based regimens (ATRA plus daunorubicin \nand cytarabine160,162,163; and AIDA alone164) are recommended. Single -\nagent GO is another option. In a study of 16 patients with relapsed APL, \nGO at a dose of 6 mg/m2 was administered for 2 doses, followed by a third \ndose for patients achieving a new molecular remission.198 Molecular \nremission  was achieved in 6 of 7  patients  tested after 1 dose, in 9 of 11 \npatients tested after 2 doses,  and in 13 of 13 patients tested after 3 doses . \nAmong the remaining 3 patients, 1 achieved molecular remission after \ndose 1 and received no additional doses due to hepatic toxicity and 2 \nexperienced molecular relapse  while receiving GO. Among patients who \nexperienced response, molecular responses were sustained for a median \nof 15 months in 7 of 14 (50%) patients, while the remaining 50% \nexperienced relapse from a range of 3  to 15 months. Among patients who  experienced relapse, 2 were retreated with GO and obtained new \nmolecular remissions. All patients e xperienced myelosuppression. The \nvoluntary withdrawal of the drug in 2010 was based on interim data from a \nrandomized trial in adult patients (aged 18 –60 years) with AML comparing \ninduction regimens of cytarabine and daunorubicin with or without GO in \nwhich there was no improvement in  outcomes and a small but significant \nincrease in early mortality in the GO arm.199 Subsequent results of this trial \neventually showed no difference in overall mortality between the two \narms .200 Since its withdrawal from the market, studies have demonstrated \na significant benefit for GO in specific patient populations. Therefore, GO \nhas been re -approved for AML. One complication to evaluating the benefit \nof GO is that APL occurs in a small population of patients, and therefore \nstudies do not have the numbers to enroll for a suitable trial. The benefit of \nGO must be weighed against the possibility  for adverse events. Clinicians \nshould be advised of the possible complication of SOS when administerin g \nGO. \nFor patients who experience an early relapse (<6 months) after an initial \nCR to ATRA and anthracycline -containing first -line regimens or with no \nprior exposure to ATO, it is recommended that the patient receive ATO \nwith or without ATRA, and with or without a single dose of GO until count \nrecovery with marrow confirms remission.  \nFor patients who experience  a late relapse ( ≥6 months) to ATO -containing \nregimens, ATO with or without ATRA, and with or without a n anthracycline \nor a single dose of GO , is recommended as first -line therapy after relapse. \nFollowing completion of the first cycle of consolidation, if the patient does \nnot enter molecular remission, a matched sibling or alternative donor \n(haploidentical, unrelated donor, or cord blood) HCT or clinical trial is PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Testing is recommended at least 2 to 3 weeks after the \ncompletion of ATO to avoid false positives.  \nA small phase II trial in patients with relapsed APL evaluated ATO during \ninduction and consolidation followed by a peripheral blood hematopoietic \ncell harvest after HiDAC  chemotherapy and autologous HCT.201 The study \nenrolled 35 patients ( 26 with hematologic relapse and 9 with molecular \nrelapse) between the ages of 18 and 65 years. The EFS after 1 year was \n77% (90% CI, 63% –86%). At a median follow -up of 4.9 years (range, 0.3 –\n6.3 years), the 5 -year EFS was 65% and the 5 -year OS was 77% with an \nestimated 59% probability of failure -free survival.201 The data suggest that \nthis sequential treatment regimen may provide improved outcomes with \ngreater duration.  \nA retrospective analysis conducted by the European APL Group showed \nthat in patients who received HCT following a second hematologic \nremission (primarily with ATRA -containing regimens), outcomes were \nmore favorable with autologous HCT (n  = 50) compared with allogeneic \nHCT (n  = 23). The 7 -year RFS (79% vs. 92%) and EFS (61% vs. 52%) \nrates did not reach statistical significance between patients who received \nautologous versus allogeneic HCT; however, 7 -year OS rates were \nsignificantly improved with autologous compared with allogeneic HCT \n(60% vs. 52%; P = .04).202 Among patients who received a PCR -negative \nautograft, the 7 -year RFS and OS rates were 87% and 75%, respectively. \nAlthough the relapse rates were low with allogeneic HCT, the reduced OS \nwith this procedure was accounted for by the higher treatment -related \nmortality observed in the allogeneic HCT group compared with the \nautologous HCT group (39% vs. 6%).202  A second study also suggested that autologous HCT could have a survival \nadvantage over allogeneic HCT in this population.203 Chakrabarty et al203 \nlooked at 294 patients who received either allogeneic (n  = 232) or \nautologous HCT (n = 62) between 1995 and 2006. The 5 -year DFS in the \nautologous HCT recipients was 63% (range, 49% –75%) versus 50% \n(range, 44% –57%) in patients receiving allogeneic HCT. Although the DFS \nwas not statistically significant ( P = .1), the difference in OS did reach \nstatistical significance ( P = .002). In the patients receiving autologous \nHCT, OS was 75% (range, 63% –85%) versus 50% (range, 48% –61%). \nThe authors attribute this ben efit to the increased treatment -related \nmortality seen with patients receiving allogeneic (30%) compared to \nautologous HCT (2%).  \nIt should be noted that only limited evidence from retrospective studies \nexist regarding  the role of autologous and allogeneic HCT following \nrelapse of APL in the era of ATO therapy. The optimal consolidation \nstrategy following therapy with ATO -containing regimens in patients with \nrelapsed disease remains to be defined.204 In a small retrospective study \nof patients with relapsed APL treated with ATO -containing induction and \nconsolidation therapy, outcome of further consolidation with autologous \nHCT was compared with maintenance (without autologous HCT) \nconsisting of ATO with or without ATRA.195 In this analysis, all patients had \nachieved second molecular remission following induction and \nconsolidation therapy with the ATO -containing regimens; subsequently, 14 \npatients underwent autologous HCT and 19 patients opted for an \nATO-containing maintenance regimen. Consolidation with autologous HCT \nwas associated with a significantly higher 5 -year EFS rate (83% vs. \n34.5%; P = .001) and OS rate (100% vs. 38.5%; P = .001) compared with \nATO-containing maintenance therapy.195 The authors concluded that \nconsolidation with autologous HCT was superior to ATO -containing PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Outcome data from the ELN registry reported a 3 -year OS after \ntransplant in second CR of 80% compared with 59% in patients without \ntransplant ( P = .03).205 \nA small percentage of relapsed APL has a CNS component.206,207 \nTherefore, for patients who are in second morphologic remission, the use \nof IT chemo therapy for CNS prophylaxis should be considered. Patients \nwho achieve a molecular remission after second -line therapy should be \nconsidered for autologous HCT if they do not have contraindications to \nhigh-dose therapy. Allogeneic HCT should be reserved for patients who \nhave persistent disease despite therapy for relapsed disease. For patients \nin second CR who have contraindications to HCT, continued therapy with \nATO for 6 cycles is recommended in the absence of a suitable clinical trial.  \nSupportive Care for Patients with APL  \nSpecific supportive care issues should be considered when treating \npatients with APL. Therapy for APL is often associated with a constellation \nof symptoms and physiologic abnormalities, including fluid retention, \ndyspnea, episodic hypotension, pulmonary in filtrates, and pulmonary or \npericardial effusions now referred to as “differentiation syndrome.” \nApproximately 15% to 25% of patients  who have not been previously \ntreated  receiving ATRA -containing therapy develop this syndrome.208,209 \nPatients may begin to develop evidence of differentiation syndrome early \nin the treatment with either ATRA or ATO as single agents or in \ncombination. These patients develop fever, often accompanied by rapidly \nrising WBC counts ( >10 x 109/L). Patients should be closely monitored for \nhypoxia and the development of  pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusion. \nDifferentiation syndrome along with hemorrhage are the leading causes of \ndeath during induction therapy. Early recognition and prompt initiation of cortic osteroids are key components in the management of this \ncomplication. In some studies, low mortality and morbidity rates were \nreported when corticosteroids were administered prophylactically in \npatients presenting with high WBC counts.168,210  Kelaidi et al211 assessed \nthe outcomes of patients with high WBC (>10  x 109/L) enrolled in the APL \n93 and APL 2000 trials.211 A fundamental difference between these two \ntrials was the use of dexamethasone (10 mg every 12 hours beginning on \nday 1) for patients on APL 2000. The early death rate from differentiation \nsyndrome dropped from 8 in 139 patients (6%) in the APL 93 trial t o 2 in \n133 patients (1.5%) in the APL 2000 trial.  \nThere should be a high index of suspicion for differentiation syndrome in \npatients with APL who may be triggered by symptoms including fever, an \nincreasing WBC count >10 x 109/L, shortness of breath, hypoxemia, and \npleural or pericardial effusion. Close monitoring of volume overload and \npulmonary status is warranted in these patients and initiation of \ndexamethasone should occur at the first signs or symptoms of respiratory \ncompromise (ie, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, pericardial or pleural \neffusions). The NCCN AML Panel recommends treating with \ndexamethas one 10 mg twice daily for 3 to 5 days, then tapering the dose \nover 2 weeks (see Principles of Supportive Care  for APL  in the algorithm). \nATRA may need to be withheld during the initial acute symptomatic period \nbut may be resumed when symptoms resolve. Othe r factors that have \nbeen reported to increase the risk of differentiation syndrome include a \nhigh body mass index and age >40 years. For patients at high risk (WBC \ncount >10  x 109/L) of developing differentiation syndrome, initiate \nprophylaxis with corticosteroids, either prednisone (0.5 mg/kg) from day 1 \nor dexamethasone 10 mg every 12 hours (see Principles of Supportive \nCare  for APL  in the algorithm). The steroid dose should be tapered over a \nperiod of several days.

In the Australia/New Zealand \nstudy that evaluated induction with ATO added to a backbone of AIDA \n(phase II APML4 trial), all patients received prednisone (1 mg/kg/d ay for at \nleast 10 days) as prophylaxis for differentiation syndrome regardless of \ninitial WBC count [see APL Treatment Induction (High Risk)  in the \nalgorithm ].180 In the Italian -German Cooperative Group  study that \nevaluated ATRA combined with ATO versus the AIDA regimen (phase III \nAPL0406 trial), patients received prophylaxis with prednisone (0.5 \nmg/kg/d ay) from day 1 until the end of induction [see APL Treatment \nInduction (Low Risk)  in the algorithm ].166 The optimal duration of steroid \nprophylax is unknown.  If a patient develops differentiation syndrome, it is \nrecommended that treatment be changed from prednisone to \ndexamethasone 10 mg every 12 hours until count recovery or risk of \ndifferentiation has abated.164,166 Hydroxyurea can be used to treat \nleukocytosis associated with differentiation syndrome. In difficult to treat \ncases, an anthracycline or GO can be used.  \nLeukapheresis is not routinely recommended in the management of high \nWBC counts in APL because of the difference in leukemia biology. A \nretrospective study analyzed 242 patients with APL, 12% of whom had a \nWBC >50 x 109/L at presentation.212 Of the 29 patients presenting with \nhyperleukocytosis, 11 (38%) underwent leukapheresis. There was no \nsignificant difference in CR rate (82% vs . 78%; P = .79) or 3 -year OS \n(73% vs . 67%; P = .64) in patients who underwent leukapheresis \ncompared to patients who did not undergo leukapheresis. However, in \ncases of potentially life -threatening leukostasis not responsive to other \nmodalities, leukapheresis can be considered with caution. Hydroxyurea \ncan be used to treat leukocytosis in individuals with low -risk di sease who \nexperience a rise in WBC count after treatment with an ATRA/ATO -based \nregimen.  Because coagulopathy is common in patients with APL, it is important to  \nscreen for this problem with evaluation of PT, PTT, and fibrinogen \nconcentration during the initial workup and before any invasive procedure. \nClinical coagulopathy is managed by aggressive transfusion support to \nmaintain platelet counts of ≥50 x 109/L, by fibrinogen replacement with \ncryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma to maintain a level >150 mg/dL, \nand by maintenance of PT and PTT close to normal  values . Patients with \nclinical coagulopathy need to be monitored daily until resolution. Given the \nrisks o f coagulopathy in APL at diagnosis, invasive procedures including \nleukapheresis and/or central line placement should be avoided. If possible, \nthe diagnosis of APL may be made using peripheral blood samples, which \nmay minimize risk of bleeding complications until coagulopathy can be \nadequately controlled.  \nATO therapy may prolong the QT interval, making patients susceptible to \nventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, prior to initiation of therapy, an ECG is \nrecommended to assess the QT interval. Routine monitoring (eg, weekly) \nduring therapy is suggested for pat ients  who are older . Serum electrolytes \n(calcium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorous) should also be \nmonitored prior to and during therapy to maintain electrolytes within the \nmiddle or upper normal range. Other drugs that prolong the QT interval \nshould be avoided during ATO therapy to minimize the risk of cardiac \narrhythmias. For p atients with an absolute QT c interval >500 msec , the \nuse of a QTcF (corrected QT interval by Fredericia ) correction formula is \nrecommend and ECGs should be reassessed on a weekly basis during \ninduction therapy, and prior to each course of post -remission therapy.  A \ncardiology consult may be appropriate for patients with prolonged QTc and \nwhen QTcF corrections are unavailable.213  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

There is no evidence for whether growth \nfactors have a positive or negative impact on  long-term outcome if used \nduring consolidation. However, growth factors may be considered during \nconsolidation in selected cases, including in the event of life -threatening \ninfections, or when signs/symptoms of sepsis are present, in an attempt to \nshorten the duration of neutropenia.  \nAntiviral prophylaxis for herpes zoster (HZ) for the duration of treatment \nmay be appropriate, given the association between ATO exposure and \nHZ.215  \nManagement of Acute Myeloid Leukemia  \nThe intent of traditional induction chemotherapy is to produce a major \nreduction in the leukemic burden and to restore normal hematopoiesis. \nInitial treatment decisions for AML are based on a variety of factors, \nincluding functional/performance status and comorbid  medica l conditions  \n(factors that influence one’s ability to tolerate standard induction therapy ), \na history of antecedent hematological conditions, exposure to prior \nchemotherapy or RT, and specific disease biology . Although these \nbiological facto rs, typically reflected by cytogenetic and molecular \nmarkers, are powerful predictors of outcomes, initial therapeutic decisions must sometimes be made before this  information is fully available.  While \nAML can present as a medical emergency that requires rapid initiation of \ntherapy, it is becoming increasingly recogniz ed in the field  that it may be  \npossible to delay treatment to wait for this biological information ; \noptimizing treatment options based on this information may be ideal.216 \nEarly in the process of developing a treatment plan, it is reasonable to \nconsider referral to palliative care for consultation.28 \nWith respect to induction chemotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed \nAML, NCCN now recommends  consideration  for intensive induction  \ntherapy to be  a function of overall fitness  rather than age. Previously, age \n>60 years was considered the therapeutic divergence point  to not pursue \nintensive induction  based on : a higher prevalence of unfavorable genetics \nand antecedent myelodysplasia, a higher incidence of multidrug \nresistance, and an increased frequency of comorbid medical conditions \nthat resulted in higher treatment -related mortality .217,218  Now, a dults who \nare older with intact functional status (ie, ECOG score 0 –2), minimal \ncomorbidit ies, and de novo  AML without unfavorable cytogenetics or \nmolecular markers, and especially those with favorable features, may \nbenefit from intensive cytarabine -based therapy regardless of chronologic \nage. Similarly, younger patients with the presence of high -risk factors  with \nconventional intensive induction  may be considered for non -conventional \ninduction approaches. Overall, because (CR rates rarely exceed 70 % in \nyounger patients and 50% in patients  who are older , substantial \nopportunity exists for innovative clinical trials involving both patient \npopulations.  \nA treatment decision -making algorithm for previously untreated, medically \nfit patients ≥60 years of age with AML was developed by the German AML \nCooperative Group.

The algorithm, with or without knowledge of cytogenetic \nor molecular risk factors, predicts the probability of achieving a CR and the \nrisk for an early death for patien ts who are older with untreated AML and \nconsidered eligible for standard intensive treatments.219 In addition, \ncomprehensive geriatric assessments can be complementary to the \nassessment of comorbid conditions and are emerging as better predictive \ntools of functional status.220-224 \nA comprehensive predictive model for early death following induction in \npatients with newly diagnosed AML suggests that age may reflect other \ncovariates , and the evaluation of these factors may provide a more \naccurate predictive model.218 The model includes performance score, age, \nplatelet count, serum albumin, presence or absence of secondary AML, \nWBC count, peripheral blood blast percentage, and serum creatinine. \nThese factors, when taken together, result in a predictive accuracy based \non the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82 (a perfect correlation is an AUC \nof 1.0).218 This model is complex, and currently there is not a tool available \nto implement this model. A shortened form of the model was based on \ncovariates  that include age, performance status, and platelet count. The \nsimplified model provides an AUC of 0.71, which is less accurate than the \ncomplex model but may be more accurate than decision -making strategies \nbased solely on age.218 \nAnother retrospective study used the fitness criteria originally proposed by \nFerrera et al in 2013225 that included age >75 years, medical comorbidities, active resistant infection, and performance status ≥3 not \nrelated to leukemia , to categorize patients into 3 categories: 1) fit for \nintensive chemotherapy; 2) unfit for intensive chemotherapy; and 3) unfit \nfor even non -intensive therapy.226 These categories of fitness were found \nto be independent predictors of survival, with median survival of 10.9 \nmonths for the fit for intensive chemotherapy group, 4.2 months for the \nunfit for intensive chemotherapy  group, and 1.8 months in the unfit for \neven non -intensive therapy  group ( P = .000). Additionally, in the unfit for \neven non -intensive therapy  group, survival with any form of treatment was \nnot better than with best supportive care. For the unfit for intensive \nchemotherapy  group, non -intensive therapy was found to be as effective \nas intensive therapy and for the fit for intensive chemotherapy group, \nintensive therapy was more effective than non -intensive therapy.  \nIn a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with AML (n = 1100; \nrange, 20 –89 years), a composite predictive model examined the impact \nof comorbidities on 1 -year mortality following induction treatment.227 This \nanalysis incorporated patient -specific (ie, age, comorbidities) and AML -\nspecific (ie, cytogenetic and molecular risks) features, and resulted in a \npredictive estimate of 0.76 based on AUC.227 \nAML Induction Therapy for Patients Eligible for Intensive Induction \nTherapy  \nInduction Therapy  \nStandard induction regimens used for patients eligible for intensive \ninduction therapy are based on a backbone of cytarabine plus an \nanthracycline , and CR rates for patients who are ≤50 years of age have \nconsistently been in the range of 60% to 70% in most large cooperative \ngroup trials using this therapy.

Idarubicin, which has a longer \nintracellular retention time, used at doses of 12 mg/m2 daily for 3 days, has \nhad comparable remission rates with fewer patients requiring additional \ntherapy at day 15 to achieve remission.  \nThe randomized Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA) -9801 study \n(n = 468) showed that idarubicin induction (using the standard 12 mg/m2 \ndaily for 3 days or intensified with 12 mg/m2 daily for 4 days) compared \nwith higher  dose daunorubicin ( ≤80 mg/m2) yielded a significantly higher \nCR rate in patients aged 50 to 70 years (80% vs. 70%, respectively; \nP = .03).228 The median  OS for all patients was 17 months. The estimated \n2-year EFS and OS rates were 23.5% and 38%, respectively, and the \nestimated 4 -year EFS and OS rates were 18% and 26.5%, respectively; \nhowever, no significant differences were observed between treatment \narms  with regard to EFS, OS, and cumulative relapse rates.228 \nThe ALFA -9803 study (n  = 416) evaluated induction with idarubicin (9 \nmg/m2 daily for 4 days) compared with daunorubicin (45 mg/m2 daily for 4 \ndays) in patients ≥65 yea rs of age.229 In this trial, the CR rate after \ninduction was 57% and induction death occurred in 10% of patients. The \nmedian OS for all patients was 12 months; the estimated 2 -year OS rate \nwas 27%. No significant differences in these outcomes were seen \nbetween anthracycli ne treatment arms.229 Long -term outcomes based on a \ncombined analysis of data from the two ALFA trials above (9801 and 9803 \nstudies; n  = 727) showed superior results with standard idarubicin \ninduction (36 mg/m2 total dose) compared with daunorubicin induction \n(240 mg/m2 total dose for patients <65 years of age; 180 mg/m2 total dose \nfor patients ≥65 years of age) in patients ≥50 years of age with AML.230 At \na median actuarial follow -up of 7.5 years, the median OS for all patients \nincluded in the analysis was 14.2 months. The estimated 5 -year OS rate was 15.3%, and the overall cure rate was 13.3%. Induction with standard \nidarubicin was associated with a significantly higher cure rate compared \nwith daunorubicin (16.6% vs. 9.8%; P = .018). In the group of patients <65 \nyears of age, standard idarubicin was still associated with a significantly \nhigher cure rate than daunorubicin despite the high dose (240 mg/m2 total \ndose) of daunorubicin (27.4% vs. 15.9%; P = .049).230 \nIn a systematic review and meta -analysis of 29 randomized controlled \ntrials (RCTs) comparing idarubicin to daunorubicin,231 idarubicin had a \nlower remission failure rate compared to daunorubicin ( relative risk [ RR], \n0.81; 95% CI, 0.66 –0.99; P = .04), but no difference was observed in early \ndeath or overall mortality. Furthermore, this benefit was only seen when \nthe dose ratio between daunorubicin and idarubicin was <5. Both \nhigh-dose daunorubicin and idarubicin resulted in 5 -year survival rates \nbetween 40% and 50%.231 \nIn a HOVON trial, which randomized patients ≥60 years of age to induction \ntherapy with standard -dose cytarabine combined with either \nstandard -dose daunorubicin (45 mg/m2 daily for 3 days; n  = 411) or \ndose -escalated daunorubicin (90 mg/m2 daily for 3 days; n  = 402), the CR \nrate was 54% and 64%, respectively ( P = .002).232 No significant \ndifferences were observed in EFS, DFS, or OS outcomes between \ntreatment arms.

A study from Burnett et al233 compared \nthese two doses in 1206 patients who were predominately <60 years of \nage. There was no difference in CR (73% vs. 75%; OR, 1.07; 95% CI, \n0.83–1.39; P = .60). The 60 -day mortality was higher in the patients \nreceiving 90 mg/m2 (10% vs. 5%; HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.30 –3.02; P = .001), \nthough the 2 -year OS was similar (59% vs. 60%; HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.95 –\n1.43; P = .15).231 It is worth noting that all patients received a second \ncourse of chemotherapy that included additional daunorubicin ( 50 mg/m2) \non days 1, 3, and 5, which may potentially have mitigated the effects of a \n90 mg/m2 daunorubicin dose.   \nAlthough patients >75 years of age with significant comorbidities generally \ndo not benefit from conventional chemotherapy treatment, the rare patient \nwith favorable -risk AML and no significant comorbidities might be an \nexception.  \nFor patients who exceed anthracycline dose or have cardiac issues but \nare still able to receive intensive therapy, alternative non –anthracycline -\ncontaining regimens (eg, FLAG, clofarabine -based regimens) may be \nconsidered.234-239 \nRecent studies have incorporated tailored strategies according to \ncytogenetics and molecular abnormalities, and the current NCCN \nGuidelines for AML outline treatment strategies according to specific  risk \ngroups.  Risk-Stratified Treatment Strategies  \nFavorable -Risk Genetics  \nCytarabine and anthracycline dose during induction:  A large \nrandomized phase III study (E1900) from the ECOG reported a significant \nincrease in CR rate (71% vs. 57%; P < .001) and median OS (24 vs. 16 \nmonths; P = .003) using daunorubicin 90 mg/m2 daily for  3 days (n  = 327) \nversus 45 mg/m2 daily for 3 days (n  = 330) in patients with previously \nuntreated AML <60 years of age.240 Based on subgroup analyses, \nhowever, the survival benefit with high -dose daunorubicin was shown to \nbe restricted to patients with favorable - and intermediate -risk cytogenetic \nprofiles (median OS, 34 vs. 21 months; P = .004) and those <50 years \n(median OS, 34 vs. 19 months; P = .004). The survival outcome for \npatients with unfavorable cytogenetics was poor, with a median OS of only \n10 months in both treatment arms.240  \nCD33 -Positive AML:  GO is a humanized anti -CD33 monoclonal antibody \nconjugated with the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin,241 that was initially \napproved in the year 2000 as a monotherapy for AML based on data from \nsingle -arm phase II trials for adult patients who are older (median age , 61 \nyears) in first relapse.242 The withdrawal of the drug in 2010 was based on \ninterim data from a randomized trial in adult patients (aged 18 –60 years) \nwith AML comparing induction regimens of cytarabine and daunorubicin \nwith or without GO in which there was no improvement in outcomes  and a \nsmall but significant increase in early mortality in the GO arm.199 \nSubsequent results of this trial eventually showed no difference in overall \nmortality between the two arms.200 Since its withdrawal from the market, \nstudies have demonstrated a significant benefit for GO in specific patient \npopulations.

The patients predicted to derive \nsignificant benefit with the GO addition to chemotherapy included those \nwith favorabl e-risk cytogenetics, with a trend towards benefit for those with \nintermediate -risk cytogenetics. Patients with adverse risk cytogenetics \nwere unlikely to derive benefit.243 A meta -analysis of five randomized trials \n(including adult patients ≥60 years of age) showed that adding GO \n(including alternative dosing schedules) to conventional induction therapy \nalso provides survival benefit.244  \nIn the AMLSG 09 -09 trial, 588 patients with newly diagnosed NPM1 -\nmutated AML were randomized to intensive chemotherapy plus ATRA, \nwith and without GO.245 While the study did not reach its primary endpoint \nof significant improvement in EFS ( P = .10), the addition of GO was \nassociated with a significant reduction in cumulative incidence of relapse  \nin patients achieving CR or CR with incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi) \n(P = .005).245 In a follow -up landmark analysis , the addition of GO was \nassociated with significantly lower NPM1  mutation transcript levels by \nreal-time quantitative PCR ( RQ-PCR ) in both BM and peripheral blood \nafter the first cycle of induction, and this effect was sustained throughout \nall subsequent cycles.246 Four-year cumulative incidence of relapse rates \nwere also significantly lower in the GO arm (31.6% vs . 43.9%; P = .015) \nand 4 -year RFS rates were superior (60.5% vs . 48.9%; P = .028).246 In the \nMRC AML 15 trial, younger patients with untreated AML (median age, 49 \nyears) were randomized to two induction courses of: 1) daunorubicin and \ncytarabine with or without etoposide (ADE; n = 1983); or 2) ADE versus \nfludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte  colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF), and idarubicin (FLAG -IDA; n = 1268).247 Patients in the daunorubicin and \ncytarabine  and FLAG -IDA arms were randomly assigned to a single dose \nof GO ( 3 mg/m2) during the first induction course .247 Patients with \nfavorable - and intermediate -risk disease who received two induction \ncourses of FLAG -IDA with GO in course 1, followed by 2 courses of \nHiDAC had an 8 -year survival rate from remission of 72% (favorable risk, \n95%; intermediate risk, 63%).247 \nA phase II trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of FLAG with GO in 45 \npatients ≥18 years of age  (median 48 years; age range 19 –76 years)  with \nnewly diagnosed AML  with CBF-AML [inversion 16, t(16;16), or t(8;21) ].248 \nFor induction and post -remission therapy, patients received FLAG with GO \n3 mg/m2 on day 1, though fludarabine and cytarabine were given for 4  to 5 \ndays with induction and for 3 days with post -remission therapy. Up to 6 \ncycles of post -remission therapy were allowed, though only a total of 2 \ncycles of post -remission therapy could include GO. ORR was 95%, with \n91% of patients achieving CR and 4% of patients achieving CR with \nincomplete platelet recovery (CRp)  with a median number of 5 post -\nremission cycles (r ange, 0 –6 cycles). Three -year OS and RFS were 78% \nand 85%, respectively. The most common grade 3 –4 non-hematologic \nadverse events were elevation of AST/ALT, respiratory failure, renal \ninsufficiency, and cardiac arrhythmias. There were no reports of SOS.   \nThere are conflicting data about the use of GO for patients who are older \nwith AML.

Patients who achieved a  CR/CRi after \ninduction received two consolida tion courses with daunorubicin and \ncytarabine, with or without GO (3 mg/m2 on day 1) . The CR/CRi after \ninduction was similar between the GO and control arms (81% vs. 75%). \nThe GO arm was associated with significantly higher estimated 2 -year \nEFS (41% vs. 17%; P = .0003), RFS (50% vs. 23%; P = .0003), and OS \n(53% vs. 42%; P = .0368) rates compared with the control.251 The GO arm \nwas associated with a higher incidence of hematologic toxicity (16% vs. \n3%; P < .0001); this was not associated with an increase in the risk of \ndeath from toxicity.251  \nIn another multicenter, phase III, randomized trial from the UK and \nDenmark (AML -16 trial), patients >50 years of age with previously \nuntreated AML or high -risk MDS (n  = 1115) were randomized to receive \ndaunorubicin -based induction (daunorubicin combined w ith cytarabine or \nclofarabine) with or without (control) GO (3 mg/m2 on day 1 of course 1 of \ninduction).250 The median age was 67 years (range, 51 –84 years) and \n98% of patients were ≥60 years of age; 31% were ≥70 years  of age . The \nCR/CRi  rate after induction was similar between the GO and control arms \n(70% vs. 68%). The GO arm was associated with significantly lower 3 -year \ncumulative incidence of relapse (68% vs. 76%; P = .007) and higher \n3-year RFS (21% vs. 16%; P = .04) and OS (25% vs. 20%; P = .05) rates \ncompared with the control arm. The early mortality rates were not different \nbetween treatment arms (30 -day mortality rate, 9% vs. 8%); in addition, no \nmajor increase in adverse events was observed with GO.250 These two \ntrials suggest that the addition of GO to standard induction regimens \nreduced the risk of relapse and improved OS outcomes in patients who are older  with previously untreated AML characterized by favorable - or \nintermediate -risk cytogenetics, not adverse -risk. A review of these studies \nled to the approval of GO in September 2017 for the treatment of adults \nwith newly diagnosed CD33 -positive AML.  \nThe third phase III trial combining GO with chemotherapy showed a \ndifferent result than the other two. In this study, patients between the ages \nof 61 and 75 years were given  chemotherapy consisting of mitoxantrone, \ncytarabine, and etoposide (n  = 472).249 Half of the patients were given 6 \nmg/m2 GO prior to chemotherapy on days 1 and 15. In remission, \ntreatment included two courses of consolidation with or without 3 mg/m2 \nGO on day 0. The OS between the two groups was similar (GO, 45% vs. \nno GO, 49%), but the induction and 60 -day mortality rates were higher in \nthe patients given GO (17% vs. 12% and 22% vs. 18%, respectively). Only \na small subgroup of patients < 70 years of age with secondary AML \nshowed any benefit to treatment. Combined with the increased toxicity, the \nresults of this study suggest  that GO may not provide an advantage over \nstandard chemotherapy for some patients who are older with AML.249 \nConflicting studies have led to the publication of several systematic \nreviews and meta -analyses. A larger systematic review, inclusive of any \nRCTs that investigated the benefit of anti -CD33 antibody therapy, \nregardless of whether treatment was in de novo o r secondary disease, \nconcluded that the data from 11 trials showed increased induction deaths \n(P = .02) and reduced residual disease ( P = .0009).252 Despite improved \nRFS (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84 –0.98; P = .01), no OS benefit was measured \n(HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90 –1.02; P = .2).

Data  have demonstrated \nimproved survival for patients with newly diagnosed FLT3 -mutation –\npositive AML when midostaurin is added to standard chemotherapy as \npart of frontline treatment.255-257 This led to its breakthrough designation \nand approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) in 2017. In \nthe CALGB 10603/RATIFY Alliance trial, patients aged 18 to 59 years, \nwith newly diagnosed FLT3 -mutation –positive AML (ITD or TKD) were \nrandomized (n = 717) to receive standard cytarabine therapy (200 mg/m2 \ndaily for 7 days via continuous infusion) and daunorubicin (60 mg/m2 on \ndays 1 –3) with placebo or midostaurin (50 mg, twice daily on days 8 –\n21).257 If residual disease in the BM was observed on day 21, patients \nwere treated with a second blinded course. Patients who achieved CR \nreceived four 28-day cycles of HiDAC  (3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, \nand 5) with placebo or midostaurin (50 mg, twice a day on days 8 –21) \nfollowed by a year of maintenance therapy with placebo or midostaurin (50 \nmg twice a day).257 The median OS was 74.7 months (95% CI, 31.5 –NR) \nin the midostaurin group compared to 25.6 months (95% CI, 18.6 –42.9) in \nthe placebo group ( P = .009).257 Patients who received midostaurin with \nstandard induction and consolidation therapy experienced significant \nimprovement in OS (HR for death, 0.78; P = .009) and EFS (HR for event or death, 0.78; P = .002) compared with those on the placebo arm.257 \nThese data may be extrapolated to suggest benefit in fit adults who are \nolder.   \nA retrospective exploratory study found a consistent benefit from the \naddition of midostaurin to standard chemotherapy in patients treated on \nthe RATIFY trial across different NPM1 /FLT3 -ITD genotypes categorized \naccording to the 2017 ELN risk groups (favorable, intermediate, and \nadverse).258 Five-year OS rates for patients treated in the midostaurin arm \ncompared to the placebo arm were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.60 –0.89) versus  0.53 \n(95% CI, 0.40 –0.72) in the favorable -risk groups, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.40 –0.67) \nversus  0.34 (95% CI, 0.23 –0.49) in the intermediate -risk groups, and 0.43 \n(95% CI, 0.32 –0.56) versus  0.20 (95% CI, 0.12 –0.35) in the adverse -risk \ngroups.  \nIn the phase II AMLSG 16 -10 trial in adult patients with previously \nuntreated AML (n = 440; range, 18 –70 years; 128 patients included \nbetween the ages of 61 –70 years), the efficacy and safety of midostaurin \nadded to intensive chemotherapy, followed by allo geneic HCT and single -\nagent midostaurin maintenance therapy for a year was evaluated.259 All \npatients were confirmed to have FLT3 -ITD–positive disease. The CR/CRi \nrate after induction therapy was 74.9% (age ≤60 years, 759%; age >60 \nyears, 72.4%). Forty -five percent of patients proceeded to transplant in \nCR/CRi, and a subset initiated maintenance therapy (n = 163; 128 after \nallogeneic HCT and 35 after HiDAC  consolidation ). The 2 -year EFS and \nOS rates were 59% and 59% in patients <60 years of age, and 41% and \n47% in patients >60 years of age.259 Multivariate analysis showed a \nsignificant OS benefit for patients treated on AMLSG 16 -10 trial compared \nto patients treated on the CALGB 10603/RATIFY Alliance trial (HR, 0.71; \nP < .001).259 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

MS-42 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nThe randomized phase 3 QuANTUM -First trial compared chemotherapy in \ncombination with the FLT3  inhibitor quizartinib versus  placebo in patients \n(n = 539; age range , 20–75 years; median age , 56 years) with newly \ndiagnosed FLT3 -ITD mutated AML.260 For induction, quizartinib 40 mg \ndaily versus  placebo was administered on days 8  to 21 along with \nstandard 7  + 3 (cytarabine 100 –200 mg/m2 for 7 days via continuous \ninfusion and either daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 or idarubicin 12 mg/m2 on days \n1–3). In the setting of persistent leukemia on BM biopsy at count recovery, \nreinduction with 7  + 3 or 5  + 2 plus quizartinib or placebo were treatment \noptions. For those achieving CR or CRi, consolidation therapy consisted of \ncytarabine 1.5  to 3 mg/m2 combined with quizartinib versus  placebo, \nallogeneic HCT, or both. Following consolidation , maintenance therapy \nconsisted of single -agent quizartinib versus placebo for ≤3 years. With a \nmedian follow -up of 39.2 months, OS was 31.9 months in the quizartinib \ncompared to 15.1 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.78; P = .032). \nThere were similar amounts of adverse events between the two arms, \nthough neutropenia was more common in the quizartinib group.260  \nSome studies suggest that a higher dose of daunorubicin (90  mg/m2), \ncompared to lower doses of either 45 or 60  mg/m2, is significantly \nassociated with increased CR and survival rates in patients with \nintermediate -risk cytogenetics and those who have FLT3 -ITD mutation –\npositive AML.261,262 A phase III study compared idarubicin (12 mg/m2 for 3 \ndays) and high -dose daunorubicin (90 mg/m2 for 3 days) with standard \ncytarabine therapy during induction in young adults with newly diagnosed \nAML (age range, 15 –65 years). It was determined that high -dose \ndaunorubicin was associated with higher OS and EFS rates in patients \nwith FLT3 -ITD mutation –positive AML.263 However, these studies did not \ninclude midostaurin or quizartinib.  Therapy -Related AML or Antecedent MDS/CMML or \nCytogenetic Changes Consistent with MDS  \nAlthough most cases of AML are de novo , secondary AML and therapy -\nrelated AML account for approximately 25% of all AML cases and are \nassociated with poor outcomes .264,265 Data have demonstrated improved \nsurvival in patients with secondary AML  who are older  when a dual -drug \nliposomal formulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin  in a 5:1 molar ratio \n(CPX -351) is used as frontline therapy.266-268 In a phase II trial, patients \n≥60 years of age with newly diagnosed AML (n = 126) were randomized \n2:1 to first -line CPX -351 or the conventional administration of cytarabine \nand daunorubicin (7  + 3 regimen).267 Compared to the standard 7  + 3 \nregimen, CPX -351 produced higher response rates (CPX -351, 66.7% vs. \n7+  3, 51.2%; P = .07) ; however , differences in EFS and OS were not \nstatistically significant.267 A planned analysis of the secondary AML \nsubgroup demonstrated that CPX -351 was associated with a higher CR \nrate (57.6% vs. 31.6%;  P = .06).267  \nThese results led to the development of a randomized phase III study \ncomparing the efficacy and safety of CPX -351 to the conventional \nadministration of cytarabine and daunorubicin ( control arm) in patients 60 –\n75 years of age with newly diagnosed secondary AML (n = 309).268 With a \nmedian follow -up of 20.7 months, CPX -351 significantly improved  OS \ncompared to the control arm (median, 9.56 vs. 5.95 months; HR, 0.69; \n95% CI, 0. 52–0.90; P = .003).268 CPX-351 was also associated with \nsignificantly higher overall remission (47.7% vs. 33.3%; P = .016) and CR \n(37.3% vs. 25.6%; P = .04) rates. However, for patients with  cytogenetic \nchanges consistent with MDS (previously classified as  AML-MRC ) and \nprevious hypomethylating agent ( HMA ) exposure, the benefit from \nstandard induction did not differ from the benefit with CPX -351.

The most recent study from the EORTC -GIMEMA AML -12 trial \nsuggests that HiDAC (3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 2, 5, and 7) \nimproves outcome in patients who are <46 years of age.269 This study \nrandomized 1900 patients between the ages of 15 and 60 years into two \ntreatment groups, HiDAC and standard -dose cytarabine (100 mg/m2/d by \ncontinuous infusion for 10 days). Both groups were also given \ndaunorubicin (50 mg/m2/d on days 1, 3, and 5) and etoposide (50 mg/m2/d \non days 1 –5). Data from a median 6 -year follow -up indicate an OS near \nstatistical significance (HiDAC, 42.5% vs. SDAC, 38.7%; P = .06), and \nwhen separated by age with a cutoff of 46 years, the benefit was relegated \nto the <46 years of age patient cohort (HiDAC, 51.9% vs. SDAC, 43.3%; \nP = .009) compared to patients ≥46 years of age (HiDAC, 32.9% vs. \nSDAC, 33.9%; P = .91). Other populations that benefited from HiDAC \nwere patients with high -risk disease, including patients with very poor -risk \ncytogenetic abnormalities and/or FLT3 -ITD mutation or with secondary \nAML. There was no significant increase in grade 3 or 4 toxicities except for \nan increase in conjunctivitis (grade 2 –3) with HiDAC (12.4%) versus \nSDAC (0.5%). The incidence  of adverse events was equivalent (SDAC, \n67.6% vs. HiDAC, 66.2%). Patients in CR received a single consolidation \ncycle of daunorubicin and cytarabine (500 mg/m2 every 12 hours for 6 \ndays) and subsequent HCT.269 \nHiDAC therapy during induction was initially explored in the 1990s  in two \nlarge cooperative group trials. In an Australian Leukemia Study Group trial,270,271 patients <60 years of age were randomized (n  = 301) to receive \neither HiDAC (3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 for a total of 24 \ng/m2) or standard cytarabine therapy (100 mg/m2 daily for 7 days via \ncontinuous infusion); patients in both arms received daunorubicin (50 \nmg/m2 on days 1 –3) and etoposide (75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days). The CR \nrates were equivalent in both arms (71% and 74%, respectively), and a \nsignificantly higher 5 -year RFS rate was observed in the HiDAC arm (48% \nvs. 25%; P = .007).271 Patients in both treatment arms received only 2 \ncycles of standard -dose cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide for \nconsolidation therapy. Median remission duration was 45 months for the \nhigh-dose arm, compared with 12 months for the standard treatment \narm.270 However, treatment -related morbidity and mortality were higher in \nthe HiDAC arm; the 5 -year OS rates were 33% in the high -dose arm \ncompared with 25% in the standard -dose arm.271   \nIn a large SWOG study,272 patients <65 years of age (n  = 665) with de \nnovo  or secondary AML were randomized to receive HiDAC (2 g/m2 every \n12 hours  for 6 days for a total of 24 g/m2; patients <50 years of age were \ninitially randomized to receive 3 g/m2 at the above schedule before the \nhigh-dose arm was redefined to 2 g/m2 because of toxicity concerns) or \nstandard -dose cytarabine (200 mg/m2 daily for 7 days); patients in both \ntreatment arms also received daunorubicin (45 mg/m2 daily for  3 days). \nPatients treated in the HiDAC arm received a second high -dose cycle for \nconsolidation, whereas patients in the standard -dose arm were \nrandomized to receive consolidation therapy with either 2 cycles of \nstandard -dose cytarabine or 1 cycle of HiDAC  plus daunorubicin.

Induction therapy \nwith HiDAC was associated with significantly higher rates of \ntreatment -related mortality (14% vs. 5% for patients <50 years of age; \n20% vs. 12% for patients aged 50 –64 years; P = .003) and grade 3 or \nhigher neurologic toxicity (8% vs. 2% for patients <50 years of age; 5% vs. \n0.5% for patients aged 50 –64 years; P < .0001).272 For patients <50 years \nof age, consolidation with HiDAC was associated with similar rates of \ntreatment -related mortality (2% vs. 0%) and grade 3 or higher neurologic \ntoxicity (2% vs. 0%) compared with the standard dose. For the original \ncohort of patients  <50 years of age who received 3 g/m2 HiDAC for \ninduction, the rates of treatment -related deaths (10% vs. 5%) and grade 3 \nor greater neurologic toxicity (16% vs. 2%) were higher than for those who \nreceived the standard dose. Similarly, for patients <50 yea rs of age who \nreceived 3 g/m2 HiDAC for consolidation, the rates of treatment -related \ndeaths (4% vs. 0%) and grade 3 or greater neurologic toxicity (16% vs. \n0%) were higher than for those who received the standard dose.272 \nPatients <50 years of age who received HiDAC induction and \nconsolidation in the SWOG trial had the highest OS and DFS rates at 4 \nyears (52% and 34%, respectively) compared with those who received \nstandard -dose induction and consolidation (34% and 24%, resp ectively) or \nstandard induction with high -dose consolidation (23% and 14%, \nrespectively).272 However, the percentage of patients achieving a CR who \ndid not proceed to consolidation was twice as high in the HiDAC induction \narm.272 The risks for neurotoxicity and renal insufficiency are increased \nwith HiDAC; therefore, both renal and neurologic function should be \nclosely monitored in patients receiving this treatment. In a CALGB trial,273 \nthe subgroup of patients ≤60 years of age (n  = 156) who received \nstandard -dose cytarabine -daunorubicin induction therapy and 4 courses of \nHiDAC consolidation (3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5, per course) experienced a 4 -year DFS rate of 44%. Among all patients who \nreceived consolidation with HiDAC, the rates of treatment -related deaths \nand serious neurotoxicity were 5% and 12%, respectively.273  \nBecause the OS outcomes for the high -dose arm in the SWOG trial \nconsisting of HiDAC induction and 2 cycles of HiDAC consolidation (4 -year \nOS rate of 52% for patients <50 years of age) were comparable to those \nof the CALGB trial with standard -dose infusiona l cytarabine induction and \n4 cycles of HiDAC consolidation (4 -year OS rate of 52% for patients aged \n≤60 years), the use of HiDAC in the induction phase outside of a clinical \ntrial remains controversial. A meta -analysis including 22 trials and 5945 \npatients  with de novo AML <60 years of age demonstrated improved RFS \nand reduced risk of relapse, particularly in the favorable -risk cytogenetics \ngroup, for patients receiving HiDAC versus standard chemotherapy.274 \nHowever, toxicity was a limiting factor and emphasis was placed on the \nimportance of future studies to define the populations that would most \nbenefit from HiDAC and to optimize dosing recommendations. The \ndecision to use high - versus standard -dose cytarab ine for induction might \nbe influenced by consolidation strategies; fewer high -dose consolidation \ncycles may be needed for patients induced with HiDAC or for those who \nwill undergo early autologous HCT. Although the remission rates are \nsimilar for high - and standard -dose cytarabine, two studies have shown \nmore rapid marrow blast clearance after 1 cycle of high -dose therapy and \na DFS advantage for patients ≤50 years of age who received the \nhigh-dose therapy.275 No data are available using >60 mg/m2 of \ndaunorubicin or 12 mg/m2 of idarubicin with HiDAC. With either high - or \nstandard -dose cytarabine -based induction for younger patients, between \n20% and 45% of these patients will not enter remission.

In a subset \nanalysis, there was a significant improvement in  OS and EFS for the ELN \nintermediate I group, primarily in patients in the NPM1  wild-type/ FLT3 -\nITD–negative subgroup with a 4 -year EFS of 40% for the clofarabine arm \nversus 18% for the control arm.277   \nThe combination of cladribine, cytarabine, G -CSF, and mitoxantrone  \n(CLAG -M) has been studied as induction therapy for patients with AML in \nthe relapsed/refractory ( R/R) setting by the Polish Adult Leukemia \nGroup.278,279 In a multicenter phase II study, 118 patients with R/R AML \nreceived induction therapy with cladribine  5 mg/m2, cytarabine 2 g/m2, mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2, and G -CSF. For those who achieved PR with \ninduction, a second cycle of CLAG -M was given, while those who \nachieved CR received consolidation with cytarabine and mitoxantrone, \nwith or without cladribine.

For more information \non these options, see AML Induction Therapy for Patients Ineligible for \nIntensive Induction .  \nThere are also emerging data with intensive chemotherapy agents in \ncombination with venetoclax.282 \nNCCN Recommendations  \nThe NCCN AML Panel strongly encourages enrollment in a clinical trial for \ntreatment induction for patients with AML. Patients with AML with TP53  \nmutation or del(17p) are groups with especially poor prognosis and should \nbe considered for enrollment in clinical trials. For patients not enrolled in a \nclinical trial, genetics, overall functional status, and the risk status of the \ndisease guide treatment strategies .  \nFor patients with favorable -risk AML by cytogenetics (CBF -AML), \ninfusional standard 7  + 3 (cytarabine 100–200 mg/m2 continuous infusion \nfor 7 days combined with either idarubicin [ 12 mg/m2 for 3 days] or \ndaunorubicin [60 –90 mg/m2 for 3 days]) combined with GO243,251 is a \npreferred recommendation. Other recommended regimens include \nstandard 7  + 3 without GO233,240 or standard 7  + 3 with mitoxantrone (12 \nmg/m2 for 3 days ).283 FLAG -IDA combined with GO247 is another \nrecommended regimen, though should be used with caution in patients \n>60 years of age. FLAG with GO can be considered for patients ineligible \nfor an anthracycline  (category 2B) .248 Of note, the Panel prefers GO over \nFLT3  inhibitor -based regimens for patients with CBF -AML with FLT3 -TKD.  \nFor patients with favorable -risk AML by molecular mutation profile or \nintermediate -risk AML  according to ELN risk stratification ,22 preferred regimens include standard 7  + 3 with either daunorubicin or idarubicin \n(category 1 recommendation), or for patients ≥60 years of age, \nmitoxantrone can be considered.

In addition, HLA testing should be performed promptly in those \nwho may be candidates for either fully ablative or reduced -intensity \nconditioning (RIC) allogeneic HCT from a matched sibling or an alternative \ndonor, which constitutes the best opt ion for long -term disease control.285  \nFor patients with poor -risk AML not participating in clinical trials, other \nrecommended regimens include standard 7  + 3 (daunorubicin or \nidarubicin ), CPX-351281 (category 2B recommendation), FLAG -IDA \n(category 2B recommendation), CLAG -M (category 2B) , and venetoclax \ncombined with decitabine (days 1 –5) or azacitidine. Regimens that may be \nuseful in certain circumstances include 7  + 3 with mitoxantrone (for \npatients ≥60 years  of age; category 2B recommendation)  or cytarabine \nwith either daunorubicin or idarubicin and etoposide (category 2B \nrecommendation for patients >45 years of age; to be used with caution in \npatients >60 years of age).  \nPostinduction Therapy After Cytarabine -Based Induction    \nTo judge the efficacy of the induction therapy, a BM aspirate and biopsy \nmay be performed 14 to 21 days after start of therapy. In patients who \nhave received cytarabine -based induction and have residual disease \nwithout hypoplasia (hypoplasia is defined as cellularity <20% of which the residual blasts are <5% [ie, blast percentage of residual cellularity]), \nadditional therapy with cytarabine 100  to 200 mg/m2 and anthracycline or \nmitoxantrone (for age ≥60 years),  or escalation to higher doses of \ncytarabine 1  to 3 g/m2 may be considered for re -induction; no data are \navailable to determine superiority of cytarabine 100  to 200 mg/m2 versus 1 \nto 3 g/m2 . After a BM biopsy on day 21, cytarabine 100  to 200 mg/m2 with \nanthracycline and midostaurin257 or quizartinib260 should be considered for \npatients with FLT3 -mutated AML  (quizartinib only for FLT3 -ITD AML) . If \ndual-drug liposomal encapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin was \ngiven during induction, after a BM biopsy 14 –21 days after induction, re -\ninduction with CPX -351 [cytarabine (100 mg/m2) and daunorubicin (44 \nmg/m2)] as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3 is \nrecommended for patients with therapy -related AML other than CBF -AML, \nantecedent MDS/CMML, or cytogenetic changes consistent with MDS .268 \nRegimens for R/R disease  may also be considered.  \nIf the marrow is hypoplastic, additional treatment selection is deferred until \nthe blood counts recover and remission status can be assessed. If there is \nno evidence of hematologic recovery, a ll patients should have a repeat BM \naspirate and biopsy by day 42 -post treatment, regardless of the degree of \nhematologic recovery.   \nIf hypoplasia status is unclear, a repeat BM biopsy should be performed \nwithin 7 days before proceeding with post induction therapy. For patients \nwho achieve CR with the additional post induction therapy, consolidation \ntherapy can be initiated upon count recovery. Screening LP should be \nconsidered a t first remission before first consolidation for patients with \ndisease with monocytic differentiation, MPAL, WBC count >40 x 109/L at \ndiagnosis, extramedullary disease, or FLT3  mutations.

MS-48 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nPatients who have persistent disease following two courses of therapy \n(including a reinduction attempt based on mid -cycle marrow) are \nconsidered to have had a lack of response to primary induction , or primary \nrefractory disease . Treatment options include clinical trial or use of \nchemotherapy regimens used for R/R disease (see Management of \nRelapsed/Refractory AML ). However, the likelihood of achieving a CR with \na third chemotherapy regimen is low, at approximately 20%. If the patient \ndid not receive cytarab ine-based therapy for persistent disease at day 15, \ncytarabine 2  to 3 g/m2 with or without anthracycline may be used if a \nclinical trial is not available and a donor is not yet identified. If regimens \nused will result in high cumulative doses of cardiotoxic agents, consider \nreassessing the patient’s cardiac function before each \nanthracycline/mitoxantrone -containing course.286 \nIf the patient has an identified sibling or alternative donor available, a \ntransplant option should be explored, although the Panel encourages \nusing alternative therapies to achieve remission prior to the transplant. For \npatients whose clinical condition has deteriorated such that active \ntreatment is not an option, best supportive care should be continued.  \nPost -Remission or Consolidation Therapy in Patients Eligible for \nIntensive Induction Therapy  \nAlthough successful induction therapy clears the visible signs of leukemia \nin the marrow and restores normal hematopoiesis in patients with de novo  \nAML, additional post -remission therapy (ie, consolidation) may be needed \nto reduce the residual abnormal cells to a level that can be contained by \nimmune surveillance. For patients eligible for intensive induction therapy , \npost-remission therapy is also based on risk status defined by \ncytogenetics and molecular abnormalities (see Evaluation for AML in the \nalgori thm and Initial Evaluation in the Discussion).  High -Dose Cytarabine : Since 1994, multiple (3 –4) cycles of HiDAC \ntherapy have been the standard consolidation regimen for patients <60 \nyears of age with disease with either favorable - or intermediate -risk \ncytogenetics . This consolidation therapy is based on a CALGB trial \ncomparing 100 mg/m2, 400 mg/m2, and 3 g/m2 doses of cytarabine.273 The \n4-year DFS rate for patients receiving consolidation with 3 g/m2 of HiDAC \nwas 44%, with a 5% treatment -related mortality rate and a 12% incidence \nof severe neurologic toxicity. Although the initial report did not break down \nremission duration by cytogenetic groups, subsequent analysis showed a \n5-year RFS (continuous CR  measured from time of randomization) rate of \n50% for CBF -AML, 32% for patients with NK -AML, and 15% for patients in \nother cytogenetic categories (overall P < .001). Among the patients wh o \nreceived HiDAC consolidation, the 5 -year RFS rate was 78% for CBF -\nAML, 40% for NK -AML, and 21% for other cytogenetic categories.276  \nIn some studies, in patients with CBF -AML who received postremission \ntherapy with HiDAC, the presence of KIT mutations resulted in poorer \noutcomes, particularly in t(8;21).43,49 In a multicenter study, patients with \nCBF-AML (n = 67) were enrolled in intensive chemotherapy protocols that \ninvolved HiDAC postremission therapy.43 At 24 months, a KIT mutation in \nthe TKD at codon 816 (TKD816) in patients with t(8;21) was associated with \na significantly higher incidence of relapse (90% vs. 35.3 %; P = .002) and \nlower OS (25% vs. 76.5 %; P = .006) compared to wild -type KIT.43 In CBF -\nAML with inv(16), TKD816 did not result in a significant difference in relapse \nincidence and OS.43 The prognostic influence of TKD816 and other \nmutations in exon 17 (mut KIT17 ) versus other recurrent KIT mutations in \nCBF-AML, such as exon 8 (mut KIT8 ), have been investigated.49,98 In an \nanalysis of adult patients <60 years of age with CBF -AML treated on \nCALGB trials (n  = 110), KIT mutations (mut KIT17 and mut KIT8 ) among \npatients with  disease with  inv(16) were associated with a higher PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

In patients with \nt(8;21), KIT mutations were associated with a higher incidence of relapse \nat 5 years (70% vs. 36 %; P = .017), but no difference was observed in \n5-year OS (42% vs. 48%).49 The CALGB trial also included 4 courses of \nmonthly maintenance chemotherapy with daunorubicin and subcutaneous \ncytarabine after the consolidation phase; however, only 55% of patients in \nCR received maintenance chemotherapy following HiDAC \nconsolidation.273 Subsequent clinical trials have eliminated this form of \nmaintenance therapy after post -remission therapy. However, the impact of \nKIT mutations in CBF -AML is unclear. A meta -analysis of 11 studies \nexamining the effect of KIT mutations on CR, OS, and relapse rates of \nCBF-AML determined that KIT mutations did not affect CR rates.287 In \npatients with t(8;21) AML, KIT mutations were associated with an \nincreased risk of relapse and shorter OS rates compared to inv(16) \nAML.287  \nSome studies suggest that after induction, relative to KIT mutations, MRD \nmay be a more relevant prognostic factor for CBF -AML risk \nstratification.280,288 -290 In a prospective study, adult patients with CBF -AML \n(aged 18 –60 years; n = 198) were randomized to receive a reinforced \ninduction course (treatment arm A) or standard induction course \n(treatment arm B), followed by 3 HiDAC consolidation courses.289 \nTreatment arm A consisted of a first sequence with daunorubicin (60 \nmg/m2/day by a 30 -minute IV infusion) on days 1 and 3 and cytarabine \n(500 mg/m2 continuous infusion) from days 1 to 3, followed by a second \nsequence at day 8 with daunorubicin (35 mg/m2/day by a 30 -minute IV \ninfusion) on days 8 and 9, and cytarabine (1000 mg/m2 every 12 hours by a 2-hour infusion) on days 8 and 10.289 Treatment arm B consisted of \ncytarabine (200 mg/m2 continuous infusion) for 7 days combined with \ndaunorubicin (60 mg/m2 for 3 days ). In treatment arm B, at day 15 a \nperipheral blood and BM evaluation was performed followed by a second \nsequence of chemotherapy in patients who reached CR.289 In addition, \nMRD levels were serially monitored for RUNX1 ::RUNX1T1  and \nCBFB ::MYH11  by RQ-PCR  in BM samples before the first, second, and \nthird consolidation courses. In this study, both treatment arms \ndemonstrated similar efficacy. After first consolidation, higher WBC, KIT \ngene mutations and/or FLT3  gene mutations, and a <3-log MRD reduction \nwere associated with a higher specific hazard of relapse, but MRD was the \nonly prognostic factor in multivariate analysis.289 At 36 months, the \ncumulative incidence of relapse and RFS were 22% versus 54% ( P < \n.001) and 73% versus 44% ( P < .001) in patients who achieved 3 -log MRD \nreduction versus other patients.289 A prospective study analyzed the effect \nof a condensed HiDAC consolidation therapy schedule given on days 1, 2, \nand 3 versus the commonly used schedule of days 1, 3, and 5 in adult \npatients (aged 18 –60 years) with AML (n = 176), and found that there was \nno cumulative hematologic toxicity and no change in survival.291 \nIntermittent  shortages of several chemotherapy agents have raised the \nquestion of how best to use cytarabine. The HOVON/SAKK study \ncompared a double -induction concept using intermediate -dose cytarabine \nor HiDAC as part of an induction/consolidation regimen in a phase III \nrandomized study in patients (age 18 –60 years) with newly diagnosed \nAML (n  = 860).292 Patients were randomized to treatment with an \n“intermediate -dose” cytarabine regimen (12 g/m2 cytarabine; cycle 1: \ncytarabine, 200 mg/m2 daily for 7 days + idarubicin, 12 mg/m2 daily for 3 \ndays; cycle 2: cytarabine, 1 g/m2 every 12 hours for 6 days + amsacrine, \n120 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) or a “high -dose” cytarabine regimen (26 g/m2 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Patients who \nexperienced a CR after both treatment cycles were eligible to receive \nconsolidation with a third cycle of chemotherapy or autologous or \nallogeneic HCT.292 A similar proportion of patients in each treatment arm \nreceived consolidation, specifically 26% to 27% of third chemotherapy \ncycle patients, 10% to 11% of autologous HCT patients, and 27% to 29% \nof allogeneic HCT patients. No significant differences were observed \nbetween the intermediate - and high -dose arms in rates of CR (80% vs. \n82%), 5 -year EFS (34% vs. 35%), or 5 -year OS (40% vs. 42%).292 These \nresults are comparable to those from the CALGB study with HiDAC.273 \nMore than 50% of patients in each arm had already experienced a CR \nwhen they received cycle 2. The 5 -year cumulative rate of relapse risk was \nalso similar between treatment arms (39% vs. 27%, respectively).292 \nOutcomes were poor  for patients with disease with monosomal karyotype \nat baseline (n  = 83), although the high -dose regimen was associated with \nsignificantly improved rates of 5 -year EFS (13% vs. 0%; P = .02) and OS \n(16% vs. 0%; P = .02) compared with patients in this subgroup receiving \nthe intermediate -dose. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicities after cycle 1 \nwas higher in the high -dose arm than in the intermediate -dose arm (61% \nvs. 51%; P = .005), but the incidence of 30 -day mortality was the same in \nboth arms (10%).292 This study suggests that 2 cycles of \nintermediate -dose cytarabine (1 g/m2 every 12 hours for 6 days; total dose \n12 g/m2 per cycle) for each consolidation cycle may be a feasible \nalternative to 3 cycles of HiDAC (3 g/m2 for 6 doses; total dose of 18 g/m2 \nper cycle). This study as well as the MRC AML 15 study247 suggest that \ndoses of 3 g/m2 of cytarabine are not clearly more effective than lower \ndoses of 1.5 –3 g/m2; in the MRC AML 15 trial, the cumulative incidence of relapse was statistically lower for higher dose cytarabine but this did not \ntranslate into better RFS.247  \nIntermediate -Dose Cytarabine : The prospective CALGB trial273 \nestablished the efficacy of HiDAC consolidation in patients with AML ≤60 \nyears of age.273 In this study, a subgroup of patients with AML ≥60 years \nof age who received standard -dose cytarabine -daunorubicin induction \ntherapy and more than one course of HiDAC consolidation (3 g/m2 every \n12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5, per course) experienced severe \nneurotoxicity and a 4 -year DFS rate of <16%.273 Although the CALGB trial \ndid not show an overall benefit for higher doses of cytarabine \nconsolidation in patients ≥60 years of age ,273 a subset of patients with a \ngood performance status, normal renal function, and a normal or low -risk \nkaryotype might be considered for a single cycle of cytarabine (1.0 –1.5 \ng/m2 daily for  4–6 doses) without an anthracycline. In a study by Sperr et \nal, the CALGB consolidation was modified and given as intermediate -dose \ncytarabine at 1 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5, per course , for 4 \ncycles in a group of AML patients >60 years of age.293 In this study, the \ntreatment was well -tolerated without neurotoxicity and 25 of 47 patients \nreceived all 4 consolidation cycles.

The 4 -year OS rate among patients with \nintermediate -risk disease  was 53% for the donor group and 54% for the \nno-donor group.294 \nThe SWOG/ECOG trial reported a 5 -year survival rate (from time of CR) of \n44% with allogeneic HCT (n  = 18; 61% underwent HCT) and 13% with \nautologous HCT (n  = 20; 50% underwent HCT) among the subgroup of \npatients with unfavorable cytogenetics. Moreover, the  5-year survival rate \nwas similar between those allocated to autologous HCT and those \nintended for chemotherapy consolidation alone (13% and 15%, \nrespectively).36 The 5 -year survival rates (from time of CR) for patients \nwith disease with intermediate -risk cytogenetics were 52% for the \nallogeneic HCT group (n  = 47; 66% underwent HCT) and 36% for the \nautologous HCT group (n  = 37; 59% underwent HCT).36  \nIn the UK MRC AML 10 trial, significant benefit with allogeneic HCT was \nobserved for the subgroup of patients with disease with intermediate -risk \ncytogenetics (but not for those with  disease with  favorable or high -risk \ncytogenetics). In this subgroup, the DFS (50% vs. 39%; P = .004) and OS \nrates (55% vs. 44%; P = .02) were significantly higher among the donor \ngroups than the no -donor groups.295  \nThe role of myeloablative allogeneic HCT is limited in patients who are \nolder because of significant comorbidities; however, ongoing interest has \nbeen shown in RIC allogeneic HCT as consolidation therapy.296,297  Case \nseries and analysis of registry data have reported encouraging results, \nwith 40% to 60% 2 -year OS rates and 20% non -relapse mortality for patients who underwent transplant in remission.296,297 In a retrospective \nanalysis comparing outcomes with RIC allogeneic HCT and autologous \nHCT in patients ≥50 years of age based on large registry data, RIC \nallogeneic HCT was associated with lower risk for relapse and superior \nDFS and OS relative to autologous HCT.296 The authors also noted that a \nsurvival benefit was not observed in the subgroup of patients undergoing \nRIC allogeneic HCT in first CR because of an increased incidence of non -\nrelapse mortality.  \nEstey et al298 prospectively evaluated a protocol in which patients ≥50 \nyears of age with disease with unfavorable cytogenetics would be \nevaluated for a RIC allogeneic HCT.298 Of the 259 initial patients, 99 \nexperienced a CR and were therefore eligible for HCT evaluation. Of these \npatients, only 14 ultimately underwent transplantation because of illness, \nlack of donor, declining, or unspecified reasons. The authors compared \nthe results of RIC allogeneic HCT with those from matched participants  \nreceiving conventional -dose chemotherapy. This analysis suggested that \nRIC allogeneic HCT was associated with improved RFS, and the authors \nconcluded that this approach remains of interest .298 In an analysis of \noutcomes between two different strategies for matched -sibling allogeneic \nHCT, outcomes in patients ≤50 years of age (n  = 35) receiving \nconventional myeloablative allogeneic HCT were compared with those in \npatients >50 years of age (n  = 39) receiving RIC allogeneic HCT.299 This \nstudy showed similar rates of 4 -year non -relapse mortality (19% and 20%, \nrespectively), and no difference was seen in relapse and OS rates.299  \nA retrospective study based on data in patients 50 –70 years of age with \nAML compared outcomes in patients who underwent allogeneic HCT \n(either myeloablative conditioning or RIC; n  = 152) with those who did not \nreceive HCT in first CR (chemotherapy only; n  = 884).300 Allogeneic HCT PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Survival outcomes between these groups were \nsimilar, with 3 -year OS rates of 63% and 61%, respectively.300  \nAnother study evaluating treatment in patients 60 –70 years of age \ncompared outcomes between RIC allogeneic HCT reported to the Center \nfor International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (n  = 94) and \nstandard chemotherapy induction and postremission ther apy from the \nCALGB studies (n  = 96).301 Allogeneic HCT in first CR was associated with \nsignificantly lower 3 -year relapse (32% vs. 81%; P < .001) and higher \n3-year leukemia -free survival rates (32% vs. 15%; P < .001) compared \nwith the chemotherapy -only group. As would be expected, allogeneic HCT \nwas associated with a significantly higher rate of non -relapse mortality \n(36% vs. 4%; P < .001) at 3 years; the 3 -year OS rate was not significantly \ndifferent between the groups (37% vs. 25%; P = .08), although there was \na trend favoring allogeneic HCT.301 A prospective multicenter phase II \nstudy examined the efficacy of RIC allogeneic HCT in patients 60  to 74 \nyears of age with AML in first CR (n = 114).302 After allogeneic HCT, DFS \nand OS at 2 years were 42% (95% CI, 33% –52%) and 48% (95% CI, \n39%–58%), respectively, for the entire group.302 A time -dependent \nanalysis of four successive prospective HOVON -SAKK AML trials \nexamined data from patients ≥60 years of age who obtained a first CR \nafter induction chemotherapy (n = 640).303 For patients who received allogeneic HCT as post -remission therapy (n = 97), a 5 -year OS rate was \n35% (95% CI, 25% –44%).303 \nCollectively, these studies suggest that RIC allogeneic HCT is a feasible \ntreatment option for patients ≥60 years of age, particularly those in first CR \nwith minimal comorbidities and who have an available donor. For this \nstrategy to be better used, potential transplant options should be \nconsidered during induction therapy, and alternative donor \noptions/searc hes should be explored earlier in the disease management.  \nNCCN Recommendations  \nConsolidation therapy options for patients with favorable -risk AML by \ncytogenetics (CBF -AML)  or by molecular mutation profile per ELN22 \ninclude cytarabine; cytarabine (5 or 7 days) combined with daunorubicin  or \nidarubicin , or mitoxantrone for those ≥60 years of age; and cytarabine with \nGO or cytarabine with daunorubicin or idarubicin and GO for those with \nCD33 -positive disease. GO regimens should only be given during \nconsolidation if also utilized during induction. Consolidation should be \nfollowed by maintenance therapy for those eligible or by consideration of \nallogeneic HCT for patients who are unable to complete consolidation or  \nwho have high -risk disease features such as MRD positivity or KIT \nmutation. Of note, p atients who receive transplant shortly following GO \nadministration may be a t risk for developing SOS .304 If transplant is \nplanned, it should be noted that prior studies have used a 60 - to 90 -day \ninterval between the last administration of GO and HCT.  \nOptions for consolidation therapy for patients with FLT3 -mutated disease \ninclude  allogeneic HCT (preferred for FLT3 -ITD),  cytarabine combined \nwith midostaurin ( FLT3 -ITD or TKD) or quizartinib ( FLT3 -ITD only).

MS-53 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nFor those with intermediate -risk AML, consolidation options include \ncytarabine or cytarabine with daunorubicin and GO for those with CD33 -\npositive disease. Allogeneic HCT is also an option for those who have \nalready achieved remission and have a donor available.  \nFor those with poor -risk AML with and  without TP53  mutation or del(17p) \nabnormality, therapy -related AML (other than CBF -AML), antecedent \nMDS/CMML , and cytogenetic changes consistent with MDS , consolidative \nallogeneic HCT is preferred for those in remission with an available donor. \nOther consolidation options include CPX -351/dual -drug liposomal \nencapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin or FLAG -IDA (preferred for \nthose who received those agents during induction therapy). For patients \nwho received lower intensity regimens for induction, such as HMAs with \nvenetoclax, these reg imens can be continued as consolidation therapy.  \nFor patients with FLT3 -mutated disease, intermediate -risk, poor -risk, or \nsecondary AML, maintenance therapy or allogeneic HCT (if not previously \nperformed) for those who are eligible are options following consolidation \ntherapy.  \nAML Induction Therapy for Patients Ineligible for Intensive \nInduction  \nIn patients who cannot tolerate intensive treatment strategies, low -intensity \napproaches have been investigated, including use of HMAs alone or \ncombined with venetoclax . \nHypomethylating Agents (HMAs)  \nAn international, randomized, phase III study by Fenaux et al305 compared \nthe HMA 5 -azacitidine with conventional care (best supportive care, \nlow-dose cytarabine, or intensive chemotherapy) in patients with MDS \n(n = 358). Although this study was designed for evaluation of treatment in patients with high -risk MDS (based on FAB criteria), 113 study patients \n(32%) fulfilled criteria for AML using the 2008 WHO classification, with \nmarrow -blast percentages between 20% and 30%.305,306 In the subgroup \nof these patients with AML, a significant survival benefit was found with \n5-azacitidine compared with conventional care regimens, with a median \nOS of 24.5 months versus 16 months (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28 –0.79; \nP = .005).306 The 2 -year OS rates were 50% and 16%, respectively \n(P = .001). In a phase III study focused on adult patients ≥65 years of age, \nthe efficacy and safety of azacitidine versus conventional care regimens \n(standard induction chemotherapy, low -dose cytarabine, or supportive \ncare) was evaluated in patients with newly  diagnosed AML with >30% \nblasts.307 Compared to conventional care regimens, azacitidine was \nassociated with an increase in median OS (6.5 vs.10.4 months; HR, 0.85; \n95% CI, 0.69 –1.03; stratified log -rank P = .1009).307 The 1 -year survival \nrates with azacitidine and conventional care regimens were 46.5% and \n34.2%, respectively.  \nAnother HMA, decitabine, has also been evaluated as remission induction \ntherapy for patients who are older with AML.308 In a phase II study in \npreviously untreated patients ≥60 years of age (n  = 55; median age, 74 \nyears), the overall CR rate with this agent (20 mg/m2 for 5 days every 28 \ndays) was 24% (including 6 out of 25 patients [24%] with poor -risk \ncytogenetics), and the median EFS and OS were 6 months and 8 months, \nrespectively.308 An earlier phase I study evaluated different dose \nschedules of decitabine in patients with R/R leukemias (n  = 50; AML \ndiagnosis, n  = 37).309 In this study decitabine was given at 5, 10, 15, or 20 \nmg/m2 for 5 days per week for 2 to 4 consecutive weeks (ie, 10, 15, or 20 \ndays). The decitabine dose of 15 mg/m2 for 10 days (n  = 17) was \nassociated with the highest response rates, with an overall response rate \n(ORR) of 65% and CR rate of 35%.

Another meta -analysis comparing venetoclax \nwith HMA or LDAC revealed significant improvements in OS with \nvenetoclax with azacitidine compared to single -agent azacitidine (HR , \n0.66), LDAC azacitidine (HR 0.57), and best supportive care azacitidine \n(HR, 0.37).320 Similarly, venetoclax with LDAC led to significant \nimprovements in OS compared with LDAC (HR , 0.70) and best supportive \ncare (HR, 0.46).  \nVenetoclax has also been studied in triplet combinations, including with \nLDAC and cladribine. In a phase II study, the efficacy of \nvenetoclax/cladribine/LDAC alternating with venetoclax/azacitidine was \nevaluated in 60 patients with newly diagnosed AML deem ed ineligible for \nintensive therapy  (n = 60; median age 68 years; range 57 –84 years) .321 \nPatients received cladribine 5 mg/m2 IV on days 1  to 5, LDAC 20 mg SC \ntwice daily days 1  to 10, and venetoclax 400 mg once daily days  1 to 21 \nfollowing ramp up. Cytoreduction with either hydroxyurea, cytarabine, or \nATRA was utilized prior to the start of therapy for patients with WBC >20 x \n109/L.

Low -dose cytarabine resulted in a CR rate of 18% (vs. 1% with \nhydroxyurea) and a survival benefit compared with hydroxyurea in patients \nwith favorable or NK -AML. No advantage was observed with the a ddition \nof ATRA. The median DFS in patients who achieved a CR with low -dose \ncytarabine was 8 months.322 Even with this “low -intensity” treatment \napproach, induction death occurred in 26% of patients, and overall \nprognosis remained poor for patients who were older who could not \ntolerate intensive chemotherapy regimens.

In the GO \ngroup, the median OS was 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.2 –6.8 months) and 3.6 \nmonths (95% CI, 2.6 –4.2 months) in the best supportive care group.325 IDH Mutation -Positive AML  \nInitially approved by the FDA for use in the R/R AML setting, IDH-targeted \ninhibitors, enasidenib and ivosidenib, have demonstrated utility in the \nfrontline setting.86,89,326 In a phase I/II study, the clinical activity and safety \nof enasidenib, an IDH2 mutant inhibitor, was evaluated in adult patients \nwith IDH2 -mutated  advanced AML including R/R disease.327 \nApproximately 19% of patients (n = 34 of 176) with R/R AML achieved CR, \nwith an OS of 19.7 months with a median OS of 9.3 months.327 In patients \n≥60 years with newly diagnosed AML, the efficacy of enasidenib was \nevaluated in a phase Ib/II sub -study within the Beat AML trial.86 Patients \nwere treated with enasidenib (100 mg/day) in continuous 28 -day cycles. \nAzacitidine (75 mg/m2 days 1 –7) was added to enasidenib for some \npatients who did not achieve CR/CRi by cycle 5. Of 23 patients with \nevaluable data receiving enasidenib monotherapy, CR/CRi was achieved \nin 43% of patients (7 CR/2 CRi).86  \nIn an ongoing phase  I/II study, the safety and efficacy of enasidenib plus \nazacitidine was compared to azacitidine alone in 101 patients (median \nage, 75 years) with newly diagnosed, IDH2 -mutated AML.87 In the phase II \nportion of the study, ORR  was improved with enasidenib plus azacitidine \ncompared to azacitidine alone (74% [50/68] vs . 36% [12/33], respectively; \nP = .0003).  \nIvosidenib, an IDH1 -mutation inhibitor, demonstrated durable remissions \nin IDH1  R/R AML, with 30.2% of patients (n = 54 of 179) with R/R AML \nachieving CR/ CR with partial hematologic recovery ( CRh).328 As an \nextension of this study, the safety and efficacy of ivosidenib in patients \nwith untreated AML was evaluated (n = 34; median age, 76.5 years).88,326 \nIn a phase I dose -escalation and expansion  study , patients received \nivosidenib once daily or twice daily in 28 -day cycles, and a dose of 500 mg PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Similarly, median OS was improved in the \nazacitidine/ivosidenib arm (24 vs . 7.9 months; P = .001). Rates of \ndifferentiation syndrome, grade ≥3 neutropenia, and bleeding were higher \nin the azacitidine/ivosidenib  arm, while rates of grade ≥3 febrile \nneutropenia and infection were higher in the azacitidine/placebo arm.  \nTreatment with both enasidenib and ivosidenib may induce differentiation \nsyndrome and hyperleukocytosis, which may be managed with \ncorticosteroids and hydroxyurea.329-331   \nAlternatively,  as previously discussed  emerging data suggest that patients \nwith de novo  AML characterized by IDH1/2 -mutant AML may benefit from \nvenetoclax/HMA -based therapy with reported remission rates of >70%, \nalbeit in a relatively small number of patients.85,315 \nFLT3 -Positive AML  \nThe phase III randomized LACEWING trial compared  the safety and \nefficacy of azacitidine plus gilteritinib, a FLT3  inhibitor that has \ndemonstrated antileukemic activity in FLT3 -positive R/R AML ,332,333 to azacitidine alone in patients (n = 123; median age 78 years) with newly \ndiagnosed FLT3 -mutated AML who were  ineligible for intensive induction \nchemotherapy.334 Though OS was similar with gilteritinib/azacitidine \ncompared to azacitidine alone (9.82 vs. 8.87 months; P = .753), composite \nCR (CRc) rates were significantly higher with gilteritinib/azacitidine (58.1% \nvs. 26.5%; P < .001). Rates of adverse events were also similar between \nthe two arms.  \nThere is emerging evidence that venetoclax combined with azacitidine and \ngilteritinib may be beneficial in patients with FLT3 -mutated AML who are \nineligible for intensive  chemotherapy ,335 though with careful dosing to \nreduce the incidence of significant cytopenias .  \nNCCN Recommendations  \nSimilar to recommendations for patients eligible for intensive induction \ntherapy, t he NCCN AML Panel encourages enrollment in a clinical trial for \ntreatment induction of patients with AML who are ineligible for intensive \ninduction therapy.

If a response is observed, allogeneic HCT \nmay be considered for select patients if a donor is available. Alternatively, \nlow-dose therapies used in induction with demonstrated efficacy may be \ncontinued until progression (see AML Induction Therapy for Patients \nIneligible for Intensive Induction; NCCN Recommendations ). Thereafter, \nmaintenance therapy can be considered for those who are eligible.  If no response or progression is seen, a clinical trial, therapies for R/R \nAML (see Management of Relapsed/Refractory AML ), or best supportive \ncare are recommended options.  \nMaintenance Therapy  \nHypomethylating Agents (HMAs):  To improve treatment outcomes, \nsome studies have evaluated the efficacy of maintenance therapy with \nHMAs after induction or allogeneic HCT. CC -486 is a novel oral \nformulation of azacitidine that allows prolonged exposure in patients with \nhematologic malig nancies.336,337 In a phase I/II trial evaluating the efficacy \nof oral azacitidine as maintenance therapy after allogeneic HCT in adult \npatients (≥18 years) with AML or MDS, patients received 1 of 4 dosing \nschedules per 28 -day cycle for ≤12 cycles.338 Of 30 patients, 7 received \noral azacitidine once daily for 7 days per cycle (n = 3 at 200 mg; n = 4 at \n300 mg), and 23 received oral azacitidine for 14 days per cycle (n = 4 at \n150 mg; n = 19 at 200 mg [expansion cohort]).338 At 19 months of follow -\nup, median OS was NR and estimated 1 -year survival rates were 86% and \n81% in the 7 -day and 14 -day dosing cohorts, respectively.338 \nIn the international phase 3 trial, QUAZAR AML -001, investigators \nevaluated the efficacy of oral azacitidine as post -remission therapy in adult \npatients (≥55 years of age) who had newly diagnosed AML or secondary \nAML, and had experienced CR or CRi after in duction with intensive \ntherapies but were ineligible for allogeneic HCT (n = 472; median age, 68 \nyears; range, 55 –86 years).339 Within 4 months of attaining CR or CRi, \npatients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 234) or 300 mg of oral \nazacitidine (n = 238) once daily on days 1  to 14 of repeated 28 -day \ntreatment cycles.

In addition, the median RFS \nwas significantly prolonged in the oral azacitidine arm at 10.2 months \ncompared to the placebo arm at 4.8 months (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52 –0.81; \nP = .0001). Based on these data, in September 2020, the FDA approved \noral azacitidin e for continued treatment of patients with AML who achieved \nfirst CR or CRi following intensive induction chemotherapy and are not \nable to complete intensive postremission therapy. In a post hoc analysis, \npatients with NPM1 -mutated AML had improvement in OS by 37%  (HR, \n0.63; 95% CI, 0. 41–0.98) and RFS by 45% (HR, 0. 55; 95% CI, 0. 35–0.84) \nwith oral azacitidine compared to placebo.340 Oral azacitidine also led to a \n37% OS (HR, 0.6 3; 95% CI, 0. 35–1.12) and 49% RFS benefit (HR, 0. 51; \n95% CI, 0. 27–0.95) in patients with FLT3 -mutated AML compared to \nplacebo. For both patients with NPM1 -mutated AML and FLT3 -mutated \nAML, median OS benefit was seen regardless of MRD status post \nintensive chemotherapy .  \nIn a phase 3 randomized trial, HOVON97, investigators evaluated the \nefficacy of maintenance therapy with azacitidine in patients with AML or \nMDS with refractory anemia with excess of blasts (n = 116; aged ≥60 \nyears) who were in CR or CRi after intensive ch emotherapy.341 Patients \nwere randomized to either observation (n = 60) or treated with azacitidine \n(n = 56) at 50 mg/m2 subcutaneously on days 1  to 5 every 4 weeks until \nrelapse for a maximum of 12 cycles.341 Thirty -five patients received at \nleast 12 cycles of azacitidine and the estimated 12 -month DFS for the \nazacitidine and observation groups was 64% and 42%, respectively (log \nrank, P = .04).341 A randomized trial compared conventional care ( low-dose cytarabine  or \nintensive chemotherapy) to decitabine 20 mg/m2 days 1  to 5 every 4  to 8 \nweeks in patients (n = 50 [45 with evaluable data]; median age , 57 years ; \nrange , 24–79) with AML in first or subsequent CR.342 With a median \nfollow -up of 44.9 months, fewer  patients experienced relapse in the \ndecitabine arm, though  this was  not statistically significant (50% vs. 60%; \nP = .7). There was also no significant difference in OS (45% vs . 36%; P = \n.9) or EFS (35% vs . 32%; P = .9).  Another randomized phase II trial \ncompared the safety and efficacy of  an abbreviated 3 -day schedule of \ndecitabine 20 mg/m2 IV every 4 weeks  for 1 year to observation in patients \n≥60 years of age (n = 120; median age 69 years) with AML treated wi th \nintensive induction therapy in the ECOG -ACRIN E2906 phase III trial.343 \nAbbreviated decitabine was associated with improvement in DFS ( P = \n.012) and OS ( P = .06) in the entire cohort. A significant improvement in \nOS was noted in patients with FLT3 -ITD-negative AML ( P = .039).  \nA multicenter, phase II, randomized trial compared maintenance therapy \nwith low -dose decitabine to no intervention in patients with high -risk AML \nwho achieved MRD negativity post -allogeneic HCT  (n = 202 with \nevaluable data) .344 High risk was defined as AML with poor -risk \ncytogenetics per ELN, primary refractory or relapsed AML, or secondary \nAML. Patients in the low -dose decitabine arm received decitabine 5 \nmg/m2 IV days 2  to 6 combined with r ecombinant human G-CSF (rhG-\nCSF)  SC on days 1  to 6 every 6  to 8 weeks for up to 6 cycles. Two -year \ncumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower in the low -dose \ndecitabine arm (15% vs. 38.3%; P < .01). Two -year cumulative incidence \nof chronic GVHD was similar between the two groups (23% in the low -\ndose decitabine arm vs. 21.7% in the control arm; P = .82).

There are certain circumstances where oral \nazacitidine may be of benefit for those who have completed a \nrecommended course of consolidation.340  \nFor patients with FLT3 -mutated AML who have previously received a n \nFLT3  inhibitor and  for whom no allogeneic HCT is planned, quizartinib \n(FLT3 -ITD only ; preferred for FLT3 -ITD) and midostaurin ( FLT3 -ITD or \nTKD) are maintenance therapy options.   \nPost -allogeneic HCT  \nFor patients with FLT3 -ITD– or TKD -mutated AML in CR following \nallogeneic HCT, gilteritinib, midostaurin, and quizartinib are maintenance \ntherapy options. For patients with FLT3 -ITD–mutated AML in pre -transplant CR1 without MRD negativity by ultrasensitive assay, gilteritinib \nis preferred. Sorafenib is a nother  post-allogeneic HCT maintenance \ntherapy option for patients with FLT3 -ITD–mutated AML  only.  \nFor patients with a history of AML with poor -risk features  in remission \npost-allogeneic HCT, low -dose decitabine + G -CSF is a recommended  \ncategory 2B option  for maintenance therapy.344  \nThroughout maintenance therapy patients  should be reassessed for \nappropriateness of their current regimens, treatment intensity, and \npotential candidacy for allogeneic HCT.  \nPrinciples of Venetoclax Use with HMAs or Low-Dose Cytarabine -\nBased Treatment  \nWith growing use of venetoclax -based therapies (eg, venetoclax with \nHMAs or low -dose cytarabine), and the fact that these therapies may be \ngiven for an indefinite duration as long as patients ’ disease  respond s or \npatients derive hematologic  benefit from the therapies, the AML Panel \nreviewed the literature and emerging guidelines that can inform a \nconsensus on ways to optimize use of these therapies.

There are ongoing studies \ninto the addition of a third agent to the combinations described in this \nsection, and participation in clinical trials is encouraged.  Prior to \nadministering therapy, it is important to achieve a WBC count of <25  x \n109/L with hydroxyurea or leukapheresis if needed.350 It is worth noting that \nthe data supporting a beneficial role for leukapheresis in this context are \nlimited.351 In addition, venetoclax is a substrate of CYP3A4, so dose \nadjustments of venetoclax are recommended  when concurrently using \nvenetoclax with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors , most commonly the azole class \nof antifungal agents .352,353 The AML Panel recommends consulting with a \npharmacist for potential drug interactions and referring to venetoclax \nprescribing information. Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers (eg, \ncarbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin) should be  avoided.  \nTo minimize the development of TLS —which is uncommon in this \nsetting350—during the first cycle of treatment, inpatient  treatment is \nstrongly recommended , especially through dose  escalation.  The \nintrapatient dose escalation for venetoclax with HMA is 100 mg, 200 mg, \nand 400 mg given daily on days 1 to 3; and the intrapatient dose \nescalation for venetoclax with low-dose cytarabine  is 100 mg, 200 mg, \n400 mg, and 600 mg given daily on days 1 to 4.350 Concomitant \ninteracting medications may require changes to these dosages. To \nminimize and avert further risk of TLS, the Panel recommends \naggressive monitoring of blood chemistries; monitoring and managing electrolyte imbalances; and treatment with allopurinol or other uric acid -\nlowering agent  until there is no further risk of TLS.350  \nVenetoclax and HMAs have been shown to induce prolonged cytopenias \neven after achieving remission , and neutropenia is a dominant treatment -\nrelated toxicity associated with this combination of agents.354 During the \nfirst cycle, t he Panel recommends continuing treatment regardless of \ncytopenias until a response assessment is made ,352 with aggressive  \ntransfusion  support and supportive care as needed. The Panel also \nrecommends withholding growth factors until after the first cycle \nresponse assessment .350 However, G-CSF should be considered for \nneutropenic patients who are in morphologic remission but whose counts \nhave not recovered  at the end of a treatment cycle . A BM biopsy is \nnecessary  for response assessment on days 21  to 28 of the first cycle ,350 \nperhaps on the earlier end of this range for patients who receive the \ncombination of venetoclax and decitabine .  \nIf there is no morphologic remission ( blasts are ≥5% ) at first cycle \nresponse assessment but evidence of efficacy exists, a second cycle \nshould proceed without interruption with the goal of achieving \nmorphologic remission. A repeat BM biopsy should then be performed on \ndays 21  to 28 of this cycle, or subsequent cycles, until morphologic \nremission is achieved.  \nIf blasts are <5% at first cycle response assessment  and counts have \nrecovered (CR), a second cycle can proceed. If blasts are <5% at first \ncycle response assessment and cytopenias are present ( morphologic \nleukemia -free state [ MLFS ] or CRi), all treatment should be held and the \nfollowing measures should be considered: growth factor support, if \nindicated; and a treatment -free interval for up to 14 days.

When counts have recovered to a clinically \nsignificant threshold ( ANC >0.5 x 109/L and platelets >50 x 109/L), the \nnext cycle of treatment can begin.350 If counts have not recovered to a \nclinically significant threshold, consider repeating the BM biopsy. If \nmorphologic remission is ongoing, therapy can continue to be held or a \nsecond cycle can proceed with adjustments to dose or schedule of \nvenetoclax and  HMA or low -dose cytarabine.350 \nDuring the second and subsequent cycles of treatment, if remission was \nobserved after the first cycle, sequential cycles should continue with up \nto 14 -day interruptions between cycles for count recover y and/or growth \nfactor support.350 If there is no evidence of disease after the first cycle \nand assuming no unexpected changes in blood counts occur, \nconsideration can be made to repeat the BM biopsy at 3 - to 6-month \nintervals, or as needed based on clinical suspicion for relapse, \ndepending on the goals of the patient . If count recovery worsens over \ntime, relapsed disease should be ruled out with a repeat BM biopsy.350 If \nmorphologic remission is ongoing with worsening blood counts, consider \ndecreasing the duration, and/or dose, of venetoclax and/or HMA or low-\ndose cytarabine. However, if there is no morphologic remission after the \nsecond or third cycle, the likelihood of response is decreased, and \nconsideration should be made for enrollment in a clinical trial if available. \nIf no clinical trial is available , and there has been some disease response \nwith manageable toxicity, therapy may be continued as long as it is \ntolerated.  \nIf venetoclax and HMA or low -dose cytarabine are being given to \npatients with R/R AML, the Panel recommends antifungal prophylaxis.354 \nOther recommendations for TLS, intrapatient dose escalation, BM biopsies, and cytopenia mitigation plans are similar to considerations that \nhave been described . \nRole of MRD Monitoring  \nThere is compelling evidence in both children and adults with AML that \ndetectable MRD following achievement of remission is associated with an \nincreased risk of relapse.355 MRD in AML refers to the presence of \nleukemic cells below the threshold of detection by conventional \nmorphologic methods. Patients who have achieved a CR by morphologic \nassessment alone can still harbor a large number of leukemic cells in the \nBM.356 After completion of therapy, “molecular relapses” can predict \nhematologic relapses within a 3 - to 6-month timeframe.355 Due to the \nrapidly evolving nature of this field and the undeniable need for monitoring, \nMRD is still under investigation, with NCCN recommendations as \ndiscussed below.  \nWhile morphologic assessment is the first step in a cure for AML, there \nremains a level of MRD that currently lacks any standardized method of \nmonitoring. The threshold to define MRD+ and MRD - samples depends on \nthe technique and subgroup of AML.  The most frequently employed \nmethods for MRD assessment include quantitative molecular assays such \nas RQ-PCR and multicolor flow cytometry  assays . RQ-PCR amplifies \nleukemia -associated genetic abnormalities, while flow cytometric profiling \ndetects leukemia -associate d immunophenotypes (LAIPs).357-359 Both \nmethods have a higher sensitivity than conventional morphology. RQ -PCR \nhas a sensitivity  of 10-3 to 10-5, while flow cytometry has a sensitivity \nbetween 10-4 to 10-5. The challenge of incorporating these techniques into \nroutine practice is a  lack of standardization and established cutoff values, \nthough ongoing research is focused on addressing these limitations.

MS-65 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \npopulation360,361; however, these techniques are now expanding to include \nother AML subtypes.362 Emerging technologies include digital PCR and \nNGS.356 NGS -based assays can be used to detect mutated genes through \ntargeted sequencing gene panels,363,364 though their routine use is not \nrecommended for MRD assessment given higher sensitivities of PCR - and \nflow cytometry -based methods .356 A highly sensitive NGS -based, targeted, \ndeep -sequencing assay with a sensitivity level of ≤10-5 is recommended \nfor detection of FLT3 -ITD, however.  \nThe data from these methods have been correlated with AML treatment \noutcome and the preliminary results are promising. A systematic review \nand meta -analysis including 11 ,151 patients with AML reported significant \ndifferences in estimated 5 -year RFS and OS among patients who \nachieved negative MRD compared to patients with residual MRD (64% vs. \n25% and 68% vs. 34%, respectively ).355 Refinement of these methods that \ntake into account variables including the intrinsic nature of the transcript as \nwell as factors of the patient population, including age, disease severity, \nand treatment, will make MRD monitoring in patients with AML a mor e \nreliable tool.  \nMethods of Testing  \nMolecular  \nRQ-PCR  \nThere are three classifications of RQ -PCR targets: leukemic fusion genes, \nmutations, and gene overexpression. The most investigated leukemic \nfusion genes are RUNX1 ::RUNX1T1 , CBFB ::MYH11 , and MLL (KMT2A ) \nfusion transcripts. Gene fusions are found in 20% and 35% of adult and \nchildhood non -APL AML cases, respectively.265,365 Mutations in AML \ninclude NPM1 , DNMT3A , and FLT3 -ITD mutations. NPM1  mutations are seen in approximately one -third of adult AML cases, while <10% of \nchildhood cases have this mutation.366,367 Similarly, the DMNT3A  mutation \nis found at a higher percentage in adult (15% –20%) compared to \nchildhood (2%) AML.90,368,369 The FLT3 -ITD mutation is found in 25% of \nadult and 15% of childhood AML.61,370 Two less well -studied mutations that \nmay serve as MRD markers include CEBPA  and MLL-PTDs .371 Finally, the \nmain target of gene overexpression in AML is the Wilms’ tumor ( WT1 ) \ngene. Taken together, these putative targets for MRD monitoring \nencompass the majority of AML cases.  \nA study of 29 patients with either RUNX1 ::RUNX1T1  or CBFB ::MYH11  \nAML during postinduction and post -consolidation chemotherapy did not \nobserve a correlation with survival.372 However, the authors did correlate a \n≥1 log rise in RQ -PCR transcript relative to the remission BM sample as \nindicative of inferior leukemia -free survival and imminent morphologic \nrelapse.372 Another study evaluated BM from 53 patients during \nconsolidation therapy and was the first to establish clinically relevant MRD \ncut-off values for the CBFB ::MYH11  transcript to stratify patients at \nincreased risk of relapse.288 PCR negativity in at least one BM sample \nduring consolidation therapy was predictive of a 2 -year RFS of 79% as \ncompared to the 54% seen in the setting of PCR -positiv ity. Similarly, Yin et \nal290 found that a <3-log reduction in RUNX1 ::RUNX1T1  transcript in BM \nor a >10 CBFB ::MYH11  copy number in peripheral blood after 1 course of \ninduction chemotherapy was highly predictive of relapse.290 A study in 15 \npatients with childhood AML showed that increased RUNX1 ::RUNX1T1  \ntranscript levels were predictive of relapse.373 MLL fusion transcripts for \nMRD monitoring have also been analyzed in 19 patients with \nt(9;11)(q22;q23) AML. Eleven of these patients showed negative PCR for \nthe MLL fusion transcripts, which were associated with a better outcome. \nWhile most studies have shown a correlation between transcript level and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

It also may be an indication \nof variability between adult and pediatric populations, a factor that must be \nconsidered when establishing methods and cutoffs.  \nThe use of RQ -PCR  in mutations is hampered by the inability to \ndistinguish the number of cells containing transcripts, as each cell may \nhave variable levels. Furthermore, these transcripts still may be detected \nin cells that have differentiated in response to treatment and  are no longer \nclonogenic, thereby giving a false positive.375,376 Another caveat is the \ninstability of mutations that may result in false negatives. This is \nparticularly true for FLT3 -ITD377-379 and NPM1  mutations.380-382 Despite \nthese complications, several studies have correlated NPM1  mutations and \noutcome.128,381,383 -388 In a small study of 25 patients, the use of a higher \nsensitivity RQ -PCR was shown to circumvent transcript instability, \nultimately showing that FLT3 -ITD MRD monitoring was predictive of \nrelapse.389  \nIn comparison to FLT3 -ITD, data suggest that NPM1  mutations may be \nmore stable.383 Schittger et al387 developed and tested primers for 17 \ndifferent mutations of NPM1 .387 Serial analyses of 252 NPM1 -mutated \nAML samples at 4 time points showed a strong correlation between the \nlevel of NPM1mut and outcome. Kronke et al382 further modified this method \nto show that NPM1mut levels after double induction and consolidation \ntherapy reflected OS and cumulative incidence of relapse.382 In 245 \npatients, PCR negativity had a 6.5% 4 -year cumulative incidence of \nrelapse versus 53% for patients with a positive PCR.382 This correlation \nwas also seen when taken after completion of therapy. In addition, an RQ -PCR analysis of 2596 samples from 346 patients with NPM1 -mutated AML \ndemonstrated that MRD was the only independent prognostic factor for \nmortality (HR, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.57 –9.15; P < .001) and persisting NPM1 -\nmutated transcripts were associated with relapse.384  \nCEBPA  and MLL-PTDs are additional targets for MRD monitoring by \nRQ-PCR.371,390 While data suggest both transcripts may be suitable MRD \nmarkers, the small sample sizes limit current use of these markers until \ndata can be extrapolated to a larger population. Mutations associated with \nclonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CH IP) and aging \nincluding DNMT3A , TET2 , and potentially ASXL1  are not considered \nreliable MRD markers.363,364,391 \nGene overexpression studies have focused on WT1. Retrospective data \nshow that a lower level of WT1 after induction therapy is associated with \nlong-term remission.392 A meta -analysis of 11 trials, encompassing 1297 \npatients, showed the poor prognostic significance of WT1 level.393 WT1 \nwas overexpressed in 86% of marrow and 91% of blood samples from 504 \npatients with AML when compared to 204 healthy donors.394 However, \nwhen using the cutoff values of >100-fold detection, only 46% of blood and \n13% of marrow samples in the cohort were positive.394 This reflects the \noutliers of the healthy population that have higher WT1 transcripts. \nFurthermore, only 19% of childhood AML samples met this criterion in a \nstudy.395 While WT1 is a strong candidate for MRD monitoring, early \nstudies show that there is variability in the detection of this transcript that \nmust first be addressed. In a retrospective study of AML patients who \nunderwent allogeneic HCT (n = 74), a multigene MRD RQ -PCR array \npredicted clinical relapses occurring in the first 100 days after allogeneic \nHCT compared with 57% sensitivity using WT1 RQ -PCR alone.396 Notably, \nfor patients in CR prior to allogeneic HCT, the presence of pre -PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Loken et al399 showed that 7 of 27 \npatients who had not achieved morphologic remission had negative MRD \nby flow cytometry. All 7 patients were long -term survivors when compared \nwith the remaining 20 patients. Conversely, in a separate study of 188 \npatients in morphologi c remission, <5% had high levels of MRD by flow \ncytometry.399 A larger study of 1382 follow -up BM samples from 202 \nchildren with AML demonstrated MRD to be a predictor of relapse. In this \nstudy 28 of the 38 samples (74%) with >15% myeloblasts had \nmeasurements of ≥0.1% by flow cytometry. In patients with 5% to 15% \nmyeloblasts, 43 of the 129 patients (33%) were detected by the same \nthreshold and only 100 of the 1215 samples (8%) with <5% myeloblasts \nfell into this category. The ability of MRD monitoring to predict an unfavorable EFS was statistically significant ( P < .0001).374 In a study of \nadult patients with AML who underwent allogeneic HCT from peripheral \nblood or BM donor (n = 359), pre -transplant staging with flow cytometry \ndemonstrated similar outcomes in 3 -year OS and PFS estimates between \npatients with MRD -positive morphologic remission and patients with active \ndisease (26% vs. 23% and 12% vs. 13%, respectively) when compared to \npatients in MRD -negative remission (73% and 67%, respectively).400  \nThe most difficult issue facing flow cytometry as an effective method for \nMRD monitoring is standardization and training. Flow cytometry relies \nheavily on the expertise of the technician who must take into account \nvariability in instruments, fluorochromes,  analysis software, and individual \nantigens. Variations in the treatment schedule, dosing, type of treatment, \nand time of draw are also potential variables. Despite the issues with flow \ncytometry, research is focused on improving the method by defining \nthreshold cutoff values401-404 as well as generating standards to equalize \ndata among different instruments and software programs. A study by \nFeller et al405 further defined LAIPs and evaluated whether data from an \nestablished MRD monitoring laboratory could be replicated in four centers \nwith no significant prior experience. Increased success rates of defining \nLAIPs were seen in all four centers after extensiv e group discussion. The \ninexperienced laboratories had a success rate of 82% to 93% for defining \nat least one LAIP in a sample from 35 evaluable samples. The missed \nLAIPs would have resulted in 7% to 18% of the patients being unevaluable \nby MRD in these ce nters. The number of samples incorrectly evaluated \nincreases if they included samples in which at least two LAIPs were \nidentified by the primary lab, but the other labs only detected one LAIP. \nThis accounted for an additional 9% to 20% of cases that would have \nresulted in false negatives. LAIPs with high specificity and sensitivity \n(MRD levels of .01%) were very well -defined in the multicenter analysis.

MS-68 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nWith regard to the missed LAIPs, the authors proposed the design of \nredundant panels to account for immunophenotypic shift. Inconsistencies \nin LAIPs with MRD of ≤0.1% may be resolved with the use of a greater \nnumber of fluorochromes.406 Another important conclusion from this \npublication was the ability of these methods to be applied to different \ninstruments; both the Beckman Coulter and the Becton Dickinson \ninstruments were tested and obtained similar results. MRD monitoring is a \nmore fe asible option if performed in core facilities until greater research is \ndone on the method to eliminate variability. Enrollment in clinical trials that \nprovide MRD monitoring is encouraged.  \nBecause a high -quality sample is essential for reliable treatment \nevaluation, the NCCN AML Panel recommends that the optimal sample for \nMRD assessment is a first dedicated pull of the BM. Once MRD -negative \nremission by BM is achieved, peripheral blood can be utilized for \nsurveillance of MRD for PML::RAR  alpha, NPM1 ,384 CBFB::MYH11 , and \nRUNX1::RUNX1T1 .289  \nTiming of MRD Assessment  \nThe timing of MRD assessments will vary and depend on the regimen \nused,289,384 but may occur after achievement of morphologic \nremission363,364,391 and at the time of and following allogeneic \ntransplantation.407 For NPM1 -mutated AML, MRD assessment is \nrecommended after 2 cycles of intensive chemotherapy (eg, 1 cycle of \ninduction and 1 cycle of consolidation) and for serial monitoring.384 For \nPML::RAR  alpha, MRD monitoring is recommended every 3 months for at \nleast 24 months. Patients receiving venetoclax -based low -intensity therapy \nmay achieve MRD -negative remission at later time points, including a \nsignificant  minority after 4  to 6 cycles of therapy. Therefore, repeat testing \nmay be obtained.  Management of MRD Positivity  \nFollowing an MRD -positive result, i t is recommended that repeat testing \nshould be performed within a short interval (eg, 1 month) if there is no \nhematologic relapse , and a BM biopsy and aspirate should be performed. \nConfirmation of MRD positivity in this setting is an indicator of high risk of \nrelapse and  consideration should be made for allogeneic HCT, clinical \ntrial, consolidation strategies, targeted therapy where appropriate, or \ntherapy for  R/R disease as clinically indicated.  \nFor NPM1 , CBFB::MYH11 , and RUNX1::RUNX1T1 -mutated AML, if MRD \nis persistently positive after induction and/or consolidation, consider ation \nshould be made for a clinical trial or alternative therapies, including \nallogeneic HCT.  \nPostremission Surveillance for AML  \nMonitoring CBCs, including platelets, every  1 to 3 months for the first 2 \nyears after patients have completed consolidation therapy, then every 3 to \n6 months thereafter up to 5 years, is recommended. Bone marrow \nevaluation should be performed only if the peripheral smear becomes \nabnormal or if cyto penias develop, rather than as routine surveillance at \nfixed intervals, unless the bone marrow evaluation is being performed as \npart of a clinical research protocol.  \nA donor search should be initiated at first relapse in appropriate patients \nconcomitant with initiation of therapy. At each relapse or progression, the \nPanel suggests conducting molecular profiling using appropriate material \nto determine the mutation status of actionable genes including FLT3  (ITD \nand TKD), IDH1 , and IDH2  because it may guide selection of appropriate \ntherapies (see Management of  Relapsed/Refractory AML ) and enrollment \nin appropriate clinical trials.

At time of relapse or progression, molecular profiling should be \nconsidered if not done at diagnosis, or repeated to determine clonal \nevolution.  \nTargeted Therapy  \nFLT3 -Positive AML : In a phase I/II study, the safety and tolerability of \ngilteritinib, a n FLT3  inhibitor, was assessed in adult patients with R/R \nAML (n = 252).413 In this group, 58 patients had wil d-type FLT3  and 194 \npatients had FLT3  mutations ( FLT3 -ITD, n = 162; FLT3 -TKD/ FLT3  D385, \nn = 16), and received oral gilteritinib (20 –450 mg) once daily  in one of \nseven dose -escalation or dose -expansion cohorts.413 Gilteritinib was \nwell-tolerated in this patient subpopulation and the most common grade \n3 or 4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia (39%), anemia (24%), \nthrombocytopenia (13%), sepsis (11%) , and pneumonia (11%).413 The \nORR in all patients with R/R AML was 40%, which was improved to 52% in FLT3  mutation -positive AML patients treated with gilteritinib doses ≥80 \nmg/day.413  \nIn a phase 3 trial, the efficacy of gilteritinib was compared to  \nconventional chemotherapy used to treat R/R AML (n = 371).332 In this \nstudy, the four chemotherapy options included two high -intensity options \n(FLAG -IDA; and mitoxantrone plus etoposide and cytarabine [MEC]) and \ntwo low -intensity options (low -dose cytarabine and azacit idine). Of the \n371 patients  with eligible data , 247 were randomly assigned to the \ngilteritinib group (120 mg/day) or the chemotherapy group (n = 124). The \npercentage of patients who had CR with full or partial hematologic \nrecovery was 34% and 15.3% in the gilteritinib and chemotherapy \ngroups, respecti vely.332 The median OS was significantly longer in the \ngilteritinib group compared to the chemotherapy group (9.3 vs . 5.6 \nmonths; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 –0.83; P < .001).332 In addition, the \nmedian EFS was longer in the gilteritinib group when compared to the \nchemotherapy group at 2.8 months versus 0.7 months, respectively (HR \nfor relapse or lack of remission  or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 –1.09).332 \nBased on these data, gilteritinib was approved by the FDA in November \n2018 for the treatment of adult patients who have R/R AML with a n FLT3  \nmutation.  Longer term follow -up data revealed a 2 -year cumulative \nincidence of relapse of 75.5% for the gilteritinib arm, though few relapses \noccurred after 18 months.333 Twenty six of 247 patients in the gilteritinib \narm remained alive for ≥2 years without relapse and 18 of these patients \nwere able to proceed to allogeneic HCT.  \nEmerging evidence suggests that gilteritinib in combination with \nvenetoclax may be beneficial for FLT3 -mutated AML.414  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

MS-70 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nIn a phase II study, the efficacy of azacitidine and sorafenib, a n FLT3  \ninhibitor, was evaluated in adult patients with R/R AML (n = 43; median \nage, 67 years; range, 24 –87 months).415 The response rate was 46%, with \nCR, CR/CRi, and PR rates of 16%, 27%, and 3%, respectively.415 In \naddition, the degree of FLT3 -ITD inhibition appeared to correlate with \nplasma sorafenib concentrations.  \nIn a phase III study, patients aged ≥18 years  with relapsed or refractory \nFLT3 -ITD–mutated AML (n = 335) were randomized to receive the FLT3  \ninhibitor quizartinib v ersus chemotherapy (low -dose cytarabine, MEC, or \nFLAG -IDA).416 With a median follow -up of 23.5 months, OS was 6.2 \nmonths in the quizartinib arm compared to 4.7 months in the \nchemotherapy arm ( P = .02). There were similar rates of sepsis and \nseptic shock between the two arms. Grade 3 QT prolongation occurred \nin 4% of patients in the quizartinib arm by investigator report.  \nIDH Mutation -Positive AML : The studies evaluating the efficacy of \nivosidenib328 and enasidenib327 in IDH1 - and IDH2 -mutation positive R/R \nAML, respectively, have been summarized in a previous section , AML \nInduction Therapy for Patients Ineligible for Intensive Induction , for \npatients who are not candidates  for or decline intensive remission \ninduction therapy.  \nThe IDH1  inhibitor olutasidenib was investigated among patients with R/R \nIHD1 -mutated AML (n = 147; median age, 71 years; age range , 32–87 \nyears) in a phase II trial.417 Thirty -five percent of patients achieved CR  + \nCRh, in a median time of 1.9 months (range , 0.9–5.6 months).  \nCD33 -Positive AML : In a study by Taksin et al, adult patients with AML \nin first relapse (n = 57) received fractionated doses of GO, given at a \ndose of 3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, and 7 for one course .418 Fifteen patients achieved CR (26%) and 4 achieved CRp (7%). The median RFS was \nsimilar for patients who achieved CR and CRp and was 11 months .418 In \naddition, no veno -occlusive disease (sinusoidal obstructive syndromes) \noccurred after GO treatment or after GO followed by HCT (n = 7), \nalthough the authors recommended a minimum delay of 90 days \nbetween GO treatment and HCT .418  \nKMT2A -Rearranged AML:   In the ongoing phase II AUGMENT -101 study \nthe safety and efficacy of the oral menin inhibitor revumenib was \nevaluated in adult and pediatric patients ≥30 days old (n = 94; 57 with \nefficacy -evaluable data) with primary refractory or relapsed KMT2Ar  acute \nleukemia, including 78 patients with AML. Many patients (43.6%) had \nreceived ≥3 prior lines of therapy and 50% of patients had undergone prior \nallogeneic HCT.  \nPatients received revumenib 163 mg (or 95 mg/m2 for those weighing <40 \nkg) every 12 hours in 28 -day continuous cycles. Dose of revumenib could \nbe increased to 276 mg (or 160 mg/m2 if weight <40 kg) if no concomitant \nstrong CYP3A4 inhibitor was being utilized; however , this did not occur on \nstudy and is rare in R/R acute leukemia, as most patients require fungal \nprophylaxis with azoles. Among patients with evaluable data, the CR/CRh \nrate was 22.8%. ORR was 63.2% with 68.2% of patients achieving MRD \nnegativity. Among tho se who achieved response, 38.9% were able to \nproceed to allogeneic HCT and half of these patients receive revumenib \nmaintenance therapy following HCT.   \nThe most common adverse effects were nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, febrile \nneutropenia (grade ≥3 in 37.2% of patients ), and edema. Grade ≥3 \ndifferentiation syndrome occurred in 16% of patients and grade ≥3 QTc \nprolongation occurred in 13.8% of patients.

MS-71 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nBased on this data, the FDA approved revumenib for R/R acute leukemia \nwith a KMT2A translocation in adult and pediatric patients ≥1 year.  \nChemotherapy  \nThe guidelines provide a list of several commonly used regimens for R/R \ndisease that are grouped as either intensive or less intensive therapy (see \nAML: Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory Disease  in the algorithm). The \nregimens grouped under intensive therapy represent purine analog (eg, \nfludarabine, cladribine, clofarabine) –containing regimens, which have \nshown remission rates of approximately 30% to 45% in several clinical \ntrials, and those that have been used as the comparator arms in U.S. \ncooperativ e group  trials in the past decade.  \nA study by Robak et al evaluated the efficacy of cladribine, cytarabine, and \nG-CSF (CLAG) as reinduction therapy in patients with R/R AML (n = \n20).419 Ten patients (50%) achieved CR with a median duration of 22.5 \nweeks (range, 3.5 –53 weeks). Two patients experienced a PR (10%) and \n8 patients had disease that did not respond to therapy.419 In another study, \nthe efficacy of cladribine, cytarabine, and idarubicin was analyzed in \npatients with R/R AML (n = 34).420 After at least one cycle of treatment, 18 \npatients (52.9%) achieved CR and 16 (47.1) received subsequent \nallogeneic HCT.420 In a phase II study, CLAG -M was investigated in \npatients with refractory AML.278 After 1 or 2 cycles of treatment, 49% (n = \n21) of patients achieved CR. One -year OS among patients who achieved \nCR was 73%.  In a phase II study, the safety and efficacy of cladribine, \nidarubicin, and cytarabine (CLIA) combined with venetoclax as induction \nand consolidation was evaluated in  50 patients ≤65 years with newly \ndiagnosed AML  (n = 45), MPAL (n = 1), or MDS (n = 4)  deemed eligible \nfor intensive therapy.421 Cytarabine was dosed at 1.5 g/m2 for patients <60 \nyears of age and at 1 g/m2 for those ≥60 years of age. Venetoclax was given on days 2  to 8 of a 28 -day cycle at 400 mg daily without ramp up, \nthough cytoreduction with hydroxyurea, cytarabine, or ATRA was given \nprior to the start of treatment for patients with a WBC >20 x 109/L. ORR \nrate was 94%. Among patients with available MRD assessments, 82% \nachieved MRD negativity. Estimated 12 -month OS and EFS rates were \n85% and 68%, respectively. Neutropenic fever, infection, and elevations of \nALT were the most frequent grade ≥3 adverse events.  \nIn a study of patients with resistant or relapsing AML (n = 38), patients \nwere treated with fludarabine, cytarabine, and G -CSF (FLAG) , and overall \n21 patients (55%) achieved CR.422 In a study by Parker et al, patients with \nhigh-risk MDS/AML (n = 19; including R/R AML, n = 7), treated with \nfludarabine, cytarabine, G -CSF, and idarubicin responded to therapy, with \n12 patients (63%) achieving CR.423 In a more recent phase Ib/II study \ninvestigating  the safety and efficacy of venetoclax combined with FLAG -\nIDA, 69% of patients with R/R AML achieved MRD -negative CR and 46% \nwent on to receive allogeneic HCT.424 Among those with R/R disease who \nunderwent allogeneic HCT, 1 -year post -HCT survival was 78%.   \nIn a phase I study, a regimen with clofarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin \nwas evaluated in a subgroup of adult patients with R/R AML (n = 21) and \n10 patients (48%) achieved CR.425 A regimen with clofarabine (40 mg/m2) \ncombined with cytarabine (2 g/m2) was evaluated in a randomized, \nplacebo -controlled, phase III trial (CLASSIC I trial) in R/R AML, resulting in \nan ORR of 47% (CR rate, 35%) and a median OS of 6.6 months.426 A \nretrospective study compared clofarabine versus fludarabine in \ncombination with HiDAC with or without G -CSF.427 Patients treated with a \nclofarabine -based regimen (n  = 50) compared to a fludarabine -based \nregimen (n  = 101) had a higher CR rate (OR, 9.57; P < .0001) and a \nlonger survival (mortality HR, 0.43; P = .0002).427   PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

MS-72 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nThe regimens for R/R AML grouped under less intensive therapy include \nHMAs (azacitidine or decitabine), low -dose cytarabine, and venetoclax -\ncontaining regimens. Emerging studies suggest that venetoclax in \ncombination with HMAs or low -dose cytarabine has de monstrated \nantileukemic activity in R/R AML, MDS, and BPDCN.428 A study suggests \nthat azacitidine followed by donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) may be a \ntreatment option for therapy in patients who have AML that relapses after \nallogeneic HCT.429 These data are based on a prospective phase II trial of \n28 patients with AML. In this study, 22 patients received DLIs and an ORR \nof 30% was achieved. This included 7 CRs and 2 PRs. At publication, \nthere were 5 patients still in CR with a median of 777 da ys (range, 461 –\n888 days). Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia grade III/IV were the most \ncommon adverse events (65% and 63%, respectively). Acute and chronic \ngraft-versus -host disease (GVHD) were seen in 37% and 17% of patients, \nrespectively. Correlations sug gest a better response in patients with \nmyelodysplasia -related changes ( P = .011) and lower blast count \n(P = .039) or patients with high -risk cytogenetics ( P = .035). However, \ninterpretation of results is limited by the small size of the study.429 \nAllogeneic HCT  \nIn a randomized trial that investigated whether patients with AML in first \nuntreated relapse or with poorly responsive disease required remission \ninduction prior to allogeneic HCT (n = 281), patients were randomized to \neither disease control measures ( LDAC or a single dose of mitoxantrone) \nfollowed by immediate allogeneic HCT or one cycle of high-dose  \ncytarabine and mitoxantrone in an effort to induce remission prior to \nallogeneic HCT.430 The primary endpoint was achievement of CR on day \n56 post -allogeneic HCT, defined as “treatment success .” In the intent -to-\ntreat population, 83% of patients in the immediate allogeneic group \nachieved “treatment success ,” compared to 79% in the remission induction group (test for non -inferiority, P = .036). A 3.4% difference in treatment \nsuccess was estimated, which did not meet the predefined 2.5% \nsignificance level. Patients in the immediate allogeneic HCT group did \nspend a median of 27 fewer days in the hospital setting , however ( P \n<.0001).   \nNCCN Recommendations  \nThe NCCN AML Panel recommends enrollment in a clinical trial for the \nmanagement of R/R AML as a strongly preferred option. Other options \ninclude targeted therapy or chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HCT. For \ntargeted therapies, the guidelines provide a l ist of options including \ngilteritinib for patients with FLT3  mutations (a category 1 \nrecommendation). Quizartinib (a category 2B recommendation) or \nsorafenib combined with an HMA (azacitidine or decitabine) are targeted \ntherapy options for patients with FLT3-ITD mutations. Other targeted \ntherapy options include GO for patients with CD33 -positive AML, \nivosidenib or olutasidenib for patients with IDH1  mutations, enasidenib for \npatients with IDH2 mutations , or revumenib for patients with KMT2Ar  AML. \nThe regimens for intensive therapy include: 1) CLAG , with or without \nmitoxantrone or idarubicin419,420; 2) cytarabine, if not previously received in \ntreatment, with or without anthracycline286; 3) FLAG with or without \nidarubicin  or venetoclax422-424; 4) etoposide and cytarabine, with or without \nmitoxantrone431,432; 5) clofarabine with or without cytarabine with or without \nidarubicin425,426; 433,434 or 6) CLIA with venetoclax.421 Less intensive \ntreatment options may include: 1) HMAs alone (azacitidine or \ndecitabine)306,313,435; 2) low -dose cytarabine322,436 (a category 2B \nrecommendation); or 3) venetoclax combined with HMAs or low -dose \ncytarabine.428,437 Best supportive care is always an option for patients who \ncannot tolerate or do not wish to pursue further intensive treatment.

MS-73 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nWhile more randomized trials are needed, a llogeneic HCT may be \nconsidered for patients with R/R disease who did not achieve CR following \nfirst induction therapy or for those who had previously been scheduled for \nallogeneic HCT.430  \nSupportive Care for Patients with AML   \nAlthough variations exist between institutional standards and practices, \nseveral supportive care issues are important to consider in the treatment  \nof patients with AML. In general, supportive care measures may include \nthe use of blood products for transfusion support and correction of \ncoagulopathies, tumor lysis prophylaxis, anti -infective prophylaxis, and \ngrowth factor support. Monitoring for neurologic and cardiovascular \ntoxicities may be required for particular therapeutic agents ( cytarabine  or \nATO) or b ecause of patient -specific comorbidities. These supportive care \nmeasures are tailored to address the specific needs and infection \nsusceptibility of each individual patient.  \nWhen transfusion support is required, leukocyte -depleted blood products \nshould be used for transfusion. All patients with AML are at risk for acute \nGVHD and management should be based on institutional practice or \npreference  (see NCCN Guidelines for Hematopoietic Cell \nTransplantation ). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) screening for potential HCT \ncandidates is left to institutional policies regarding provision of \nCMV -negative blood products to patients who are CMV -negative at the \ntime of diagnosis.  HLA typing is routinely used in many institutions to \nselect platelet donors for patients who exhibit alloimmunization to \nHLA-specific antigens.   \nStandard tumor lysis prophylaxis includes hydration with diuresis, and \nallopurinol administration or rasburicase treatment. Rasburicase is a genetically engineered recombinant form of urate oxidase enzyme. \nRasburicase should be considered as initial treatment in patients with \nrapidly increasing blast counts, high uric acid, or evidence of impaired \nrenal function.438 When possible, patients should be evaluated for \nglucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as rasburicase \nuse in these patients is contraindicated and is associated with an \nincreased risk of inducing hemolysis.439,440 Urine alkalinization was \npreviously recommended as a means to increase uric acid solubility and \nreduce the potential for uric acid precipitation in the tubules. However, this \nmethod is not generally favored as there are no data to support this \npractice and  similar effects could be seen with saline hydration alone.441 \nAlkalinization can complicate care by increasing calcium phosphate \ndeposits in vital organs (eg, kidney, heart) as a result of \nhyperphosphatemia. Furthermore, in contrast to allopurinol, rasburicase \nhas the added benefit of rapid breakdown of serum uric a cid, eliminating \nthe need for urine alkalinization.  \nUnless a site -specific contraindication exists, a central venous access \ndevice (CVAD) with multiple lumens is recommended to allow the \nadministration of peripherally contraindicated systemic therapies and \npossibly multiple infusions during higher risk peri ods of cytopenias related \nto disease and/or myelosuppressive therapy. Routine care and \nmaintenance of a CVAD should be provided as per institutional policy. \nRemoval and/or replacement of a CVAD should be determined based on \nindividual clinical circumstance s.  \nPatients who receive doses of cytarabine ≥2 g/m2, or patients >60 years of \nage who receive doses of  cytarabine  1 to 1.5 g/m2, should  be closely \nmonitored for changes in renal function, because renal dysfunction is \nhighly correlated with increased risk of cerebellar toxicity.

Some regimens such as FLAG incorporate \nG-CSF into the reg imen. However, the use of growth factors may \ncomplicate the interpretation of marrow results. There is a recommendation to discontinue colony -stimulating factors at least a week \nbefore a planned marrow sample to assess remission status.                                                                                                         \nThere is no evidence for whether growth factors have a positive or \nnegative impact on long -term outcome if used during consolidation. \nGrowth factors may be considered as part of supportive care for \npostremission therapy. Growth factors are not routinely recommended in \npostremission therapy, except in life -threatening infections or when signs \nand symptoms of sepsis are present and the leukemia is believed to be in \nremission.   \nSupportive Care for Patients with AML  Who Prefer Not to \nReceive Blood Transfusions   \nThere is no established treatment of AML that does not require use of \nblood and blood products for supportive care , and with limited data, \nproviding guidelines or recommendations for AML management in this \ncontext is challenging .

Consider referring \nthe patient to centers with expertise in bloodless autologous \ntransplant.446,447 In addition, for patients who are Jehovah’s Witnesses \nand for this reason refuse blood transfusions, the U.S. branch of the \nChristian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witness es has Hospital Liaison \nCommittees that may provide helpful information about bloodless \nmedicine .448 \nRegarding treatment options, the Panel recommends considering less \nmyelosuppressive induction including dose reduction of anthracyclines \nand use of nonintensive chemotherapy.449-453 Some of these options may \ninclude targeted agents guided by testing for actionable mutations instead \nof intensive chemotherapy, especially in a noncurative setting. However, \nthe Panel notes that dose reductions in chemotherapy without transfusion \nsupport in patients with AML is associated with a lower rate of remission, \nhigh mortality by severe anemia, and  is unlikely to result in durable \nremissions.452 During treatment, measures should be taken to minimize \nblood loss and decrease the risk of bleeding , including: using  pediatric \ncollection tubes; avoiding concomitant medications or procedures that \nincrease the risk of bleeding or myelosuppression; using  oral \ncontraceptive pills or medroxyprogesterone acetate in menstruating \nindividuals ; or using proton pump inhibitors, as indicated.446,454 Vitamin K \nmay be considered as an adjuvant to improve  coagulopathy.446,454 In \npatients at risk of bleeding (eg, when platelet counts drop below 30  x \n10/9L), aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid may be considered to \nmanage bleeding.446,454 In patients with elemental or vitamin deficiencies , consider iron, folate, and vitamin B12 supplementation  if deficient .446,454 In \npatients with severe anemia, consider bed rest and supplemental \noxygenation.446,454 \nFor other general and supportive care considerations, see General \nConsiderations and Supportive Care for Patients with AML Who Prefer Not \nto Receive Blood Transfusions  in the algorithm.  \nEvaluation and Treatment of CNS Leukemia  \nLeptomeningeal involvement is much less frequent ( <3%) in patients with \nAML than in those with ALL; therefore, the Panel does not recommend LP \nas part of the routine diagnostic workup. However, if neurologic symptoms \n(eg, headache, confusion, altered sensory input) are present at diagnosis, \nan initial CT/MRI should be performed to rule out the possibility of \nmeningeal disease, chloromas or other mass lesions, or CNS bleeding . If \nno mass effect is seen, cerebrospinal fluid cytology should be sampled by \nLP. If the LP is negative for leukemic cells, the patient can be followed with \na repeat LP if symptoms persist. If the LP is positive by morphology or \nimmunotype by flow cytometry, IT chemotherapy is recommended, given \nconcurrently with systemic induction thera py. If LP result is equivocal, \nconsider repeating LP with morphology or immunotype by flow cytometry \nto delineate involvement. IT therapy may include agents such as IT \nmethotrexate or IT cytarabine either alone or combined. The selection of \nagents and dose  schedules for IT therapy largely depend on the specific \nclinical situation (eg, extent of CNS leukemia, symptoms, systemic \ntherapies given concurrently) and institutional practices. Initially, IT therapy \nis generally given twice weekly until the cytology shows no blasts, and \nthen weekly for 4 to 6 weeks. Importantly, IT therapy should only be \nadministered by clinicians with experience and expertise in the delivery of \nIT agents.

If the results are positive, then RT is \nrecommended, followed by IT therapy, as described earlier. IT therapy or \ndoses of cytarabine ≥2 g/m2 should not be administered concurrently with \ncranial RT because of the increased risks of neurotoxicity.

Management of Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell \nNeoplasm  \nBPDCN is a rare myeloid malignancy , representing only 0.44% of \nhematologic malignancies , with an incidence of 0.04 cases per 100,000 \npeople in the United States .455-457 BPDCN, which was formerly known as \nblastic natural killer cell lymphoma or granular CD4+/CD56+  \nhematodermic neoplasm, was renamed in the 2008 WHO classification \nwith the evolving knowledge of its plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC ) \norigin.458,459 In 2016, it was recognized as a unique myeloid malignancy.32 \nPathologically, i t is characterized by aggressive proliferation of precursors \nof PDCs.460,461 The etiology of BPDCN is unknown, but its association with \nMDS  or CMML  in some cases may suggest a related pathogenesis.460,462 \nBPDCN is associated with a  poor prognosis, with median OS of \napproximately 8  to 12 months when patients are treated with \nchemotherapy.461,463 Median age of presentation is in the  sixth decade of \nlife, with an approximate male -to-female ratio of 3:1  up to 5:1 .457,461 The \nmost frequent clinical presentation of typical BPDCN cases is \nasymptomatic solitary or multiple skin lesions that can disseminate rapidly \nwithout  therapy.460,461 Peripheral blood and bone marrow involvement may \nbe minimal at presentation, but tend to develop as the disease progresses . \nAdditional sites of involvement can include lymph nodes, spleen, and other \nextramedullary organs .459,460,464 Less commonly, patients may present with \nfeatures of an acute leukemia without skin manifestations.461 CNS \ninvolvement is not infrequent ; approximately 10% of patients who present \nwith neurological symptoms at diagnosis have confirmed CNS \ninvolvement465 and rates of CNS involvement, both at diagnosis and at \nrelapse, have been found to be in the range of 9 % to 26% in several \nadditional studies.461,466,467  PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

MS-77 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nWorkup  \nThe evaluation and initial workup for suspected BPDCN consists of a \ncomprehensive medical history and physical examination. Laboratory \nevaluations include a comprehensive metabolic panel and a CBC \nincluding platelets and a differential of WBCs. Analyses of  peripheral \nblasts, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, biopsy of skin lesions and, if \nsuspected to be involved, lymph nodes and other tissues are \nrecommended. These analyses should include dendritic cell morphology \nassessment, IHC, flow cytometry, cytogeneti c analysis, and molecular \nanalyses. Close collaboration with dermatology is recommended. It is \nessential to differentiate the skin lesions of BPDCN from other neoplastic \nand non -neoplastic skin lesions and rashes, including leukemia cutis \nassociated with AML, and analysis by experienced hematopathologists is \noften required.459 For guidance on classification and measurement of skin \nlesions, see the NCCN Guidelines for Primary Cutaneous Lymphomas . If \nextramedullary disease and/or lymphadenopathy is suspected, a n \nFDG -PET/CT scan is recommended. All patients require a diagnostic LP \nwith IT chemotherapy at the time of initial diagnosis,  at disease relapse, or \nany other time when there is a clinical  suspicion for CNS involvement. \nSubsequent IT chemotherapy prophylaxis should be considered, even in \nthe absence of known CNS disease  given the high percentage (30%) of \nprimary CNS involvement at relapse .457,459    \nThe diagnosis of BPDCN can be difficult due to overlapping morphologic, \nimmunophenotypic, and clinical features of other hematologic \nmalignancies, such as AML.459 This is particularly true when BPDCN \npresents as isolated cutaneous lesions, as biopsy specimens from \ncutaneous lesions may not yield sufficient cells for appropriate flow \ncytometric analysis.459 A diagnosis of BPDCN requires expression of at \nleast 4 of these 6 antigens on malignant cells: CD123 (also referred to as interleukin -3 receptor -alpha [IL3Rα]), CD4, CD56, TCL -1, CD2AP, and \nCD303/BDCA -2, in the absence of lineage -specific markers.459,460 \nTCF4/CD123 coexpression has also been found to be a sensitive and \nspecific diagnostic marker for BPDCN.468,469 CD303 is emerging as \nanother marker useful in the diagnosis of BPDCN and may serve as a \npotential marker for further directed therapy.470 BPDCN must be \ndistinguished from mature plasmacytoid dendritic cell proliferation \n(MPDCP) in which PDCs are morphologically mature and \nCD56 -negative.460 In addition, recurrent mutations in the following genes \nhave been described: ASXL1 , ETV6 , IDH1 , IDH2 , IKZF1 , IKZF2 , IKZF3 , \nNPM1 , NRAS , TET1 , TET2 , SRSF2 , TP53 , U2AF1 , ZEB2 , and \nZRSR2 .459,460,471 -473 \nInduction Therapy for Patients with BPDCN  \nGiven the rarity of BPDCN, no standardized chemotherapy approach has \nbeen established.461 Historically , therapeutic approaches have varied \nwidely and have included irradiation for localized skin lesions, \nlymphoma - or leukemia -type chemotherapy regimens, and HCT.474 \nDespite good initial responses to chemotherapy, with response rates of \n40% to 90%,459 early relapse rates are high, even among those who \nachieve CR.459,461,474 CD123 -targeted therapy with tagraxofusp -ersz has \nmore recently emerged as the preferred treatment option in appropriate \ncandidates.   \nRecently, a collaborative initiative, the North American BPDCN \nConsortium (NABC), made up of a group of experts from multiple areas of \nexpertise, has been formed to define the current standard of care for \nmanagement of BPDCN and to identify future areas of  research.457 PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

MS-78 \n NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 \nAcute Myeloid Leukemia  \n \nCD123 -Targeted Therapy  \nCD123, or IL3Rα, overexpression is present in virtually all cases of \nBPDCN.464 Tagraxofusp (formerly SL -401) is a recombinant fusion protein \nmade up of the catalytic and translocation domains of diphtheria toxin \nfused to IL3 that has shown activity against BPDCN.  \nThe first prospective study of treatment of patients with BPDCN  included  \n11 patients with recurrent or refractory BPDCN or who were not \ncandidates for chemotherapy were treated with SL -401.475 Each cycle of \nSL-401 treatment was comprised of a 12.5  µg/kg dose administered over \na 15-minute infusion every day for up to 5 doses. Of 9 evaluable patients \nwho received treatment, 5 had a CR and 2 had a PR after 1 cycle of \nSL-401 treatment (78% ORR ). The median duration of response was 5 \nmonths (range, 1  to 20+ months), with responses occurring in all sites of \ndisease, including skin, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Acute \ninfusion -related adverse events such as fever, chills, and nausea were \nmild to moderate in severity and were most commonly seen within the first \nseveral hours after SL -401 inf usion; however, these symptoms were \noccasionally noted up to 4  to 8 hours following infusion. Premedications \nincluding acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone, and \nfamotidine were given, likely mitigating these events. Resulting symptoms \nfollowing infusion responded to additional dosing of acetaminophen, \nmeper idine, antiemetics, and/or H1 - and H2 -histamine antagonists. These \nacute infusion -related events may be related to cytokine release from \nnecrotic cells and damaged BPDCN blasts. Most patient s experienced one \nor more symptoms suggestive of vascular or capillary leak syndrome, such \nas hypoalbuminemia, edema, hypotension, and hyponatremia. \nHypoalbuminemia was the most consistent and early manifestation of \ncapillary leak syndrome (grade 1 in 4 pa tients, grade 2 in 6 patients). \nSymptoms of capillary leak syndrome were managed by the administration of parenteral albumin and diuretics. Though several patients experienced \ngrade 3 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, myelosuppression was \ngenerally modest and reversible, potentially reflecting the minimal \nexpression of IL3R on normal myeloid progenitors. Many patients \nexperienced transaminitis without hyperbilirubinemia, with onset typically 5  \nto 10 days post -infusion and with full resolution typically 15  to 21 days \nfollowing infusion.  \nIn a multicohort study by Pemmaraju and colleagues, 84 patients with \nuntreated or relapsed BPDCN were treated with an IV infusion of \ntagraxofusp at a dose of 12 µg/kg on days 1 to 5 of each 21 -day cycle.476 \nTreatment was given until disease progression or unacceptable adverse \neffects. Of the 84 patients, 65 received first -line treatment and 19 had \nreceived prior treatment. Among evaluable patients who received first -line \ntreatment of tagraxofusp, the primary outcome (CR and clinical CR) was \nobserved in 57% of patients , ORR was 75%, and median OS was 15.8 \nmonths . Of the patients who achieved CR or clinical CR following first -line \ntreatment of tagraxofusp, 51% were successfully bridged to HCT  \n(allogeneic HCT, n = 13; autologous HCT, n = 6)  while in remission and \nmedian OS in this subgroup was 38.4 months. Of the 18 patients who \nachieved CR or clinical CR following first -line treatment who did not \nproceed to HCT, 4 had duration of responses >6 months. Among the 19 \npatients who had received prior therapy, ORR was 58% with a median OS \nof 8.2 months. Among  this subgroup, 1 patient was successfully bridged to \nHCT.  Based on earlier  data from this trial,464 the FDA approved \ntagraxofusp -erzs for the treatment of BPDCN in adults and pediatric \npatients ≥2 years of age  in 2018 .  \nThe most common adverse events noted in the Pemmaraju study were \nincreased levels of alanine aminotransferase  (ALT)  and aspartate PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

Median time to onset of capillary leak syndrome was 6 days \n(range , 3–51 days), with a median duration of 6 days (range , 3–69 days). \nCapillary leak syndrome was managed by withholding further doses of \ntagraxofusp, administering IV albumin  or glucocorticoids, and careful \nmanagement of volume status.  \nChemotherapy  \nIn a retrospective multicenter study, 41 patients with BPDCN received \ninduction treatment with AML -type regimens (n = 26) and \nALL-type/lymphoma -type regimens (n = 15).461 The AML -type treatment \nprotocols included MEC ; idarubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide  (ICE);  \nstandard -dose cytarabine and anthracycline (7  + 3); FLAG ; and \nFLAG -IDA. The ALL/lymphoma -type regimens included hyper -CVAD \n(alternative cycles of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, \ndoxorubicin, dexamethasone, methotrexate, and cytarabine), GIMEMA \nALL trial therapy (association of doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and \nasparaginase), CHOP (cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin, vincristine, and \nprednisone), and CHOEP (CHOP plus etoposide). There were patients \nwho required additional therapy based on extramedullary disease (4 \npatients received IT chemotherapy for CNS involvement and 2 patients \nreceived RT for skin lesions). Fourteen percent  of patients underwent \nallogeneic HCT at some point in their course of therapy. After induction, \nthe overall CR rate was 41%, with 7 patients achieving CR after AML -type \ninduction, and 10 patients achieving CR after ALL -type induction. The \nmedian OS was 8.7 months (range, 0.2 –32.9), and patients who received \nALL-type chemotherapy appeared to have longer OS compared to patients treated with AML -type chemotherapy (12.3 vs. 7.1 months, \nrespectively; P = .02). In addition, the median OS of patients who received  \ntransplant was significantly higher than non -transplanted patients (22.7 vs. \n7.1 months, respectively; P = .03). Age was also noted to be a significant \nprognostic factor, with a median OS of 12.6 months in patients <65 years \ncompared to 7.1 months for those >65 years ( P = .04). Relaps es occurred \nin 35% of patients at a median of 9.1 months.  \nAn additional retrospective study analyzed the impact of 4 different \nchemotherapeutic approaches: 1) local therapy or systemic regimens less \nintensive than CHOP ; 2) CHOP and CHOP -like regimens ; 3) acute \nleukemia regimens ; and 4) allogeneic or autologous HCT.474 Therapies \nless intensive than CHOP were a heterogenous group, including local \nradiation, systemic steroids, and supportive care, but were mostly \ncyclophosphamide -based chemotherapy regimens. Though this group had \na high ORR of 80% (68% CR), only 7% of patients had a sustained CR \nand the median OS for evaluable patients was 9 months. Patients in the \nCHOP and CHOP -like regimens arm had similar results despite therapy \nbeing more aggressive, with an ORR of 70% (55% CR) and only 1 case of \nsustained CR. Intensiv e acute leukemia regimens resulted in a CR rate of \n94%, with approximately one-third of patients experiencing a sustained \nCR. There were 10 evaluable patients in the HCT arm (6 allogeneic, 4 \nautologous). Median OS was 38.5 months in the allogeneic arm compared \nto 16.5 months in the autologous arm.

Five \nof the six patients who responded to therapy received planned allogeneic \nHCT. With a median follow -up of 13.3 months, the 1-year DFS and OS \nrates for all patients were 56% and 67%, respectively. The 1 -year DFS for \nthose who received allogeneic HCT was 80%.

Fifty-one percent  of patients \nin the hyper -CVAD –based group were bridged to HCT, compared to 49% \nof patients in the tagraxofusp  group and 38% in the other regimens group, \nrespectively ( P = .455). This study suggests a continued role for \nhyper -CVAD –based regimens in the targeted -therapy era.  \nVenetoclax -Based Regimens  \nThe antiapoptotic protein BCL2 is overexpressed in a majority of patients \nwith BPDCN.428 Venetoclax is an oral selective BCL2 inhibitor approved in \ncombination with azacitidine, decitabine, or low dose cytarabine (LDAC) \nfor the treatment of newly -diagnosed AML in patients ≥75 years or for \nthose who are otherwise not candidates for intensive remission induction \ntherapy. In vitro, BPDCN cells were found to be uniformly sensitive to venetoclax in a study that measured direct cytotoxicity, apoptosis assays, \nand dynamic BH3 profiling.479 \nA retrospective study assessed the efficacy of venetoclax combinations in \na total of 43 patients with R/R myeloid malignancies, including 2 patients \nwith BPDCN.428 The most common treatment regimens included \nvenetoclax with decitabine (53%), azacitidine (19%), and LDAC (19%). \nPatients  had been previously treated with a median of 3 prior lines of \ntherapy, including allogeneic HCT in 12% of patients. While ORR was \nseen in 21% of patients, n either of the 2 patients with BPDCN who were \nevaluated achieved a response by formal criteria, though  1 patient had a \nmajor response by PET/CT, bone marrow blast reduction of >50%, and \nimprovement in cutaneous lesions. The other pati ent with BPDCN also \nhad a significant improvement in cutaneous lesions. All patients who \nreceived venetoclax combination therapy experienced grade 3 or higher \nneutropenia and 72% developed a grade 3 or higher infection, most \ncommonly pneumonia , bacteremia, cellulitis, invasive fungal infections, \nand urinary tract infections. All patients were given allopurinol for TLS \nprophylaxis, and none developed hyperuricemia that required \nrasburicase.428 Venetoclax in combination with HMAs  appears to have \nefficacy in BPDCN, but larger and more formalized studies are necessary \nto confirm these observations.   \nHematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  \nDue to the rarity of BPDCN, there have been limited established \nstandardized therapeutic approaches.480 HCT seems to generate durable \nremissions, especially if given in first CR, as indicated by the studies \ndiscussed in the chemotherapy section, as well as others.458,461,474,477,480,481 \nHowever, it is worth noting that data are limited to small case series and PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

The \n1-year OS for autologous HCT recipients was 11% (95% CI, 8% –50%).  \nA more recent retrospective study evaluated 162 adults with BPDCN that \nunderwent first HCT (allogeneic HCT, n = 146; autologous HCT, n = 16), \n78% of whom were in first CR.482 Among the allogeneic HCT group, 54% received MAC, 46% received RIC, and 59% received in -vivo T -cell \ndepletion (TDC). TBI was used in 61% of MAC transplants and 26% of \nRIC transplants. Comparable one -year OS and PFS rates were seen \nfollowing allogeneic and autologous HCT (OS , 66 vs . 70%; PFS , 62% vs . \n66%). TBI as the conditioning backbone in allogeneic HCT led to \nsignificant improvements in OS and PFS compared to all other \nconditioning regimens. Adjusted 2 -year PFS for MAC with TBI was 95% \ncompared to 82% for MAC without TBI, 41% for RIC with TBI, and 60% for \nRIC without TBI, respectively.  \nNCCN Recommendations  \nFor patients who are candidates for intensive remission induction therapy, \nthe Panel recommends tagraxofusp -ersz as a preferred option, and other \noptions include AML -type (standard -dose cytarabine plus anthracycline \nusing 7  + 3), ALL -type (hyper -CVAD), and lymphoma -type (CHOP) \nregimens.  If CNS disease is documented at diagnosis, IT chemotherapy \nshould also be given. If CNS disease is not present at diagnosis, \nprophylactic IT chemotherapy is strongly encouraged.  \nTagraxofusp -ersz should be administered as an IV infusion at 12 µg/kg \nover 15 minutes once daily on days 1 to 5 of each 21 -day cycle. \nAlternatively, 5 doses can be administered over a 10 -day period, if needed \nfor dose delays. It is important to note that patients must have a baseline \nserum albumin of ≥3.2 g/dL to be able to start treatment with this agent. \nThe most serious side effect associated with tagraxofusp is capillary leak \nsyndrome, which can occur during the first cycle of treatment and can be \nlife-threatening.464 A decrease in serum albumin during the first days of \ntreatment seems to be the most consistent predictor of capillary leak \nsyndrome.464 Management includes delaying or withholding additional \ntagraxofusp doses, administering IV albumin according to pre -specified PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.

The Panel also \nrecommends premedication with an H1 -histamine antagonist, \nacetaminophen, corticosteroid, and H2 -histamine antagonist prior to each \ninfusion to help reduce the risk of hypersensitivity reaction.  \nWith all treatment options, if CR is observed, allogeneic HCT or \nautologous HCT should be considered. If tagraxofusp -erzs was given as \nan initial treatment and HCT is not feasible, additional cycles of \ntagraxofusp -erzs should be continued until disease progression. If disease \nprogresses or does not respond to induction therapy, patients should be \nconsidered for a clinical trial (preferred), or regimens used for R/R \ndisease.  \nFor patients with low performance and/or nutritional status (ie, serum \nalbumin <3.2 g/dL) or for those who are not candidates for intensive \nremission induction therapy or tagraxofusp -ersz, treatment options are \nlimited. If disease is localized or isolated to cutaneous involvement, \npalliative treatment options include surgical excision or focal radiation. If \ndisease is systemic, palliative options include low -intensity therapy with \nvenetoclax -based regimens , steroids , and supportive care.  \nFor patients with CNS disease, CNS -directed IT chemotherapy, preferably \nwith alternating cytarabine with methotrexate, or triple IT agents \n(cytarabine, methotrexate, steroid) is recommended twice weekly until \nCSF cytology is negative. Once CSF cytology is negative, weekly IT \ntreatment should be continued for at least 4 doses, then twice per month \nfor a total of at least 8 doses. Ongoing prophylaxis thereafter with IT \ntreatments once or twice per month may be considered . Postremission Surveillance for BPDCN  \nFollowing completion of consolidation therapy, it is recommended to \nmonitor a CBC, including platelets, every 1 to 3 months for the first 2 \nyears, then every 3 to 6 months thereafter for up to 5 years. Bone marrow \nevaluation should be performed only if cyt openias develop or if peripheral \nsmear is abnormal, rather than as routine surveillance at fixed intervals, \nunless the bone marrow evaluation is being performed as part of a clinical \nresearch protocol. For patients with prior evidence of extramedullary \ndisease, a repeat FDG -PET/CT scan is recommended. In addition, routine \nthorough skin exams with a re -biopsy should occur for any suspicious skin \nor extramedullary lesions.  \nManagement of Relapsed /Refractory  BPDCN  \nUpon relapse, the NCCN AML Panel recommends evaluating for CNS \ndisease and administering IT  chemotherapy  prophylaxis.465 Management \noptions for R/R BPDCN include clinical trial (preferred), tagraxofusp -ersz \n(preferred, if not already used),464,476 chemotherapy (if not already given), \nlocal radiation to isolated lesions, systemic steroids, or venetoclax -based \nregimens.428,479 During administration of any treatment option, a donor \nsearch should also be started at first relapse in appropriate patients if no \nsibling donor has been identified.PLEASE NOTE that use of this NCCN Content is governed by the End-User License Agreement, and you MAY NOT distribute this Content or use it with any artificial intelligence model or tool.\nPrinted by Kevin Luo on 7/21/2025 5:16:46 PM.
