# Management of Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities - Sample Guidelines

## Overview
Comprehensive management strategies for immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with cancer immunotherapy.

## General Principles
1. **Early Recognition**: Monitor for symptoms during and after treatment
2. **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Involve specialists as needed
3. **Patient Education**: Inform patients about potential toxicities
4. **Proactive Management**: Treat early to prevent severe complications

## Common Immune-Related Adverse Events

### Dermatologic Toxicities
**Grade 1-2 (Mild-Moderate)**:
- Topical corticosteroids
- Antihistamines for pruritus
- Moisturizers and gentle skin care
- Continue immunotherapy with monitoring

**Grade 3-4 (Severe)**:
- Hold immunotherapy
- Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day)
- Dermatology consultation
- Consider permanent discontinuation

### Gastrointestinal Toxicities
**Colitis (Most Common)**:
- **Grade 1**: Symptomatic management, continue treatment
- **Grade 2**: Hold immunotherapy, oral corticosteroids
- **Grade 3-4**: Hospitalization, IV corticosteroids, gastroenterology consult

**Hepatitis**:
- Monitor liver function tests
- Grade 2+: Hold immunotherapy, consider corticosteroids
- Grade 3-4: Permanent discontinuation, hepatology consult

### Endocrine Toxicities
**Thyroid Dysfunction**:
- Monitor TSH and free T4
- Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine replacement
- Hyperthyroidism: Beta-blockers, consider endocrinology

**Adrenal Insufficiency**:
- Monitor cortisol and ACTH
- Hydrocortisone replacement
- Endocrinology consultation

**Type 1 Diabetes**:
- Monitor blood glucose
- Insulin therapy
- Endocrinology consultation

### Pulmonary Toxicities
**Pneumonitis**:
- **Grade 1**: Monitor closely, continue treatment
- **Grade 2**: Hold immunotherapy, oral corticosteroids
- **Grade 3-4**: Hospitalization, IV corticosteroids, pulmonology consult

### Neurologic Toxicities
**Myasthenia Gravis**:
- Neurology consultation
- Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
- Immunosuppressive therapy
- Consider plasmapheresis

**Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome**:
- Neurology consultation
- IV immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis
- Permanent discontinuation

## Management Algorithm

### Step 1: Assessment
1. Determine toxicity grade (1-4)
2. Identify affected organ system
3. Assess patient's overall condition
4. Review concurrent medications

### Step 2: Treatment Decision
1. **Grade 1**: Continue immunotherapy, symptomatic care
2. **Grade 2**: Hold immunotherapy, oral corticosteroids
3. **Grade 3**: Hold immunotherapy, IV corticosteroids
4. **Grade 4**: Permanent discontinuation, aggressive treatment

### Step 3: Monitoring
1. Daily assessment for improvement
2. Laboratory monitoring as indicated
3. Imaging studies if needed
4. Specialist consultation

## Corticosteroid Management
- **Prednisone**: 1-2 mg/kg/day for moderate toxicities
- **Methylprednisolone**: 1-2 mg/kg/day IV for severe toxicities
- **Tapering**: Gradual reduction over 4-6 weeks
- **Monitoring**: Watch for rebound toxicity

## Rechallenge Considerations
- **Grade 1**: Usually safe to continue
- **Grade 2**: May rechallenge after resolution
- **Grade 3**: Consider permanent discontinuation
- **Grade 4**: Permanent discontinuation

## Prevention Strategies
1. **Baseline Assessment**: Complete history and physical
2. **Risk Stratification**: Identify high-risk patients
3. **Patient Education**: Symptom recognition
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Laboratory and clinical assessment

## Emergency Management
- **Severe toxicities**: Immediate hospitalization
- **Life-threatening**: ICU care, aggressive immunosuppression
- **Multidisciplinary team**: Involve all relevant specialists
- **Supportive care**: Maintain organ function
