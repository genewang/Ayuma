# Breast Cancer Treatment Guidelines - Sample Reference

## Overview
This document provides a sample structure for breast cancer treatment guidelines based on current medical standards and NCCN framework.

## Staging and Classification
- **Stage 0**: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
- **Stage I**: Tumor â‰¤2cm, no lymph node involvement
- **Stage II**: Tumor 2-5cm or lymph node involvement
- **Stage III**: Locally advanced disease
- **Stage IV**: Metastatic disease

## Treatment Recommendations

### Early-Stage Breast Cancer (Stage I-II)
1. **Surgical Options**:
   - Breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) + radiation
   - Mastectomy with or without reconstruction
   - Sentinel lymph node biopsy

2. **Adjuvant Therapy**:
   - Chemotherapy for high-risk features
   - Hormone therapy for ER/PR positive tumors
   - Targeted therapy for HER2 positive tumors

### Locally Advanced Breast Cancer (Stage III)
1. **Neoadjuvant Therapy**:
   - Chemotherapy before surgery
   - Targeted therapy for HER2 positive
   - Consider immunotherapy trials

2. **Surgical Management**:
   - Modified radical mastectomy
   - Axillary lymph node dissection

### Metastatic Breast Cancer (Stage IV)
1. **First-line Treatment**:
   - Hormone therapy for ER/PR positive
   - Chemotherapy for triple-negative
   - Targeted therapy for HER2 positive

2. **Subsequent Lines**:
   - CDK4/6 inhibitors
   - PI3K inhibitors
   - Immunotherapy options

## Follow-up Care
- Physical examination every 3-6 months
- Mammography annually
- Bone density monitoring
- Survivorship care planning

## Supportive Care
- Pain management
- Fatigue management
- Psychological support
- Nutritional counseling

## Clinical Trials
- Encourage participation in appropriate clinical trials
- Consider genomic testing for targeted therapy options
- Discuss immunotherapy options for eligible patients
