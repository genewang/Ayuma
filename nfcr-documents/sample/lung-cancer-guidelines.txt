# Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Treatment Guidelines - Sample Reference

## Overview
Comprehensive treatment guidelines for NSCLC based on current evidence and NCCN framework.

## Staging System (TNM 8th Edition)
- **Stage I**: T1-2, N0, M0
- **Stage II**: T1-2, N1, M0 or T3, N0, M0
- **Stage III**: T1-3, N2, M0 or T4, N0-1, M0
- **Stage IV**: Any T, Any N, M1

## Molecular Testing Requirements
- **EGFR mutations**
- **ALK rearrangements**
- **ROS1 rearrangements**
- **BRAF mutations**
- **PD-L1 expression**
- **KRAS mutations**
- **MET exon 14 skipping**
- **RET rearrangements**

## Treatment by Stage

### Stage I-II (Early Stage)
1. **Surgical Resection**:
   - Lobectomy (preferred)
   - Segmentectomy for small tumors
   - Wedge resection for limited pulmonary function

2. **Adjuvant Therapy**:
   - Chemotherapy for high-risk Stage II
   - Consider targeted therapy for driver mutations
   - Adjuvant immunotherapy for Stage IIB

### Stage III (Locally Advanced)
1. **Resectable Stage IIIA**:
   - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± immunotherapy
   - Surgical resection
   - Adjuvant therapy based on molecular profile

2. **Unresectable Stage III**:
   - Concurrent chemoradiation
   - Consolidation immunotherapy
   - Consider surgery if downstaged

### Stage IV (Metastatic)
1. **First-line Treatment**:
   - **EGFR positive**: Osimertinib (preferred)
   - **ALK positive**: Alectinib, Brigatinib, or Ceritinib
   - **PD-L1 ≥50%**: Pembrolizumab monotherapy
   - **PD-L1 <50%**: Chemotherapy + immunotherapy
   - **No driver mutation**: Chemotherapy + immunotherapy

2. **Second-line and Beyond**:
   - Targeted therapy for resistance mutations
   - Immunotherapy for PD-L1 positive
   - Chemotherapy options
   - Clinical trial participation

## Supportive Care
- **Pain Management**: Opioids, nerve blocks, radiation
- **Fatigue Management**: Exercise, energy conservation
- **Nutritional Support**: Dietitian consultation
- **Psychological Support**: Counseling, support groups

## Follow-up and Surveillance
- **Years 1-2**: Every 3-6 months
- **Years 3-5**: Every 6 months
- **Year 5+**: Annually
- **Imaging**: CT chest/abdomen/pelvis
- **Laboratory**: Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel

## Clinical Trials
- Encourage participation in appropriate trials
- Consider genomic profiling for targeted therapy
- Discuss immunotherapy combinations
- Explore novel targeted agents
